AB  - Limited evidence is available regarding long-term outcomes of opioids compared with nonopioid medications for chronic pain.To compare opioid vs nonopioid medications over 12 months on pain-related function, pain intensity, and adverse effects.Pragmatic, 12-month, randomized trial with masked outcome assessment. Patients were recruited from Veterans Affairs primary care clinics from June 2013 through December 2015; follow-up was completed December 2016. Eligible patients had moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain despite analgesic use. Of 265 patients enrolled, 25 withdrew prior to randomization and 240 were randomized.Both interventions (opioid and nonopioid medication therapy) followed a treat-to-target strategy aiming for improved pain and function. Each intervention had its own prescribing strategy that included multiple medication options in 3 steps. In the opioid group, the first step was immediate-release morphine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone/acetaminophen. For the nonopioid group, the first step was acetaminophen (paracetamol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Medications were changed, added, or adjusted within the assigned treatment group according to individual patient response.The primary outcome was pain-related function (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] interference scale) over 12 months and the main secondary outcome was pain intensity (BPI severity scale). For both BPI scales (range, 0-10; higher scores = worse function or pain intensity), a 1-point improvement was clinically important. The primary adverse outcome was medication-related symptoms (patient-reported checklist; range, 0-19).Among 240 randomized patients (mean age, 58.3 years; women, 32 [13.0%]), 234 (97.5%) completed the trial. Groups did not significantly differ on pain-related function over 12 months (overall P = .58); mean 12-month BPI interference was 3.4 for the opioid group and 3.3 for the nonopioid group (difference, 0.1 [95% CI, -0.5 to 0.7]). Pain intensity was significantly better in the nonopioid group over 12 months (overall P = .03); mean 12-month BPI severity was 4.0 for the opioid group and 3.5 for the nonopioid group (difference, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.0 to 1.0]). Adverse medication-related symptoms were significantly more common in the opioid group over 12 months (overall P = .03); mean medication-related symptoms at 12 months were 1.8 in the opioid group and 0.9 in the nonopioid group (difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.5]).Treatment with opioids was not superior to treatment with nonopioid medications for improving pain-related function over 12 months. Results do not support initiation of opioid therapy for moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01583985.

AB  - Background A brief, inexpensive screening test for sarcopenia would be helpful for clinicians and their patients. To screen for persons with sarcopenia, we developed a simple five-item questionnaire (SARC-F) based on cardinal features or consequences of sarcopenia. Methods We investigated the utility of SARC-F in the African American Health (AAH) study, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Internal consistency reliability for SARC-F was determined using Cronbach's alpha. We evaluated SARC-F factorial validity using principal components analysis and criterion validity by examining its association with exam-based indicators of sarcopenia. Construct validity was examined using cross-sectional and longitudinal differences among those with high (≥4) vs. low (<4) SARC-F scores for mortality and health outcomes. Results SARC-F exhibited good internal consistency reliability and factorial, criterion, and construct validity. AAH participants with SARC-F scores ≥ 4 had more Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) deficits, slower chair stand times, lower grip strength, lower short physical performance battery scores, and a higher likelihood of recent hospitalization and of having a gait speed of <0.8 m/s. SARC-F scores ≥ 4 in AAH also were associated with 6 year IADL deficits, slower chair stand times, lower short physical performance battery scores, having a gait speed of <0.8 m/s, being hospitalized recently, and mortality. SARC-F scores ≥ 4 in the BLSA cohort were associated with having more IADL deficits and lower grip strength (both hands) in cross-sectional comparisons and with IADL deficits, lower grip strength (both hands), and mortality at follow-up. NHANES participants with SARC-F scores ≥ 4 had slower 20 ft walk times, had lower peak force knee extensor strength, and were more likely to have been hospitalized recently in cross-sectional analyses. Conclusions The SARC-F proved internally consistent and valid for detecting persons at risk for adverse outcomes from sarcopenia in AAH, BLSA, and NHANES.

AB  - Somatic symptoms are the core features of many medical diseases, and they are used to evaluate the severity and course of illness. The 8-item Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) was recently developed as a brief, patient-reported outcome measure of somatic symptom burden, but its reliability, validity, and usefulness have not yet been tested.To investigate the reliability, validity, and severity categories as well as the reference scores of the SSS-8.A national, representative general-population survey was performed between June 15, 2012, and July 15, 2012, in Germany, including 2510 individuals older than 13 years.The SSS-8 mean (SD), item-total correlations, Cronbach α, factor structure, associations with measures of construct validity (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 depression scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scale, visual analog scale for general health status, 12-month health care use), severity categories, and percentile rank reference scores.The SSS-8 had excellent item characteristics and good reliability (Cronbach α = 0.81). The factor structure reflects gastrointestinal, pain, fatigue, and cardiopulmonary aspects of the general somatic symptom burden. Somatic symptom burden as measured by the SSS-8 was significantly associated with depression (r = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.60]), anxiety (r = 0.55 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.58]), general health status (r = -0.24 [95% CI, -0.28 to -0.20]), and health care use (incidence rate ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.14]). The SSS-8 severity categories were calculated in accordance with percentile ranks: no to minimal (0-3 points), low (4-7 points), medium (8-11 points), high (12-15 points), and very high (16-32 points) somatic symptom burden. For every SSS-8 severity category increase, there was a 53% (95% CI, 44% to 63%) increase in health care visits.The SSS-8 is a reliable and valid self-report measure of somatic symptom burden. Cutoff scores identify individuals with low, medium, high, and very high somatic symptom burden.

AB  - Purpose To provide guidance to oncology clinicians on how to use effective communication to optimize the patient-clinician relationship, patient and clinician well-being, and family well-being. Methods ASCO convened a multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, psychiatry, nursing, hospice and palliative medicine, communication skills, health disparities, and advocacy experts to produce recommendations. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process. The systematic review focused on guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials published from 2006 through October 1, 2016. Results The systematic review included 47 publications. With the exception of clinician training in communication skills, evidence for many of the clinical questions was limited. Draft recommendations underwent two rounds of consensus voting before being finalized. Recommendations In addition to providing guidance regarding core communication skills and tasks that apply across the continuum of cancer care, recommendations address specific topics, such as discussion of goals of care and prognosis, treatment selection, end-of-life care, facilitating family involvement in care, and clinician training in communication skills. Recommendations are accompanied by suggested strategies for implementation. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki .

AB  - There are limited data on the effectiveness of the vaccines against symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) currently authorized in the United States with respect to hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or ambulatory care in an emergency department or urgent care clinic.We conducted a study involving adults (≥50 years of age) with Covid-19-like illness who underwent molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed 41,552 admissions to 187 hospitals and 21,522 visits to 221 emergency departments or urgent care clinics during the period from January 1 through June 22, 2021, in multiple states. The patients' vaccination status was documented in electronic health records and immunization registries. We used a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated patients with those among unvaccinated patients. Vaccine effectiveness was adjusted with weights based on propensity-for-vaccination scores and according to age, geographic region, calendar time (days from January 1, 2021, to the index date for each medical visit), and local virus circulation.The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (≥14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 86 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. The effectiveness of full vaccination with respect to a Covid-19-associated hospitalization or emergency department or urgent care clinic visit was similar with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and ranged from 81% to 95% among adults 85 years of age or older, persons with chronic medical conditions, and Black or Hispanic adults. The effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 68% (95% CI, 50 to 79) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization and 73% (95% CI, 59 to 82) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.Covid-19 vaccines in the United States were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, or an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. This vaccine effectiveness extended to populations that are disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.).

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. Despite MBC’s demonstrated ability to enhance usual care by expediting improvements and rapidly detecting patients whose health would otherwise deteriorate, it is underused, with typically less than 20% of behavioral health practitioners integrating it into their practice. This narrative review addresses definitional issues, offers a concrete and evaluable operationalization of MBC fidelity, and summarizes the evidence base and utility of MBC. It also synthesizes the extant literature’s characterization of barriers to and strategies for supporting MBC implementation, sustainment, and scale-up. <h3>Observations</h3> Barriers to implementing MBC occur at multiple levels: patient (eg, concerns about confidentiality breach), practitioner (eg, beliefs that measures are no better than clinical judgment), organization (eg, no resources for training), and system (eg, competing requirements). Implementation science—the study of methods to integrate evidence-based practices such as MBC into routine care—offers strategies to address barriers. These strategies include using measurement feedback systems, leveraging local champions, forming learning collaboratives, training leadership, improving expert consultation with clinical staff, and generating incentives. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This narrative review, informed by implementation science, offers a 10-point research agenda to improve the integration of MBC into clinical practice: (1) harmonize terminology and specify MBC’s core components; (2) develop criterion standard methods for monitoring fidelity and reporting quality of implementation; (3) develop algorithms for MBC to guide psychotherapy; (4) test putative mechanisms of change, particularly for psychotherapy; (5) develop brief and psychometrically strong measures for use in combination; (6) assess the critical timing of administration needed to optimize patient outcomes; (7) streamline measurement feedback systems to include only key ingredients and enhance electronic health record interoperability; (8) identify discrete strategies to support implementation; (9) make evidence-based policy decisions; and (10) align reimbursement structures.

AB  - To determine how well the interview-based, clinic-friendly International Academy of Nutrition and Aging (FRAIL) frailty scale predicts future disability and mortality in the African American Health (AAH) cohort compared with the clinic-friendly Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) frailty scale, the phenotype-based Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty scale, and the comprehensive Frailty Index (FI).Longitudinal cohort study.Metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri.African American Health is a population-based panel study of African Americans (baseline age 49-65) from St. Louis, Missouri. Participants completed in-home assessments at baseline (N = 998) and 3- (n = 853) and 9- (n = 582) year follow-up.Outcomes included activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL difficulties at 3 and 9 years and 9-year mortality. Frailty measures included the FRAIL, SOF, and CHS scales and the FI.The FRAIL, SOF, CHS, and FI measures predicted new 3- and 9-year disability, and the FRAIL and FI scales predicted 9-year mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) contrasts showed that the FRAIL scale performed as well as (9-year disability and mortality) or better than (3-year disability) the CHS and SOF scales and the FI better than the FRAIL, CHS, and SOF scales for all outcomes except the FRAIL and CHS scales for 9-year ADL difficulties. The CHS and SOF scales were equivalent for all outcomes in ROC contrasts.Overall the FI and the FRAIL scale exhibited the strongest predictive validity for disability and mortality in AAH. The best prediction tool to identify frail individuals at risk of disability and mortality may be one that includes a comorbidity measure. The FRAIL scale includes a comorbidity item and is a brief interview-based measure that is easy to administer, score, and interpret. The FRAIL scale has demonstrated validity and may prove to be a valuable scale for use by clinicians.

AB  - Our objective was to obtain an in-depth understanding of autistic adults' experiences with healthcare and their recommendations for improving care. Our academic-community partnership used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 39 autistic adults and 16 people who had experience supporting autistic adults in healthcare settings. Participants identified patient-level, autism-related factors that impact healthcare interactions, including verbal communication skills, sensory sensitivities, challenges with body awareness, slow processing speed, atypical non-verbal communication, and challenges with organization. However, the success of healthcare interactions largely depended on the interplay between patient- and provider-level factors, as well as the larger context in which patients were receiving care. Provider-level factors included providers' knowledge about autism in adults, incorrect assumptions about individual patients, willingness to allow written communication, use of accessible language, openness to providing other accommodations, and skill in appropriately incorporating supporters. System-level factors included the availability of supporters, complexity of the healthcare system, accessibility of healthcare facilities, and stigma about autism. Further efforts are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the healthcare system, and decrease discrimination.

AB  - Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective We examine the reliability and validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS)—which combines the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale and seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale—as a composite measure of depression and anxiety. Methods Baseline data from 896 patients enrolled in two primary-care based trials of chronic pain and one oncology-practice–based trial of depression and pain were analyzed. The internal reliability, standard error of measurement, and convergent, construct, and factor structure validity, as well as sensitivity to change of the PHQ-ADS were examined. Results The PHQ-ADS demonstrated high internal reliability (Cronbach α values of .8 to .9) in all three trials. PHQ-ADS scores can range from 0 to 48 (with higher scores indicating more severe depression/anxiety), and the estimated standard error of measurement was approximately 3 to 4 points. The PHQ-ADS showed strong convergent (most correlations, 0.7–0.8 range) and construct (most correlations, 0.4–0.6 range) validity when examining its association with other mental health, quality of life, and disability measures. PHQ-ADS cutpoints of 10, 20, and 30 indicated mild, moderate, and severe levels of depression/anxiety, respectively. Bifactor analysis showed sufficient unidimensionality of the PHQ-ADS score. PHQ-ADS change scores at 3 months differentiated ( p &lt; .0001) between individuals classified as worse, stable, or improved by a reference measure, providing preliminary evidence for sensitivity to change. Conclusions The PHQ-ADS may be a reliable and valid composite measure of depression and anxiety which, if validated in other populations, could be useful as a single measure for jointly assessing two of the most common psychological conditions in clinical practice and research.

AB  - To review published empirical literature on the use of smartphone-based passive sensing for health and wellbeing. A systematic review of the English language literature was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Papers indexed in computing, technology, and medical databases were included if they were empirical, focused on health and/or wellbeing, involved the collection of data via smartphones, and described the utilized technology as passive or requiring minimal user interaction. Thirty-five papers were included in the review. Studies were performed around the world, with samples of up to 171 (median n = 15) representing individuals with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, older adults, and the general population. The majority of studies used the Android operating system and an array of smartphone sensors, most frequently capturing accelerometry, location, audio, and usage data. Captured data were usually sent to a remote server for processing but were shared with participants in only 40% of studies. Reported benefits of passive sensing included accurately detecting changes in status, behavior change through feedback, and increased accountability in participants. Studies reported facing technical, methodological, and privacy challenges. Studies in the nascent area of smartphone-based passive sensing for health and wellbeing demonstrate promise and invite continued research and investment. Existing studies suffer from weaknesses in research design, lack of feedback and clinical integration, and inadequate attention to privacy issues. Key recommendations relate to developing passive sensing strategies matching the problem at hand, using personalized interventions, and addressing methodological and privacy challenges. As evolving passive sensing technology presents new possibilities for health and wellbeing, additional research must address methodological, clinical integration, and privacy issues. Doing so depends on interdisciplinary collaboration between informatics and clinical experts.

AB  - Background/aims: The idea that champions are crucial to effective healthcare-related implementation has gained broad acceptance; yet the champion construct has been hampered by inconsistent use across the published literature. This integrative review sought to establish the current state of the literature on champions in healthcare settings and bring greater clarity to this important construct. Methods: This integrative review was limited to research articles in peer-reviewed, English-language journals published from 1980 to 2016. Searches were conducted on the online MEDLINE database via OVID and PubMed using the keyword “champion.” Several additional terms often describe champions and were also included as keywords: implementation leader, opinion leader, facilitator, and change agent. Bibliographies of full-text articles that met inclusion criteria were reviewed for additional references not yet identified via the main strategy of conducting keyword searches in MEDLINE. A five-member team abstracted all full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria. Results: The final dataset for the integrative review consisted of 199 unique articles. Use of the term champion varied widely across the articles with respect to topic, specific job positions, or broader organizational roles. The most common method for operationalizing champion for purposes of analysis was the use of a dichotomous variable designating champion presence or absence. Four studies randomly allocated of the presence or absence of champions. Conclusions: The number of published champion-related articles has markedly increased: more articles were published during the last two years of this review (i.e. 2015–2016) than during its first 30 years (i.e. 1980–2009). The number of champion-related articles has continued to increase sharply since the year 2000. Individual studies consistently found that champions were important positive influences on implementation effectiveness. Although few in number, the randomized trials of champions that have been conducted demonstrate the feasibility of using experimental design to study the effects of champions in healthcare.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Although strain on hospital capacity has been associated with increased mortality in nonpandemic settings, studies are needed to examine the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) critical care capacity and mortality. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine whether COVID-19 mortality was associated with COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) strain. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study was conducted among veterans with COVID-19, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing in the laboratory from March through August 2020, cared for at any Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital with 10 or more patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The follow-up period was through November 2020. Data were analyzed from March to November 2020. <h3>Exposures</h3> Receiving treatment for COVID-19 in the ICU during a period of increased COVID-19 ICU load, with load defined as mean number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU during the patient’s hospital stay divided by the number of ICU beds at that facility, or increased COVID-19 ICU demand, with demand defined as mean number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU during the patient’s stay divided by the maximum number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> All-cause mortality was recorded through 30 days after discharge from the hospital. <h3>Results</h3> Among 8516 patients with COVID-19 admitted to 88 VA hospitals, 8014 (94.1%) were men and mean (SD) age was 67.9 (14.2) years. Mortality varied over time, with 218 of 954 patients (22.9%) dying in March, 399 of 1594 patients (25.0%) dying in April, 143 of 920 patients (15.5%) dying in May, 179 of 1314 patients (13.6%) dying in June, 297 of 2373 patients (12.5%) dying in July, and 174 of 1361 (12.8%) patients dying in August (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Patients with COVID-19 who were treated in the ICU during periods of increased COVID-19 ICU demand had increased risk of mortality compared with patients treated during periods of low COVID-19 ICU demand (ie, demand of ≤25%); the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.81-1.22;<i>P</i> = .93) for patients treated when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 25% to 50%, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95-1.48;<i>P</i> = .13) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 50% to 75%, and 1.94 (95% CI, 1.46-2.59;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 75% to 100%. No association between COVID-19 ICU demand and mortality was observed for patients with COVID-19 not in the ICU. The association between COVID-19 ICU load and mortality was not consistent over time (ie, early vs late in the pandemic). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This cohort study found that although facilities augmented ICU capacity during the pandemic, strains on critical care capacity were associated with increased COVID-19 ICU mortality. Tracking COVID-19 ICU demand may be useful to hospital administrators and health officials as they coordinate COVID-19 admissions across hospitals to optimize outcomes for patients with this illness.

AB  - As interest in autism in adulthood grows, so does the need for methods to promote the inclusion of autistic adults in research. Our objective was to create practice-based guidelines for the inclusion of autistic adults, both as research team members and as study participants. We conducted an institutional ethnography of three closely related research partnerships that used participatory methods with autistic adults over the years 2006-2018. We used an iterative approach which combined discussions with community and academic partners and artifact review. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as co-researchers focus on being transparent about partnership goals, clearly defining roles and choosing partners, creating processes for effective communication and power-sharing, building and maintaining trust, disseminating findings, encouraging community capacitation, and fairly compensating partners. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as study participants focus on maximizing autonomy and inclusion, creating an accessible consent process, offering multiple modes of participation, adapting survey instruments for use with autistic adults, creating accessible qualitative interview guides, and handling data from proxy reporters. Although these practice-based guidelines may not apply to all research teams, we hope that other researchers can capitalize on these practical lessons when including autistic adults in research.

AB  - Background: After critical illness, new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, and/or mental health function are common among patients who have survived. Who should be screened for long-term impairments, what tools to use, and when remain unclear. Objectives: Provide pragmatic recommendations to clinicians caring for adult survivors of critical illness related to screening for postdischarge impairments. Participants: Thirty-one international experts in risk-stratification and assessment of survivors of critical illness, including practitioners involved in the Society of Critical Care Medicine’s Thrive Post-ICU Collaboratives, survivors of critical illness, and clinical researchers. Design: Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus conference on post-intensive care syndrome prediction and assessment, held in Dallas, in May 2019. A systematic search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library was conducted in 2018 and updated in 2019 to complete an original systematic review and to identify pre-existing systematic reviews. Meeting Outcomes: We concluded that existing tools are insufficient to reliably predict post-intensive care syndrome. We identified factors before (e.g., frailty, preexisting functional impairments), during (e.g., duration of delirium, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome), and after (e.g., early symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder) critical illness that can be used to identify patients at high-risk for cognitive, mental health, and physical impairments after critical illness in whom screening is recommended. We recommend serial assessments, beginning within 2–4 weeks of hospital discharge, using the following screening tools: Montreal Cognitive Assessment test; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Impact of Event Scale-Revised (post-traumatic stress disorder); 6-minute walk; and/or the EuroQol-5D-5L, a health-related quality of life measure (physical function). Conclusions: Beginning with an assessment of a patient’s pre-ICU functional abilities at ICU admission, clinicians have a care coordination strategy to identify and manage impairments across the continuum. As hospital discharge approaches, clinicians should use brief, standardized assessments and compare these results to patient’s pre-ICU functional abilities (“functional reconciliation”). We recommend serial assessments for post-intensive care syndrome-related problems continue within 2–4 weeks of hospital discharge, be prioritized among high-risk patients, using the identified screening tools to prompt referrals for services and/or more detailed assessments.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Observational studies demonstrate links between patient-centered communication, quality of life (QOL), and aggressive treatments in advanced cancer, yet few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of communication interventions have been reported. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine whether a combined intervention involving oncologists, patients with advanced cancer, and caregivers would promote patient-centered communication, and to estimate intervention effects on shared understanding, patient-physician relationships, QOL, and aggressive treatments in the last 30 days of life. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Cluster RCT at community- and hospital-based cancer clinics in Western New York and Northern California; 38 medical oncologists (mean age 44.6 years; 11 (29%) female) and 265 community-dwelling adult patients with advanced nonhematologic cancer participated (mean age, 64.4 years, 146 [55.0%] female, 235 [89%] white; enrolled August 2012 to June 2014; followed for 3 years); 194 patients had participating caregivers. <h3>Interventions</h3> Oncologists received individualized communication training using standardized patient instructors while patients received question prompt lists and individualized communication coaching to identify issues to address during an upcoming oncologist visit. Both interventions focused on<i>engaging</i>patients in consultations,<i>responding</i>to emotions,<i>informing</i>patients about prognosis and treatment choices, and<i>balanced framing</i>of information. Control participants received no training. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The prespecified primary outcome was a composite measure of patient-centered communication coded from audio recordings of the first oncologist visit following patient coaching (intervention group) or enrollment (control). Secondary outcomes included the patient-physician relationship, shared understanding of prognosis, QOL, and aggressive treatments and hospice use in the last 30 days of life. <h3>Results</h3> Data from 38 oncologists (19 randomized to intervention) and 265 patients (130 intervention) were analyzed. In fully adjusted models, the intervention resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in the primary physician-patient communication end point (adjusted intervention effect, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06-0.62;<i>P</i> = .02). Differences in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> A combined intervention that included oncologist communication training and coaching for patients with advanced cancer was effective in improving patient-centered communication but did not affect secondary outcomes. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01485627

AB  - Over the last 5 years, stimulated by the changing healthcare environment and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Meaningful Use (MU) Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive program, EHR adoption has increased remarkably, and there is early evidence that such adoption has resulted in healthcare safety and quality benefits.1,2 However, with this broad adoption, many clinicians are voicing concerns that EHR use has had unintended clinical consequences, including reduced time for patient-clinician interaction,3 new and burdensome data entry tasks being transferred to front-line clinicians,4,5 and lengthened clinician workdays.6–8 Additionally, interoperability between different EHR systems has languished despite large efforts towards that goal.9,10 These challenges are contributing to physicians’ decreased satisfaction with their work lives.11–13 In professional journals,14 press reports,15–17 on wards, and in clinics, we have heard of the difficulties that the transition from paper records to EHRs has created.18 As a result, clinicians are seeking help to get through their work days, which often extend into evenings devoted to writing notes. Examples of comments we have received from clinicians and patients include: “Computers always make things faster and cheaper. Not this time,” and “My doctor pays more attention to the computer than to me.”

Ultimately the healthcare system's goal is to create a robust, integrated, and interoperable healthcare system that includes patients, physician practices, public health, population management, and support for clinical and basic sciences research. This ecosystem has been referred to as the “learning health system.”19 EHRs are an important part of the learning health system, along with many other clinical systems, but future ways in which information is transformed into knowledge will likely require all parts of the system working together. Potentially every patient encounter could present an …

AB  - This paper reviews state-of-the-art research solutions across the spectrum of medical imaging informatics, discusses clinical translation, and provides future directions for advancing clinical practice. More specifically, it summarizes advances in medical imaging acquisition technologies for different modalities, highlighting the necessity for efficient medical data management strategies in the context of AI in big healthcare data analytics. It then provides a synopsis of contemporary and emerging algorithmic methods for disease classification and organ/ tissue segmentation, focusing on AI and deep learning architectures that have already become the de facto approach. The clinical benefits of in-silico modelling advances linked with evolving 3D reconstruction and visualization applications are further documented. Concluding, integrative analytics approaches driven by associate research branches highlighted in this study promise to revolutionize imaging informatics as known today across the healthcare continuum for both radiology and digital pathology applications. The latter, is projected to enable informed, more accurate diagnosis, timely prognosis, and effective treatment planning, underpinning precision medicine.

AB  - According to a landmark study by the Institute of Medicine, patients with cancer often receive poorly coordinated care in multiple settings from many providers. Lack of coordination is associated with poor symptom control, medical errors, and higher costs.The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to (1) synthesize the findings of studies addressing cancer care coordination, (2) describe study outcomes across the cancer continuum, and (3) obtain a quantitative estimate of the effect of interventions in cancer care coordination on service system processes and patient health outcomes.Of 1241 abstracts identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. Each study had US or Canadian participants, comparison or control groups, measures, times, samples, and/or interventions. Two researchers independently applied a standardized search strategy, coding scheme, and online coding program to each study. Eleven studies met the additional criteria for the meta-analysis; a random effects estimation model was used for data analysis.Cancer care coordination approaches led to improvements in 81 % of outcomes, including screening, measures of patient experience with care, and quality of end-of-life care. Across the continuum of cancer care, patient navigation was the most frequent care coordination intervention, followed by home telehealth; nurse case management was third in frequency. The meta-analysis of a subset of the reviewed studies showed that the odds of appropriate health care utilization in cancer care coordination interventions were almost twice (OR = 1.9, 95 % CI = 1.5-3.5) that of comparison interventions.This review offers promising findings on the impact of cancer care coordination on increasing value and reducing healthcare costs in the USA.

AB  - To determine the psychometric properties of the Mentoring Competency Assessment (MCA), a 26-item skills inventory that enables research mentors and mentees to evaluate six competencies of mentors: maintaining effective communication, aligning expectations, assessing understanding, addressing diversity, fostering independence, and promoting professional development.In 2010, investigators administered the MCA to 283 mentor-mentee pairs from 16 universities participating in a trial of a mentoring curriculum for clinical and translational research mentors. The authors analyzed baseline MCA data to describe the instrument's psychometric properties.Coefficient alpha scores for the MCA showed reliability (internal consistency). The hypothesized model with its six latent constructs (competencies) resulted in an acceptable fit to the data. For the instrument completed by mentors, chi-square = 663.20; df = 284; P < .001; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.069 (90% CI, 0.062-0.076); comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.85; and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.83. For the instrument completed by mentees, chi-square = 840.62; df = 284; P < .001; RMSEA = 0.080 (90% CI, 0.063-0.077); CFI = 0.87; and TLI = 0.85. The correlations among the six competencies were high: 0.49-0.87 for mentors, 0.58-0.92 for mentees. All parameter estimates for the individual items were significant; standardized factor loadings ranged from 0.32 to 0.81 for mentors and 0.56 to 0.86 for mentees.The findings demonstrate that the MCA has reliability and validity. In addition, this study provides preliminary norms derived from a national sample of mentors and mentees.

AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal pain is among the most prevalent, costly, and disabling medical disorders. However, few clinical trials have examined interventions to improve chronic pain in primary care.To determine the effectiveness of a telecare intervention for chronic pain.The Stepped Care to Optimize Pain Care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study was a randomized trial comparing a telephone-delivered collaborative care management intervention vs usual care in 250 patients with chronic (≥3 months) musculoskeletal pain of at least moderate intensity (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] score ≥5). Patients were enrolled from 5 primary care clinics in a single Veterans Affairs medical center from June 2010 through May 2012, with 12-month follow-up completed by June 2013.Patients were randomized either to an intervention group (n = 124) or to a usual care group whose members received all pain care as usual from their primary care physicians (n = 126). The intervention group received 12 months of telecare management that coupled automated symptom monitoring with an algorithm-guided stepped care approach to optimizing analgesics.Primary outcome was the BPI total score, which ranges from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("pain as bad as you can imagine") and for which a 1-point change is considered clinically important. Secondary pain outcomes included BPI interference and severity, global pain improvement, treatment satisfaction, and use of opioids and other analgesics.Overall, mean (SD) baseline BPI scores in the intervention and control groups were 5.31 (1.81) and 5.12 (1.80), respectively. Compared with usual care, the intervention group had a 1.02-point lower (95% CI, -1.58 to -0.47) BPI score at 12 months (3.57 vs 4.59). Patients in the intervention group were nearly twice as likely to report at least a 30% improvement in their pain score by 12 months (51.7% vs 27.1%; relative risk, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4 to 2.7]), with a number needed to treat of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.0 to 6.4) for a 30% improvement. Secondary pain outcomes also improved. Few patients in either group required opioid initiation or dose escalation.Telecare collaborative management increased the proportion of primary care patients with improved chronic musculoskeletal pain. This was accomplished by optimizing nonopioid analgesic medications using a stepped care algorithm and monitoring.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00926588.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To establish preferred strategies for presenting drug-drug interaction (DDI) clinical decision support alerts. Materials and Methods: A DDI Clinical Decision Support Conference Series included a workgroup consisting of 24 clinical, usability, and informatics experts representing academia, health information technology (IT) vendors, healthcare organizations, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT. Workgroup members met via web-based meetings 12 times from January 2013 to February 2014, and two in-person meetings to reach consensus on recommendations to improve decision support for DDIs. We addressed three key questions: (1) what, how, where, and when do we display DDI decision support? (2) should presentation of DDI decision support vary by clinicians? and (3) how should effectiveness of DDI decision support be measured? Results: Our recommendations include the consistent use of terminology, visual cues, minimal text, formatting, content, and reporting standards to facilitate usability. All clinicians involved in the medication use process should be able to view DDI alerts and actions by other clinicians. Override rates are common but may not be a good measure of effectiveness. Discussion: Seven core elements should be included with DDI decision support. DDI information should be presented to all clinicians. Finally, in their current form, override rates have limited capability to evaluate alert effectiveness. Conclusion: DDI clinical decision support alerts need major improvements. We provide recommendations for healthcare organizations and IT vendors to improve the clinician interface of DDI alerts, with the aim of reducing alert fatigue and improving patient safety.

AB  - This National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pathways to Prevention Workshop was cosponsored by the NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), the NIH Pain Consortium, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. A multidisciplinary working group developed the workshop agenda, and an evidence-based practice center prepared an evidence report through a contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to facilitate the workshop discussion. During the 1.5-day workshop, invited experts discussed the body of evidence, and attendees had opportunities to provide comments during open discussion periods. After weighing evidence from the evidence report, expert presentations, and public comments, an unbiased, independent panel prepared a draft report that identified research gaps and future research priorities. The report was posted on the ODP Web site for 2 weeks for public comment. This article is an abridged version of the panel's full report, which is available at https://prevention.nih.gov/programs-events/pathways-to-prevention/workshops/opioids-chronic-pain/workshop-resources#final report.

AB  - Mental disorders account for 25% of all health-related disability worldwide. More patients receive treatment for mental disorders in the primary care sector than in the mental health specialty setting. However, brief visits, inadequate reimbursement, deficits in primary care provider (PCP) training, and competing demands often limit the capacity of the PCP to produce optimal outcomes in patients with common mental disorders. More than 80 randomized trials have shown the benefits of collaborative care (CC) models for improving outcomes of patients with depression and anxiety. Six key components of CC include a population-based approach, measurement-based care, treatment to target strategy, care management, supervision by a mental health professional (MHP), and brief psychological therapies. Multiple trials have also shown that CC for depression is equally or more cost-effective than many of the current treatments for medical disorders. Factors that may facilitate the implementation of CC include a more favorable alignment of medical and mental health services in accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes; greater use of telecare as well as automated outcome monitoring; identification of patients who might benefit most from CC; and systematic training of both PCPs and MHPs in integrated team-based care.

AB  - Anxiety and chronic pain are prevalent and frequently co-occur. Our purpose was to examine the association between anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and functional impairment in primary care patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Data were drawn from baseline interviews of the 250 primary care patients enrolled in the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness trial. Validated measures were used to determine the proportion of patients screening positive for five common anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety, posttraumatic stress and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Bivariate analyses examined associations between the type and number of anxiety disorders for which patients screened positive and representative pain, psychological and other HRQL outcomes. Multivariable models controlling for major depression and other covariates examined the association between the number of screen-positive anxiety conditions and functional impairment in psychological [SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) score], pain [Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference score] and work (disability days) domains. One hundred fourteen (45%) patients screened positive for at least one anxiety disorder and, compared to the 136 screen-negative patients, had significantly worse scores across multiple pain, psychological and other HRQL domains. Substantial impairment was seen for each of the five screen-positive anxiety conditions and progressively worsened as the number of conditions increased from one (n= 54) to two (n= 26) to ≥ 3 (n= 34). The number of screen-positive anxiety conditions was strongly associated (P< .0001) with worse BPI interference and MCS scores and more disability days in models adjusting for age, sex and medical comorbidity. After further adjusting for major depression, associations were attenuated but remained significant for BPI interference (P< .0001) and MCS (P= .018) and marginally significant for disability days (P= .062). Nearly half of primary care patients with chronic pain screen positive for one or more anxiety disorders, which in turn are adversely associated with impairment across multiple domains of HRQL. Detecting and treating anxiety may be an important component of pain management.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Hospitalized older adults often lack decisional capacity, but outside of the intensive care unit and end-of-life care settings, little is known about the frequency of decision making by family members or other surrogates or its implications for hospital care. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe the scope of surrogate decision making, the hospital course, and outcomes for older adults. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Prospective, observational study conducted in medicine and medical intensive care unit services of 2 hospitals in 1 Midwestern city in 1083 hospitalized older adults identified by their physicians as requiring major medical decisions. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Clinical characteristics, hospital outcomes, nature of major medical decisions, and surrogate involvement. <h3>Results</h3> According to physician reports, at 48 hours of hospitalization, 47.4% (95% CI, 44.4%-50.4%) of older adults required at least some surrogate involvement, including 23.0% (20.6%-25.6%) with all decisions made by a surrogate. Among patients who required a surrogate for at least 1 decision within 48 hours, 57.2% required decisions about life-sustaining care (mostly addressing code status), 48.6% about procedures and operations, and 46.9% about discharge planning. Patients who needed a surrogate experienced a more complex hospital course with greater use of ventilators (2.5% of patients who made decisions and 13.2% of patients who required any surrogate decisions;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), artificial nutrition (1.7% of patients and 14.4% of surrogates;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and length of stay (median, 6 days for patients and 7 days for surrogates;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). They were more likely to be discharged to an extended-care facility (21.2% with patient decisions and 40.9% with surrogate decisions;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and had higher hospital mortality (0.0% patients and 5.9% surrogates;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Most surrogates were daughters (58.9%), sons (25.0%), or spouses (20.6%). Overall, only 7.4% had a living will and 25.0% had a health care representative document in the medical record. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Surrogate decision making occurs for nearly half of hospitalized older adults and includes both complete decision making by the surrogate and joint decision making by the patient and surrogate. Surrogates commonly face a broad range of decisions in the intensive care unit and the hospital ward setting. Hospital functions should be redesigned to account for the large and growing role of surrogates, supporting them as they make health care decisions.

AB  - Article AbstractObjective: To assess recent national trends in mental health care provided by office-based psychiatrists and primary care physicians. Method: Trends in mental health-related visits to psychiatrists and primary care physicians are evaluated with the 1995-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys. Rates and percentages of visits with mental health complaints, mental disorder diagnoses, psychotropic medications, and psychotherapy or mental health counseling were calculated for 1995-1998, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010 by dividing the number of visits of a given type by intercensal population estimates. Results: Between 1995-1998 and 2007-2010, a significant increase occurred in the rate per 100 population of primary care visits with mental health complaints (5.96 to 8.49) (OR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.62, mental disorders (8.75 to 13.23) (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.26-1.56), and psychotropic medications (11.08 to 26.74) (OR=3.43; 95% CI, 2.16-2.71). Significant corresponding increases occurred in psychiatrist visits with psychotropic medications (5.28 to 7.85) (OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.49-3.41), but not mental disorders (7.60 to 8.95) (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34-2.23), and the rate with mental health complaints significantly declined (5.87 to 5.20) (OR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.62). During this period, the percentages of visits to primary care physicians that included prescriptions for antidepressants (interaction P = .0001), antipsychotics (interaction P = .03), and anxiolytics/hypnotics (interaction P = .0009) increased significantly faster than the corresponding percentages of visits to psychiatrists. A similar pattern occurred for visits that resulted in a bipolar disorder diagnosis (interaction P = .01). Conclusions: In recent years, office-based primary care physicians have significantly increased their involvement in providing mental health care. These trends underscore the importance of collaboration between primary care physicians and psychiatrists to help ensure provision of high quality outpatient mental health care.

AB  - To develop and validate a new self-report questionnaire for the assessment of the psychological features of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition somatic symptom disorder.The Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12) was developed in several steps from an initial pool of 98 items. The SSD-12 is composed of 12 items; each of the three psychological subcriteria is measured by four items. In a cross-sectional study, the SSD-12 was administered to 698 patients (65.8% female, mean [standard deviation] age = 38.79 [14.15] years) from a psychosomatic outpatient clinic. Item and scale characteristics as well as measures of reliability and validity were determined.The SSD-12 has good item characteristics and excellent reliability (Cronbach α = .95). Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that a three-factorial structure that reflects the three psychological criteria interpreted as cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects (n = 663, Comparative Fit Index > 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index > 0.99, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.06, 90% confidence interval = 0.01-0.08). SSD-12 total sum score was significantly associated with somatic symptom burden (r = 0.47, p < .001) and health anxiety (r = 0.71, p < .001), and moderately associated with general anxiety (r = 0.35, p < .001) and depressive symptoms (r = 0.22, p < .001). Patients with a higher SSD-12 psychological symptom burden reported higher general physical and mental health impairment and significantly higher health care use.The SSD-12 is the first self-report questionnaire that operationalizes the new psychological characteristics of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition somatic symptom disorder. Initial assessment indicates that the SSD-12 has sufficient reliability and validity to warrant further testing in both research and clinical settings.

AB  - Objectives: Delirium severity is independently associated with longer hospital stays, nursing home placement, and death in patients outside the ICU. Delirium severity in the ICU is not routinely measured because the available instruments are difficult to complete in critically ill patients. We designed our study to assess the reliability and validity of a new ICU delirium severity tool, the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 delirium severity scale. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Medical, surgical, and progressive ICUs of three academic hospitals. Patients: Five hundred eighteen adult (≥ 18 yr) patients. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients received the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, and Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 assessments. A 7-point scale (0–7) was derived from responses to the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale items. Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 showed high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.85) and good correlation with Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 scores (correlation coefficient = 0.64). Known-groups validity was supported by the separation of mechanically ventilated and nonventilated assessments. Median Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 scores demonstrated good predictive validity with higher odds (odds ratio = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.30–1.66) of in-hospital mortality and lower odds (odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.72–0.9) of being discharged home after adjusting for age, race, gender, severity of illness, and chronic comorbidities. Higher Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 scores were also associated with increased length of ICU stay ( p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 is a valid and reliable delirium severity measure among ICU patients. Further research comparing it to other delirium severity measures, its use in delirium efficacy trials, and real-life implementation is needed to determine its role in research and clinical practice.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of cognitive impairment among the older adult population warrants attention to the identification of practices that may minimize the progression of early forms of cognitive impairment, including the transitional stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to permanent stages of dementia. This article identifies both markers of disease progress and risk factors linked to the progression of MCI to dementia. Potentially modifiable risk factors may offer researchers a point of intervention to modify the effect of the risk factor and to minimize the future burden of dementia.

The PROMIS pain interference scales were validated across diverse samples; however, more information about their MIDs could improve their interpretability. The purpose of this study was to estimate MIDs for 4 fixed-length PROMIS pain interference scales, including the 6-item Pain Short Form and the 4-, 6-, and 8-item pain interference scales used in the PROMIS profile instruments. Data were analyzed from 3 randomized controlled trials (N = 759). The 3 samples, respectively, consisted of patients with chronic low back pain (n = 261), chronic back pain or hip/knee osteoarthritis pain (n = 240), and a history of stroke (n = 258). For each sample, anchor- and distribution-based approaches were used to estimate MIDs. Standard error of measurement and effect sizes were used as distribution-based MID estimates. Anchor-based MID estimates were established by mapping PROMIS pain interference scores onto established anchor measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory, and retrospective and prospective global ratings of change. The distribution- and anchor-based MID estimates showed convergence. For the pain samples, MID estimates ranged from 2 to 3 T-score points. For the nonpain sample, MID estimates ranged from 3.5 to 4.5 T-score points. The MID estimates were comparable across the 4 fixed-length scales. These MIDs can be used to evaluate treatment effects in research and clinical care and to calculate estimates for powering clinical trials.

AB  - Improved cancer prognosis is a central goal for precision health medicine. Though many models can predict differential survival from data, there is a strong need for sophisticated algorithms that can aggregate and filter relevant predictors from increasingly complex data inputs. In turn, these models should provide deeper insight into which types of data are most relevant to improve prognosis. Deep Learning-based neural networks offer a potential solution for both problems because they are highly flexible and account for data complexity in a non-linear fashion. In this study, we implement Deep Learning-based networks to determine how gene expression data predicts Cox regression survival in breast cancer. We accomplish this through an algorithm called SALMON (Survival Analysis Learning with Multi-Omics Neural Networks), which aggregates and simplifies gene expression data and cancer biomarkers to enable prognosis prediction. The results revealed improved performance when more omics data were used in model construction. Rather than use raw gene expression values as model inputs, we innovatively use eigengene modules from the result of gene co-expression network analysis. The corresponding high impact co-expression modules and other omics data are identified by feature selection technique, then examined by conducting enrichment analysis and exploiting biological functions, escalated the interpretation of input feature from gene level to co-expression modules level. Our study shows the feasibility of discovering breast cancer related co-expression modules, sketch a blueprint of future endeavors on Deep Learning-based survival analysis.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) approaches for non-communicable disease (NCD) care seem particularly applicable to sub-Saharan Africa given the penetration of mobile phones in the region. The evidence to support its implementation has not been critically reviewed. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, a number of other databases, and grey literature for studies reported between 1992 and 2012 published in English or with an English abstract available. We extracted data using a standard form in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Our search yielded 475 citations of which eleven were reviewed in full after applying exclusion criteria. Five of those studies met the inclusion criteria of using a mobile phone for non-communicable disease care in sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies lacked comparator arms, clinical endpoints, or were of short duration. mHealth for NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa appears feasible for follow-up and retention of patients, can support peer support networks, and uses a variety of mHealth modalities. Whether mHealth is associated with any adverse effect has not been systematically studied. Only a small number of mHealth strategies for NCDs have been studied in sub-Saharan Africa. There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of mHealth for NCD care in sub-Saharan Africa. We present a framework for cataloging evidence on mHealth strategies that incorporates health system challenges and stages of NCD care. This framework can guide approaches to fill evidence gaps in this area. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42014007527.

AB  - Although persons with dementia are frequently hospitalized, relatively little is known about the health profile, patterns of health care use, and mortality rates for patients with dementia who access care in the emergency department (ED). We linked data from our hospital system with Medicare and Medicaid claims, Minimum Data Set, and Outcome and Assessment Information Set data to evaluate 175,652 ED visits made by 10,354 individuals with dementia and 15,020 individuals without dementia over 11 years. Survival rates after ED visits and associated charges were examined. Patients with dementia visited the ED more frequently, were hospitalized more often than patients without dementia, and had an increased odds of returning to the ED within 30 days of an index ED visit compared with persons who never had a dementia diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.29; P<0.001). Survival rates differed significantly between patients by dementia status (P<0.001). Mean Medicare payments for ED services were significantly higher among patients with dementia. These results show that older adults with dementia are frequent ED visitors who have greater comorbidity, incur higher charges, are admitted to hospitals at higher rates, return to EDs at higher rates, and have higher mortality after an ED visit than patients without dementia.

AB  - TREM2 encodes for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and has rare, coding variants that associate with risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) in Caucasians of European and North-American origin. This study evaluated the role of TREM2 in LOAD risk in African-American (AA) subjects. We performed exonic sequencing and validation in two independent cohorts of >800 subjects. We selected six coding variants (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.D87N, p.E151K, p.W191X, and p.L211P) for case–control analyses in a total of 906 LOAD cases vs. 2,487 controls. We identified significant LOAD risk association with p.L211P (p = 0.01, OR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.05-1.54) and suggestive association with p.W191X (p = 0.08, OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 0.97-1.87). Conditional analysis suggests that p.L211P, which is in linkage disequilibrium with p.W191X, may be the stronger variant of the two, but does not rule out independent contribution of the latter. TREM2 p.L211P resides within the cytoplasmic domain and p.W191X is a stop-gain mutation within the shorter TREM-2V transcript. The coding variants within the extracellular domain of TREM2 previously shown to confer LOAD risk in Caucasians were extremely rare in our AA cohort and did not associate with LOAD risk. Our findings suggest that TREM2 coding variants also confer LOAD risk in AA, but implicate variants within different regions of the gene than those identified for Caucasian subjects. These results underscore the importance of investigating different ethnic populations for disease risk variant discovery, which may uncover allelic heterogeneity with potentially diverse mechanisms of action.

AB  - Abstract Objective Widespread health information exchange (HIE) is a national objective motivated by the promise of improved care and a reduction in costs. Previous reviews have found little rigorous evidence that HIE positively affects these anticipated benefits. However, early studies of HIE were methodologically limited. The purpose of the current study is to review the recent literature on the impact of HIE. Methods We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct our systematic review. PubMed and Scopus databases were used to identify empirical articles that evaluated HIE in the context of a health care outcome. Results Our search strategy identified 24 articles that included 63 individual analyses. The majority of the studies were from the United States representing 9 states; and about 40% of the included analyses occurred in a handful of HIEs from the state of New York. Seven of the 24 studies used designs suitable for causal inference and all reported some beneficial effect from HIE; none reported adverse effects. Conclusions The current systematic review found that studies with more rigorous designs all reported benefits from HIE. Such benefits include fewer duplicated procedures, reduced imaging, lower costs, and improved patient safety. We also found that studies evaluating community HIEs were more likely to find benefits than studies that evaluated enterprise HIEs or vendor-mediated exchanges. Overall, these finding bode well for the HIEs ability to deliver on anticipated improvements in care delivery and reduction in costs.

AB  - Background: Studies report inconsistent performance of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced adenomas. Purpose: To summarize performance characteristics of FITs for CRC and advanced adenomas in average-risk persons undergoing screening colonoscopy (reference standard) and to identify factors affecting these characteristics. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception through October 2018; reference lists of studies and reviews. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently screened records to identify published English-language prospective or retrospective observational studies that evaluated FIT sensitivity and specificity for colonoscopic findings in asymptomatic, average-risk adults. Data Extraction: Two authors independently extracted data and evaluated study quality. Data Synthesis: Thirty-one studies (120 255 participants; 18 FITs) were included; all were judged to have low to moderate risk of bias. Performance characteristics depended on the threshold for a positive result. A threshold of 10 µg/g resulted in sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.95) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.10 (CI, 0.06 to 0.19) for CRC, whereas a threshold of greater than 20 µg/g resulted in specificity of 0.95 (CI, 0.94 to 0.96) and a positive likelihood ratio of 15.49 (CI, 9.82 to 22.39). For advanced adenomas, sensitivity was 0.40 (CI, 0.33 to 0.47) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.67 (CI, 0.57 to 0.78) at 10 µg/g, and specificity was 0.95 (CI, 0.94 to 0.96) and the positive likelihood ratio was 5.86 (CI, 3.77 to 8.97) at greater than 20 µg/g. Studies had low to high heterogeneity, depending on the threshold. Although several FITs had adequate performance, sensitivity and specificity for CRC for 1 qualitative FIT were 0.90 and 0.91, respectively, at its single threshold of 10 µg/g; positive and negative likelihood ratios were 10.13 and 0.11, respectively. Comparison of 3 FITs at 3 thresholds was inconclusive: CIs overlapped, and the comparisons were across rather than within studies. Limitations: Only English-language studies were included. Incomplete reporting limited quality assessment of some evidence. Performance characteristics are for 1-time rather than serial testing. Conclusion: Single-application FITs have moderate to high sensitivity and specificity for CRC, depending on the positivity threshold. Sensitivity of 1-time testing for advanced adenomas is low, regardless of the threshold. Primary Funding Source: Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine.

AB  - Improving patient engagement in HIV care is critical for maximizing the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a systematic review of studies that used HIV-positive peers to bolster linkage, retention, and/or adherence to ART. We searched articles published and indexed in Pubmed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL between 1996 and 2014. Peers were required to be HIV-positive. Studies were restricted to those published in English. Nine studies with n = 4658 participants met the inclusion criteria. Peer-based interventions were predominantly focused on improving adherence to ART, or evaluations of retention and adherence via viral suppression. Five (56 %) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall findings were mixed on the impact of peers on ART adherence, viral suppression, and mortality. While positive effects of peer interventions on improving linkage and retention were found, there were limited studies assessing these outcomes. Additional research is warranted to demonstrate the impact of peers on linkage and retention in diverse populations.

AB  - Background ICU admissions are ever increasing across the United States. Following critical illness, physical functioning (PF) may be impaired for up to 5 years. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions targeting PF among ICU survivors. The objective of this study was to identify effective interventions that improve long-term PF in ICU survivors. Methods MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Physiotherapy Evidence-Based Database (PEDro) were searched between 1990 and 2012. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for eligibility, critically appraised the included studies, and extracted data into standardized evidence tables. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included exercise/physical therapy (PT), parenteral nutrition, nurse-led follow-up, spontaneous awakening trials, absence of sedation during mechanical ventilation, and early tracheotomy. Nine studies failed to demonstrate efficacy on PF of the ICU survivors. However, early physical exercise and PT-based interventions had a positive effect on long-term PF. Conclusions The only effective intervention to improve long-term PF in critically ill patients is exercise/PT; its benefit may be greater if started earlier. Further research in this area comparing different interventions and timing is needed. ICU admissions are ever increasing across the United States.

AB  - Objectives To plan for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID‐19) vaccine distribution, the Indiana Department of Health surveyed nursing home and assisted living facility staff. Design Cross‐sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. Setting and Participants Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. Measures Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long‐term care, and geographic location of facility were self‐reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. Results There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID‐19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%). Characteristics associated with increased willingness were age over 60, male, and white race ( P &lt; .0001). No statistically significant differences were observed among staff self‐reporting prior SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Conclusions and Implications The willingness to receive the COVID‐19 vaccine immediately or in the future may be as high as 69%, but varies among subgroups of nursing home staff which has implications for distribution. Educating staff on the vaccine may be critical for increasing uptake. Widespread vaccination holds the promise of protection against serious illness and death and a return of visitors and activities that support improved quality of life. This promise will not be realized without strong uptake of the vaccines.

AB  - Abstract Objective Cancer‐related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common, persistent, and disabling symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. Evidence‐based treatments that are acceptable to patients are critically needed. This study examined the efficacy of mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) for CRF and related symptoms. Method A sample of 35 cancer survivors with clinically significant CRF was randomly assigned to a 7‐week MBSR‐based intervention or wait‐list control group. The intervention group received training in mindfulness meditation, yoga, and self‐regulatory responses to stress. Fatigue interference (primary outcome) and a variety of secondary outcomes (e.g., fatigue severity, vitality, disability, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance) were assessed at baseline, post‐intervention, and 1‐month follow‐up. Bonferroni correction was employed to account for multiple comparisons. Controls received the intervention after the 1‐month follow‐up. Participants in both groups were followed for 6 months after completing their respective MBSR courses to assess maintenance of effects. Results Compared to controls, the MBSR group reported large post‐intervention reductions as assessed by effect sizes ( d ) in the primary outcome, fatigue interference ( d = −1.43, p &lt; 0.001), along with fatigue severity ( d = −1.55, p &lt; 0.001), vitality ( d = 1.29, p &lt; 0.001), depression ( d = −1.30, p &lt; 0.001), and sleep disturbance ( d = −0.74, p = 0.001). Results were maintained or strengthened at 1‐month follow‐up, the point at which significant improvements in disability ( d = −1.22, p &lt; 0.002) and anxiety ( d = −0.98, p = 0.002) occurred. Improvements in all outcomes were maintained 6 months after completing the course. MBSR adherence was high, with 90% attendance across groups and high rates of participant‐reported home practice of mindfulness.

AB  - To discuss recent developments in clinical terminologies. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) is the world's largest clinical terminology, developed by an international consortium. LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes) is an international terminology widely used for clinical and laboratory observations. RxNorm is the standard drug terminology in the U.S. We present a brief review of the history, current state, and future development of SNOMED CT, LOINC and RxNorm. We also analyze their similarities and differences, and outline areas for greater interoperability among them. With different starting points, representation formalisms, funding sources, and evolutionary paths, SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm have evolved over the past few decades into three major clinical terminologies supporting key use cases in clinical practice. Despite their differences, partnerships have been created among their development teams to facilitate interoperability and minimize duplication of effort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To understand the professional and psychosocial factors that influence physician antibiotic prescribing habits in the inpatient setting. DESIGN We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 inpatient physicians. Interviews consisted of open-ended questions and flexible probes based on participant responses. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, de-identified, and reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Data were analyzed using emergent thematic analysis. SETTING Two teaching hospitals in Indianapolis, Indiana PARTICIPANTS A total of 30 inpatient physicians (10 physicians-in-training, 20 supervising staff) were enrolled in this study. RESULTS Participants recognized that antibiotics are overused, and many admitted to prescribing antibiotics even when the clinical evidence of infection was uncertain. Overprescription was largely driven by anxiety about missing an infection, whereas potential adverse effects of antibiotics did not strongly influence decision making. Participants did not routinely disclose potential adverse effects of antibiotics to inpatients. Physicians-in-training were strongly influenced by the antibiotic prescribing behavior of their supervising staff physicians. Participants sometimes questioned their colleagues’ antibiotic prescribing decisions, but they frequently avoided providing direct feedback or critique. These physicians cited obstacles of hierarchy, infrequent face-to-face encounters, and the awkwardness of these conversations. CONCLUSION A physician-based culture of prescribing antibiotics involves overusing antibiotics and not challenging the decisions of colleagues. The potential adverse effects of antibiotics did not strongly influence decision making in this sample. A better understanding of these factors could be leveraged in future efforts to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in the inpatient setting. Infect. Control Hosp.

AB  - Survivorship care plans (SCPs), including a treatment summary and follow-up plan, intend to promote coordination of posttreatment cancer care; yet, little is known about the provision of these documents by oncologists to primary care physicians (PCPs). This study compared self-reported oncologist provision and PCP receipt of treatment summaries and follow-up plans, characterized oncologists who reported consistent provision of these documents to PCPs, and examined associations between PCP receipt of these documents and survivorship care.A nationally representative sample of medical oncologists (n = 1130) and PCPs (n = 1020) were surveyed regarding follow-up care for breast and colon cancer survivors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Multivariable regression models identified factors associated with oncologist provision of treatment summaries and SCPs to PCPs (always/almost always vs less frequent).Nearly half of oncologists reported always/almost always providing treatment summaries, whereas 20.2% reported always/almost always providing SCPs (treatment summary + follow-up plan). Approximately one-third of PCPs indicated always/almost always receiving treatment summaries; 13.4% reported always/almost always receiving SCPs. Oncologists who reported training in late- and long-term effects of cancer and use of electronic medical records were more likely to report SCP provision (P < .05). PCP receipt of SCPs was associated with better PCP-reported care coordination, physician-physician communication, and confidence in survivorship care knowledge compared to receipt of neither treatment summaries nor SCPs (P < .05).Providing SCPs to PCPs may enhance survivorship care coordination, physician-physician communication, and PCP confidence. However, considerable progress will be necessary to achieve implementation of sharing SCPs among oncologists and PCPs.

AB  - Cognitive training improves cognitive performance and delays functional impairment, but its effects on dementia are not known. We examined whether three different types of cognitive training lowered the risk of dementia across 10 years of follow-up relative to control and if greater number of training sessions attended was associated with lower dementia risk.The Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (NCT00298558) study was a randomized controlled trial (N = 2802) among initially healthy older adults, which examined the efficacy of three cognitive training programs (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) relative to a no-contact control condition. Up to 10 training sessions were delivered over 6 weeks with up to four sessions of booster training delivered at 11 months and a second set of up to four booster sessions at 35 months. Outcome assessments were taken immediately after intervention and at intervals over 10 years. Dementia was defined using a combination of interview- and performance-based methods.A total of 260 cases of dementia were identified during the follow-up. Speed training resulted in reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.998, P = .049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training did not (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.11, P = .177 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.10, P = .163, respectively). Each additional speed training session was associated with a 10% lower hazard for dementia (unadjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95, P < .001).Initially, healthy older adults randomized to speed of processing cognitive training had a 29% reduction in their risk of dementia after 10 years of follow-up compared to the untreated control group.

AB  - Although racial disparities in pain care are widely reported, much remains to be known about the role of provider and contextual factors. We used computer-simulated patients to examine the influence of patient race, provider racial bias, and clinical ambiguity on pain decisions. One hundred twenty-nine medical residents/fellows made assessment (pain intensity) and treatment (opioid and nonopioid analgesics) decisions for 12 virtual patients with acute pain. Race (black/white) and clinical ambiguity (high/low) were manipulated across vignettes. Participants completed the Implicit Association Test and feeling thermometers, which assess implicit and explicit racial biases, respectively. Individual- and group-level analyses indicated that race and ambiguity had an interactive effect on providers' decisions, such that decisions varied as a function of ambiguity for white but not for black patients. Individual differences across providers were observed for the effect of race and ambiguity on decisions; however, providers' implicit and explicit biases did not account for this variability. These data highlight the complexity of racial disparities and suggest that differences in care between white and black patients are, in part, attributable to the nature (ie, ambiguity) of the clinical scenario. The current study suggests that interventions to reduce disparities should differentially target patient, provider, and contextual factors.PerspectiveThis study examined the unique and collective influence of patient race, provider racial bias, and clinical ambiguity on providers' pain management decisions. These results could inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving pain care.

AB  - Abstract To fully utilize the advances in omics technologies and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human diseases, novel computational methods are required for integrative analysis of multiple types of omics data. Here, we present a novel multi-omics integrative method named Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) for biomedical classification. MOGONET jointly explores omics-specific learning and cross-omics correlation learning for effective multi-omics data classification. We demonstrate that MOGONET outperforms other state-of-the-art supervised multi-omics integrative analysis approaches from different biomedical classification applications using mRNA expression data, DNA methylation data, and microRNA expression data. Furthermore, MOGONET can identify important biomarkers from different omics data types related to the investigated biomedical problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND Family satisfaction with end-of-life care in the ICU has not previously been systematically reviewed. Our objective was to perform a review, synthesizing published data identifying factors associated with family satisfaction with end-of-life care in critically ill adult populations. METHODS The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), MEDLINE Updated, EMBASE (Excerpta Medical Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycInfo, and PubMed. Two authors reviewed retrieved titles and abstracts. Studies describing nonadult and non-ICU populations or not addressing end-of-life care, family satisfaction, or factors affecting satisfaction were excluded. The remaining articles underwent full review and data extraction by two authors. Quality was assessed using a checklist based on the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials group. RESULTS The search yielded 1,072 articles, with 23 articles describing 14 studies meeting inclusion criteria. All studies obtained satisfaction data from family members via surveys and structured interviews. Specific communication strategies increasing satisfaction included: expressions of empathy, nonabandonment, and assurances of comfort and provision of written information. Additionally, support for shared decision-making, family presence at time of death, and specific patient-care measures such as extubation before death were associated with increased satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS Good-quality communication, support for shared decision-making, and specific patient-care measures were associated with increased satisfaction with end-of-life care. Assessing the family's desire to participate in shared decision-making may also be an important factor. Few interventions increased satisfaction. Future research is needed to further define optimal communication strategies, understand effective integration of palliative care into the ICU, and define significant score changes in survey instruments.

AB  - Abstract Patients admitted for acute heart failure (AHF) experience high rates of in‐hospital and post‐discharge morbidity and mortality despite current therapies. Serelaxin is recombinant human relaxin‐2, a hormone with vasodilatory and end‐organ protective effects believed to play a central role in the cardiovascular and renal adaptations of human pregnancy. In the phase 3 RELAX‐AHF trial, serelaxin met its primary endpoint of improving dyspnoea through day 5 in patients admitted for AHF. Compared to placebo, serelaxin also reduced worsening heart failure (WHF) by 47% through day 5 and both all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality by 37% through day 180. RELAX‐AHF‐2 ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01870778) is designed to confirm serelaxin's effect on these clinical outcomes. RELAX‐AHF‐2 is a multicentre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, event‐driven, phase 3 trial enrolling ∼6800 patients hospitalized for AHF with dyspnoea, congestion on chest radiograph, increased natriuretic peptide levels, mild‐to‐moderate renal insufficiency, and systolic blood pressure ≥125 mmHg. Patients are randomized within 16 h of presentation to 48 h intravenous infusions of serelaxin (30 µg/kg/day) or placebo, both in addition to standard of care treatments. The primary objectives are to demonstrate that serelaxin is superior to placebo in reducing: (i) 180 day cardiovascular death, and (ii) occurrence of WHF through day 5. Key secondary endpoints include 180 day all‐cause mortality, composite of 180 day combined cardiovascular mortality or heart failure/renal failure rehospitalization, and in‐hospital length of stay during index AHF. The results from RELAX‐AHF‐2 will provide data on the potential beneficial effect of serelaxin on cardiovascular mortality and WHF in selected patients with AHF.

AB  - Objective Although depression is a risk and prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression trials involving cardiac patients have not observed the anticipated cardiovascular benefits. To test our hypothesis that depression treatment delivered before clinical CVD onset reduces risk of CVD events, we conducted an 8-year follow-up study of the Indiana sites of the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) randomized controlled trial. Methods Participants were 235 primary care patients 60 years or older with major depression or dysthymia who were randomized to a 12-month collaborative care program involving antidepressants and psychotherapy (85 without and 35 with baseline CVD) or usual care (83 without and 32 with baseline CVD). Hard CVD events (fatal/nonfatal) were identified using electronic medical record and Medicare/Medicaid data. Results A total of 119 patients (51%) had a hard CVD event. As hypothesized, the treatment × baseline CVD interaction was significant (p = .021). IMPACT patients without baseline CVD had a 48% lower risk of an event than did usual care patients (28% versus 47%, hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–0.86). The number needed to treat to prevent one event for 5 years was 6.1. The likelihood of an event did not differ between IMPACT and usual care patients with baseline CVD (86% versus 81%, hazard ratio = 1.19, 95% confidence interval, 0.70–2.03). Conclusions Collaborative depression care delivered before CVD onset halved the excess risk of hard CVD events among older, depressed patients. Our findings raise the possibility that the IMPACT intervention could be used as a CVD primary prevention strategy. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01561105.

AB  - Background: Implementation of the electronic health record (EHR) has changed the dynamics of doctor–patient communication. Physicians train to use EHRs from a technical standpoint, giving only minimal attention to integrating the human dimensions of the doctor–patient relationship into the computer-accompanied medical visit. Description: This article reviews the literature and proposes a model to help clinicians, residents, and students improve physician–patient communication while using the EHR. Evaluation: We conducted a literature search on use of communication skills when interfacing with the EHR. We observed an instructional gap and developed a model using evidence-based communication skills. Conclusion: This model integrates patient-centered interview skills and aims to empower physicians to remain patient centered while effectively using EHRs. It may also serve as a template for future educational and practice interventions for use of the EHR in the examination room.

AB  - Abstract Counterfeit medicines are a fundamental security problem. Counterfeiting medication poses a tremendous threat to patient safety, public health, and the economy in developed and less developed countries. Current solutions are often vulnerable due to the limited security levels. We propose that the highest protection against counterfeit medicines would be a combination of a physically unclonable function (PUF) with on-dose authentication. A PUF can provide a digital fingerprint with multiple pairs of input challenges and output responses. On-dose authentication can verify every individual pill without removing the identification tag. Here, we report on-dose PUFs that can be directly attached onto the surface of medicines, be swallowed, and digested. Fluorescent proteins and silk proteins serve as edible photonic biomaterials and the photoluminescent properties provide parametric support of challenge-response pairs. Such edible cryptographic primitives can play an important role in pharmaceutical anti-counterfeiting and other security applications requiring immediate destruction or vanishing features.

AB  - Blacks in comparison with whites are at risk for a more serious form of hypertension with high rates of complications. Greater sodium retention is thought to underlie the blood pressure (BP)-determining physiology of blacks, but specific mechanisms have not been identified. In a prospective observational study of BP, 226 black children and 314 white children (mean age, 10.6 years) were enrolled initially. Assessments were repeated in 85 blacks and 136 whites after reaching adulthood (mean age, 31 years). The relationship of BP to plasma aldosterone concentration in the context of the prevailing level of plasma renin activity was studied in blacks and whites. In a secondary interventional study, 9-α fludrocortisone was administered for 2 weeks to healthy adult blacks and whites to simulate hyperaldosteronism. BP responses in the 2 race groups were then compared. Although black children had lower levels of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, their BP was positively associated with the plasma aldosterone concentration, an effect that increased as plasma renin activity decreased (P=0.004). Data from black adults yielded similar results. No similar relationship was observed in whites. In the interventional study, 9-α fludrocortisone increased BP in blacks but not in whites. In conclusion, aldosterone sensitivity is a significant determinant of BP in young blacks. Although its role in establishing the risk of hypertension is not known, it could be as relevant as the actual level of aldosterone.

AB  - Delirium is a serious and common acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with short- and long-term adverse health outcomes. However, relatively little delirium research has been conducted in unselected populations. Epidemiologic research in such populations has the potential to resolve several questions of clinical significance in delirium. Part 1 of this article explores the importance of population selection, case-ascertainment, attrition, and confounding. Part 2 examines a specific question in delirium epidemiology: What is the relationship between delirium and trajectories of cognitive decline? This section assesses previous work through two systematic reviews and proposes a design for investigating delirium in the context of longitudinal cohort studies. Such a design requires robust links between community and hospital settings. Practical considerations for case-ascertainment in the hospital, as well as the necessary quality control of these programs, are outlined. We argue that attention to these factors is important if delirium research is to benefit fully from a population perspective.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Despite the prevalence and the functional, psychological, and economic impact of chronic pain, few intervention studies of treatment of chronic pain in veterans have been performed. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine whether a stepped-care intervention is more effective than usual care, as hypothesized, in reducing pain-related disability, pain interference, and pain severity. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> We performed a randomized clinical trial comparing stepped care with usual care for chronic pain. We enrolled 241 veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn with chronic (&gt;3 months) and disabling (Roland Morris Disability Scale score, ≥7) musculoskeletal pain of the cervical or lumbar spine or extremities (shoulders, knees, and hips) in the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial from December 20, 2007, through June 30, 2011. The 9-month follow-up was completed by April 2012. Patients received treatment at a postdeployment clinic and 5 general medicine clinics at a Veterans Affairs medical center. <h3>Interventions</h3> Step 1 included 12 weeks of analgesic treatment and optimization according to an algorithm coupled with pain self-management strategies; step 2, 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy. All intervention aspects were delivered by nurse care managers. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Pain-related disability (Roland Morris Disability Scale), pain interference (Brief Pain Inventory), and pain severity (Graded Chronic Pain Scale). <h3>Results</h3> The primary analysis included 121 patients receiving the stepped-care intervention and 120 patients receiving usual care. At 9 months, the mean decrease from baseline in the Roland Morris Disability Scale score was 1.7 (95% CI, −2.6 to −0.9) points in the usual care group and 3.7 (95% CI, −4.5 to −2.8) points in the intervention group (between-group difference, −1.9 [95% CI, −3.2 to −0.7] points;<i>P</i> = .002). The mean decrease from baseline in the Pain Interference subscale score of the Brief Pain Inventory was 0.9 points in the usual care group and 1.7 points in the intervention group (between-group difference, −0.8 [95% CI, −1.3 to −0.3] points;<i>P</i> = .003). The Graded Chronic Pain Scale severity score was reduced by 4.5 points in the usual care group and 11.1 points in the intervention group (between-group difference, −6.6 [95% CI, −10.5 to −2.7] points;<i>P</i> = .001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> A stepped-care intervention that combined analgesics, self-management strategies, and brief cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain-related disability, pain interference, and pain severity in veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT00386243

AB  - Despite its popularity, little is known about the measurement invariance of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) across U.S. sociodemographic groups. Use of a screener shown not to possess measurement invariance could result in under/over-detection of depression, potentially exacerbating sociodemographic disparities in depression. Therefore, we assessed the factor structure and measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 across major U.S. sociodemographic groups.U.S. population representative data came from the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts. We conducted a measurement invariance analysis of 31,366 respondents across sociodemographic factors of sex, race/ethnicity, and education level.Considering results of single-group confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), depression theory, and research utility, we justify a two-factor structure for the PHQ-9 consisting of a cognitive/affective factor and a somatic factor (RMSEA = 0.034, TLI = 0.985, CFI = 0.989). On the basis of multiple-group CFAs testing configural, scalar, and strict factorial invariance, we determined that invariance held for sex, race/ethnicity, and education level groups, as all models demonstrated close model fit (RMSEA = 0.025-0.025, TLI = 0.985-0.992, CFI = 0.986-0.991). Finally, for all steps ΔCFI was <-0.004, and ΔRMSEA was <0.01.We demonstrate that the PHQ-9 is acceptable to use in major U.S. sociodemographic groups and allows for meaningful comparisons in total, cognitive/affective, and somatic depressive symptoms across these groups, extending its use to the community. This knowledge is timely as medicine moves towards alternative payment models emphasizing high-quality and cost-efficient care, which will likely incentivize behavioral and population health efforts. We also provide a consistent, evidence-based approach for calculating PHQ-9 subscale scores.

AB  - To fully utilize the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies for identifying cell lineages and bona fide transcriptional signals, it is necessary to combine data from multiple experiments. We present BERMUDA (Batch Effect ReMoval Using Deep Autoencoders), a novel transfer-learning-based method for batch effect correction in scRNA-seq data. BERMUDA effectively combines different batches of scRNA-seq data with vastly different cell population compositions and amplifies biological signals by transferring information among batches. We demonstrate that BERMUDA outperforms existing methods for removing batch effects and distinguishing cell types in multiple simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets.

AB  - Abstract Older adults compared with younger adults are characterized by greater endogenous pain facilitation and a reduced capacity to endogenously inhibit pain, potentially placing them at a greater risk for chronic pain. Previous research suggests that higher levels of self-reported physical activity are associated with more effective pain inhibition and less pain facilitation on quantitative sensory tests in healthy adults. However, no studies have directly tested the relationship between physical activity behavior and pain modulatory function in older adults. This study examined whether objective measures of physical activity behavior cross-sectionally predicted pain inhibitory function on the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) test and pain facilitation on the temporal summation (TS) test in healthy older adults. Fifty-one older adults wore an accelerometer on the hip for 7 days and completed the CPM and TS tests. Measures of sedentary time, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were obtained from the accelerometer. Hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to determine the relationship of TS and CPM with levels of physical activity, while controlling for demographic, psychological, and test variables. The results indicated that sedentary time and LPA significantly predicted pain inhibitory function on the CPM test, with less sedentary time and greater LPA per day associated with greater pain inhibitory capacity. Additionally, MVPA predicted pain facilitation on the TS test, with greater MVPA associated with less TS of pain. These results suggest that different types of physical activity behavior may differentially impact pain inhibitory and facilitatory processes in older adults.

AB  - To compile and analyze critically the literature published on street children and substance use in resource-constrained settings.We searched the literature systematically and used meta-analytical procedures to synthesize literature that met the review's inclusion criteria. Pooled-prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model for life-time substance use by geographical region as well as by type of substance used.Fifty studies from 22 countries were included into the review. Meta-analysis of combined life-time substance use from 27 studies yielded an overall drug use pooled-prevalence estimate of 60% (95% CI = 51-69%). Studies from 14 countries contributed to an overall pooled prevalence for street children's reported inhalant use of 47% (95% CI = 36-58%). This review reveals significant gaps in the literature, including a dearth of data on physical and mental health outcomes, HIV and mortality in association with street children's substance use.Street children from resource-constrained settings reported high life-time substance use. Inhalants are the predominant substances used, followed by tobacco, alcohol and marijuana.

AB  - There is growing evidence that opioid prescribing in the United States follows a pattern in which patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from opioids are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy. These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06-3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20-9.24). In sum, we found evidence of greater opioid receipt among commercially insured patients with a breadth of psychiatric conditions. Future studies assessing behavioral outcomes associated with opioid prescribing should consider preexisting psychiatric conditions.

AB  - •Patients who receive antiandrogen treatments are more likely to develop CRPC.•A genomic landscape study has identified aberrant epigenetic events in CRPC and NEPC development.•Epigenetic targeting may represent an alternative therapeutic regimen for advanced prostate cancer.•Ongoing preclinical and clinical trials have shed light on the advantage of combination therapies. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. Antiandrogen therapies are part of the standard of therapeutic regimen for advanced or metastatic prostate cancers; however, patients who receive these treatments are more likely to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). In the development of CRPC or NEPC, numerous genetic signaling pathways have been under preclinical investigations and in clinical trials. Accumulated evidence shows that DNA methylation, chromatin integrity, and accessibility for transcriptional regulation still play key roles in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Better understanding of how epigenetic change regulates the progression of prostate cancer and the interaction between epigenetic and genetic modulators driving NEPC may help develop a better risk stratification and more effective treatment regimens for prostate cancer patients.

AB  - In Electronic Health Records (EHRs), much of valuable information regarding patients’ conditions is embedded in free text format. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been developed to extract clinical information from free text. One challenge faced in clinical NLP is that the meaning of clinical entities is heavily affected by modifiers such as negation. A negation detection algorithm, NegEx, applies a simplistic approach that has been shown to be powerful in clinical NLP. However, due to the failure to consider the contextual relationship between words within a sentence, NegEx fails to correctly capture the negation status of concepts in complex sentences. Incorrect negation assignment could cause inaccurate diagnosis of patients’ condition or contaminated study cohorts. We developed a negation algorithm called DEEPEN to decrease NegEx’s false positives by taking into account the dependency relationship between negation words and concepts within a sentence using Stanford dependency parser. The system was developed and tested using EHR data from Indiana University (IU) and it was further evaluated on Mayo Clinic dataset to assess its generalizability. The evaluation results demonstrate DEEPEN, which incorporates dependency parsing into NegEx, can reduce the number of incorrect negation assignment for patients with positive findings, and therefore improve the identification of patients with the target clinical findings in EHRs.

AB  - Objectives: Data are lacking regarding implementation of novel strategies such as follow-up clinics and peer support groups, to reduce the burden of postintensive care syndrome. We sought to discover enablers that helped hospital-based clinicians establish post-ICU clinics and peer support programs, and identify barriers that challenged them. Design: Qualitative inquiry. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to organize and analyze data. Setting: Two learning collaboratives (ICU follow-up clinics and peer support groups), representing 21 sites, across three continents. Subjects: Clinicians from 21 sites. Measurement and Main Results: Ten enablers and nine barriers to implementation of “ICU follow-up clinics” were described. A key enabler to generate support for clinics was providing insight into the human experience of survivorship, to obtain interest from hospital administrators. Significant barriers included patient and family lack of access to clinics and clinic funding. Nine enablers and five barriers to the implementation of “peer support groups” were identified. Key enablers included developing infrastructure to support successful operationalization of this complex intervention, flexibility about when peer support should be offered, belonging to the international learning collaborative. Significant barriers related to limited attendance by patients and families due to challenges in creating awareness, and uncertainty about who might be appropriate to attend and target in advertising. Conclusions: Several enablers and barriers to implementing ICU follow-up clinics and peer support groups should be taken into account and leveraged to improve ICU recovery. Among the most important enablers are motivated clinician leaders who persist to find a path forward despite obstacles.

AB  - Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a disruptive symptom for many survivors. Despite promising evidence for efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in reducing CRF, no trials comparing it to an active comparator for fatigued survivors have been published. The purpose of this trial was to compare MBSR to psychoeducation for CRF and associated symptoms. Breast (n = 60) and colorectal (n = 11) cancer survivors (stage 0–III) with clinically significant CRF after completing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy an average of 28 months prior to enrollment were randomized to MBSR or psychoeducation/support groups (PES). MBSR focused on mindfulness training; PES focused on CRF self-management. Outcomes included CRF interference (primary), CRF severity and global improvement, vitality, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and pain. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3) using intent-to-treat analysis. Between-group differences in CRF interference were not significant at any time point; however, there was a trend favoring MBSR (d = −0.46, p = 0.073) at T2. MBSR participants reported significantly greater improvement in vitality (d = 0.53, p = 0.003) and were more likely to report CRF as moderately to completely improved compared to the PES group (χ2 (1) = 4.1765, p = 0.041) at T2. MBSR participants also reported significantly greater reductions in pain at T2 (d = 0.53, p = 0.014). In addition, both MBSR and PES produced moderate-to-large and significant within-group improvements in all fatigue outcomes, depression, anxiety, and sleep at T2 and T3 compared to T1. MBSR and PES appear efficacious for CRF and related symptoms. Larger trials including a usual care arm are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01724333.

AB  - Personas are a canonical user-centered design method increasingly used in health informatics research. Personas—empirically-derived user archetypes—can be used by eHealth designers to gain a robust understanding of their target end users such as patients. To develop biopsychosocial personas of older patients with heart failure using quantitative analysis of survey data. Data were collected using standardized surveys and medical record abstraction from 32 older adults with heart failure recently hospitalized for acute heart failure exacerbation. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on a final dataset of n = 30. Nonparametric analyses were used to identify differences between clusters on 30 clustering variables and seven outcome variables. Six clusters were produced, ranging in size from two to eight patients per cluster. Clusters differed significantly on these biopsychosocial domains and subdomains: demographics (age, sex); medical status (comorbid diabetes); functional status (exhaustion, household work ability, hygiene care ability, physical ability); psychological status (depression, health literacy, numeracy); technology (Internet availability); healthcare system (visit by home healthcare, trust in providers); social context (informal caregiver support, cohabitation, marital status); and economic context (employment status). Tabular and narrative persona descriptions provide an easy reference guide for informatics designers. Personas development using approaches such as clustering of structured survey data is an important tool for health informatics professionals. We describe insights from our study of patients with heart failure, then recommend a generic ten-step personas development process. Methods strengths and limitations of the study and of personas development generally are discussed.

AB  - In response to increases in harms associated with prescription opioids, opioid prescribing has come under greater scrutiny, leading many health care organizations and providers to consider or mandate opioid dose reductions (tapering) for patients with chronic pain. Communicating about tapering can be difficult, particularly for patients receiving long-term opioids who perceive benefits and are using their medications as prescribed. Because of the importance of effective patient–provider communication for pain management and recent health system-level initiatives and provider practices to taper opioids, this study used qualitative methods to understand communication processes related to opioid tapering, to identify best practices and opportunities for improvement. Up to 3 clinic visits per patient were audio-recorded, and individual interviews were conducted with patients and their providers. Four major themes emerged: 1) explaining—patients needed to understand individualized reasons for tapering, beyond general, population-level concerns such as addiction potential, 2) negotiating—patients needed to have input, even if it was simply the rate of tapering, 3) managing difficult conversations—when patients and providers did not reach a shared understanding, difficulties and misunderstandings arose, and 4) nonabandonment—patients needed to know that their providers would not abandon them throughout the tapering process. Perspective Although opioid tapering can be challenging, helping patients to understand individualized reasons for tapering, encouraging patients to have input into the process, and assuring patients they would not be abandoned all appear to facilitate optimal communication about tapering.

AB  - The healthcare system is ill-equipped to meet the needs of adults on the autism spectrum. Our goal was to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to develop and evaluate tools to facilitate the primary healthcare of autistic adults. Toolkit development included cognitive interviewing and test–retest reliability studies. Evaluation consisted of a mixed-methods, single-arm pre/post-intervention comparison. A total of 259 autistic adults and 51 primary care providers (PCPs) residing in the United States. The AASPIRE Healthcare toolkit includes the Autism Healthcare Accommodations Tool (AHAT)—a tool that allows patients to create a personalized accommodations report for their PCP—and general healthcare- and autism-related information, worksheets, checklists, and resources for patients and healthcare providers. Satisfaction with patient–provider communication, healthcare self-efficacy, barriers to healthcare, and satisfaction with the toolkit’s usability and utility; responses to open-ended questions. Preliminary testing of the AHAT demonstrated strong content validity and adequate test–retest stability. Almost all patient participants (>94 %) felt that the AHAT and the toolkit were easy to use, important, and useful. In pre/post-intervention comparisons, the mean number of barriers decreased (from 4.07 to 2.82, p < 0.0001), healthcare self-efficacy increased (from 37.9 to 39.4, p = 0.02), and satisfaction with PCP communication improved (from 30.9 to 32.6, p = 0.03). Patients stated that the toolkit helped clarify their needs, enabled them to self-advocate and prepare for visits more effectively, and positively influenced provider behavior. Most of the PCPs surveyed read the AHAT (97 %), rated it as moderately or very useful (82 %), and would recommend it to other patients (87 %). The CBPR process resulted in a reliable healthcare accommodation tool and a highly accessible healthcare toolkit. Patients and providers indicated that the tools positively impacted healthcare interactions. The toolkit has the potential to reduce barriers to healthcare and improve healthcare self-efficacy and patient–provider communication.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emphasizing societal benefits of vaccines has been linked to increased vaccination intentions in adults. It is unclear if this pattern holds for parents deciding whether to vaccinate their children. The objective was to determine whether emphasizing the benefits of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination directly to the vaccine recipient or to society differentially impacts parents' vaccine intentions for their infants. METHODS: In a national online survey, parents (N = 802) of infants &amp;lt;12 months old were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 MMR vaccine messages: (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), (2) VIS and information emphasizing the MMR vaccine's benefits to the child, (3) VIS and information emphasizing societal benefits, or (4) VIS and information emphasizing benefits both to the child and society. Parents reported their likelihood of vaccinating their infants for MMR on a response scale of 0 (extremely unlikely) to 100 (extremely likely). RESULTS: Compared with the VIS-only group (mean intention = 86.3), parents reported increased vaccine intentions for their infants when receiving additional information emphasizing the MMR vaccine’s benefits either directly to the child (mean intention = 91.6, P = .01) or to both the child and society (mean intention = 90.8, P = .03). Emphasizing the MMR vaccine’s benefits only to society did not increase intentions (mean intention = 86.4, P = .97). CONCLUSIONS: We did not see increases in parents’ MMR vaccine intentions for their infants when societal benefits were emphasized without mention of benefits directly to the child. This finding suggests that providers should emphasize benefits directly to the child. Mentioning societal benefits seems to neither add value to, nor interfere with, information highlighting benefits directly to the child.

AB  - Healthcare is an information business with expanding use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise.Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices.ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> A systematic compilation of children and youth’s reported reasons for street involvement is lacking. Without empirical data on these reasons, the policies developed or implemented to mitigate street involvement are not responsive to the needs of these children and youth. <h3>Objective</h3> To systematically analyze the self-reported reasons why children and youth around the world become street-involved and to analyze the available data by level of human development, geographic region, and sex. <h3>Data Sources</h3> Electronic searches of Scopus, PsychINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from January 1, 1990, to the third week of July 2013. We searched the peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported quantitative reasons for street involvement. The following broad search strategy was used to search the databases: “street children” OR “street youth” OR “homeless youth” OR “homeless children” OR “runaway children” OR “runaway youth” or “homeless persons.” <h3>Study Selection</h3> Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were 24 years of age or younger, (2) participants met our definition of street-connected children and youth, and (3) the quantitative reasons for street involvement were reported. We reviewed 318 full texts and identified 49 eligible studies. <h3>Data Extraction and Synthesis</h3> Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. We fit logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the pooled prevalence of each reason and to estimate subgroup pooled prevalence by development level or geographic region. The meta-analysis was conducted from February to August 2015. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> We created the following categories based on the reported reasons in the literature: poverty, abuse, family conflict, delinquency, psychosocial health, and other. <h3>Results</h3> In total, there were 13 559 participants from 24 countries, of which 21 represented developing countries. The most commonly reported reason for street involvement was poverty, with a pooled-prevalence estimate of 39% (95% CI, 29%-51%). Forty-seven studies included in this review reported family conflict as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 32% (95% CI, 26%-39%). Abuse was equally reported in developing and developed countries as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 26% (95% CI, 18%-35%). Delinquency was the least frequently cited reason overall, with a pooled prevalence of 10% (95% CI, 5%-20%). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> The street-connected children and youth who provided reasons for their street involvement infrequently identified delinquent behaviors for their circumstances and highlighted the role of poverty as a driving factor. They require support and protection, and governments globally are called on to reduce the socioeconomic inequities that cause children and youth to turn to the streets in the first place, in all regions of the world.

AB  - With greater scrutiny on primary care providers' (PCPs) approaches to chronic pain management, more research is needed to clarify how concerns and uncertainties about opioid therapy affect the ways both patients with chronic pain and PCPs experience primary care interactions. The goal of this qualitative study was to develop a better understanding of the respective experiences, perceptions, and challenges that patients with chronic pain and PCPs face communicating with each other about pain management.Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to identify 14 PCPs. Patients who received ≥6 opioid prescriptions during the prior year were selected at random from the panels of participating physicians. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted individually with patients and PCPs.VISN 11 Roudebush VA Medical Center (RVAMC) in Indianapolis, Indiana.Fourteen PCPs and 26 patients with chronic pain participated.An inductive thematic analysis was conducted separately with patient and PCP interview data, after which the emergent themes for both groups were compared and contrasted.Three notable tensions between patients and PCPs were discovered: 1) the role of discussing pain versus other primary care concerns, 2) acknowledgment of pain and the search for objective evidence, and 3) recognition of patient individuality and consideration of relationship history.Competing demands of primary care practice, differing beliefs about pain, and uncertainties about the appropriate place of opioid therapy in chronic pain management likely contributed to the identified tensions. Several clinical communication strategies to help PCPs mitigate and manage pain-related tensions are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: There is little information on the association of the APOEe4 allele and AD risk in African populations. In previous analyses from the Indianapolis-Ibadan dementia project, we have reported that APOE ε4 increased the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African Americans but not in Yoruba. This study represents a replication of this earlier work using enriched cohorts and extending the analysis to include cognitive decline. Methods: In this longitudinal study of two community dwelling cohorts of elderly Yoruba and African Americans, APOE genotyping was conducted from blood samples taken on or before 2001 (1,871 African Americans &amp; 2,200 Yoruba). Mean follow up time was 8.5 years for African Americans and 8.8 years for Yoruba. The effects of heterozygosity or homozygosity of ε4 and of the possession of e4 on time to incident AD and on cognitive decline were determined using Cox's proportional hazards regression and mixed effects models. Results: After adjusting for covariates, one or two copies of the APOE ε4 allele were significant risk factors for incident AD ( p &lt; 0.0001) and cognitive decline in the African-American population ( p &lt; 0001). In the Yoruba, only homozygosity for APOE ε4 was a significant risk factor for AD ( p = 0.0002) but not for cognitive decline ( p = 0.2346), however, possession of an e4 allele was significant for both incident AD ( p = 0.0489) and cognitive decline ( p = 0.0425). Conclusions: In this large longitudinal comparative study, APOE ε4 had a significant, but weaker, effect on incident AD and on cognitive decline in Yoruba than in African Americans. The reasons for these differences remain unclear.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic pain poses numerous challenges for patients and providers, particularly when opioid treatment is discussed. Despite accounts of antagonistic patient–provider communication, little is known about how communication about opioids unfolds during clinic visits and, importantly, how the relationship history of a patient and physician shapes this communication. This study's objective was to advance understanding of communication about opioid treatment by recording primary care clinic visits and conducting in‐depth interviews with patients to gain insight into the patient–provider relationship and its influence on clinical communication. Methods Forty patients with chronic pain were audio recorded during their primary care clinic appointments and then interviewed about their pain care and relationships with their providers. Ten patients were excluded from analysis because pain was not discussed during the clinic visit. Results Qualitative analysis revealed that patients responded in markedly different ways to similar physician treatment decisions about opioids. Some patients attributed limiting or denying opioids to physicians' distrust or lack of caring. Others attributed these limitations to acting out of genuine concern for patients' health. These attributions appeared to be shaped by features of the patient–physician relationship as described by patients. Results are discussed within the framework of attribution theory. Conclusions Understanding how patients and providers discuss opioid treatment is critical for optimal pain treatment. Physicians might be able to improve communication by re‐framing treatment discussions about opioids around external factors, such as benefits and harms, and engaging in communication that fosters a strong therapeutic alliance and emphasizes concern for the patient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate possible racial differences in opioid prescriptions among primary care patients with chronic noncancer pain receiving care in the Veterans Affairs health care system. This was a retrospective cohort study of 99,903 veterans with diagnoses of low back, neck, or joint pain selected to participate in the Veterans Affairs Survey of the Healthcare Experiences of Patients in fiscal year 2006. The outcome was prescription of opioids in the year following the first pain diagnosis, obtained through electronic medical record data. Analyses incorporated fixed effects for race, most recent pain intensity rating, new or established primary care patient status, and an interaction between race and most recent pain intensity rating, together with random effects for health care facility and race within facility. The association between patient race and prescription of opioids was moderated by baseline level of pain intensity scores (assessed on a 0–10 scale) and patient age. Among patients under 65 years of age, blacks with moderate (4–6) or high (7–10) levels of pain were less likely to receive opioids than whites (P = .0025, P = .0011); however, there were no significant differences between black and white patients with low levels of pain intensity (1–3) and those with pain intensity ratings of 0 (no pain). Among patients 65 and older with pain intensity ratings of zero, blacks were more likely than whites to receive opioid prescriptions (P = .0087), but there were no significant racial differences in opioid prescriptions in those with low to high levels of pain. Perspective Among veterans under age 65 reporting moderate to high levels of chronic noncancer pain, blacks were less likely to be prescribed opioids than whites, even after controlling for clinical and system-level factors. Results underscore the challenges of eliminating racial differences in pain treatment, despite comprehensive systemwide improvement initiatives.

AB  - Purpose To better understand how confidentiality impacts the delivery of preventive adolescent health care by examining adolescent and parent beliefs and the relationship between confidentiality and the number and subject matter of health topics discussed at the last visit. Methods This study represents a secondary analysis of nationally representative online survey data collected from adolescents aged 13–17 years (N = 504) and parents of adolescents aged 13–17 years (N = 500). Descriptive statistics were conducted on confidentiality variables of interest. Analysis of variance and Scheffe post hoc tests were computed to determine whether the mean number of topics discussed varied by level of confidential consultation provided. Associations between confidential consultation and health topics discussed at the last visit were examined using multivariate logistic regression. Results Approximately, half of both samples reported provision of confidential consultation. Eighty-nine percent of parents believed adolescents should be able to speak with providers alone, yet 61% preferred to be in examination room for the entire visit. Nearly half of all adolescents believed parental presence impacted conversation. Mean number of topics discussed was significantly higher when a visit was partially confidential (4.11 ± 3.05; p = 0) versus when a visit was not confidential (2.76 ± 2.68; p = 0). There were significant associations between confidential consultation and discussions about 8 of 11 health topics. Conclusions Confidential consultation significantly impacts the number and subject matter of health topics discussed. A split-visit confidentiality model for adolescent preventive care visits may result in clinical conversations that address more topics. This arrangement may also appeal to parents who have mixed feelings about confidentiality.

AB  - Measures for assessing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that may have initially been developed for research are increasingly being recommended for use in clinical practice as well. Although psychometric rigor is essential, this article focuses on pragmatic characteristics of PROs that may enhance uptake into clinical practice.Three sources were drawn on in identifying pragmatic criteria for PROs: (1) selected literature review including recommendations by other expert groups; (2) key features of several model public domain PROs; and (3) the authors' experience in developing practical PROs.Eight characteristics of a practical PRO include: (1) actionability (i.e., scores guide diagnostic or therapeutic actions/decision making); (2) appropriateness for the relevant clinical setting; (3) universality (i.e., for screening, severity assessment, and monitoring across multiple conditions); (4) self-administration; (5) item features (number of items and bundling issues); (6) response options (option number and dimensions, uniform vs. varying options, time frame, intervals between options); (7) scoring (simplicity and interpretability); and (8) accessibility (nonproprietary, downloadable, available in different languages and for vulnerable groups, and incorporated into electronic health records).Balancing psychometric and pragmatic factors in the development of PROs is important for accelerating the incorporation of PROs into clinical practice.

AB  - Depression, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety commonly co-occur with chronic pain. However, the degree to which improvement in these psychological comorbidities predicts subsequent pain outcomes and, in particular, the relative effects of these 3 psychological factors with respect to each other is only partially known. Longitudinal analysis of 250 primary care patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain enrolled in the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE) trial was examined, using data gathered at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months. Mixed effects model repeated measures analyses were used to determine if changes in depression, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety predicted a subsequent reduction in pain intensity or interference and pain-related disability. Defining a clinically significant change as twice the standard error of measurement for each predictor, we found that a 2-standard error of measurement improvement in depression, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety resulted in, respectively, an effect size decrease in pain intensity or interference of .45, .33, and .12; a 14%, 12%, and 6% reduction in the number of pain-specific disability days; and a 43%, 30%, and 28% decreased likelihood of high disability (defined as ≥10 pain-specific disability days in the past 4 weeks). In summary, improvements in 3 common psychological comorbidities predicted better pain outcomes. Perspective Because depression, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety commonly accompany chronic pain and might adversely affect pain outcomes, treatment of these modifiable psychological factors is warranted to optimize the effectiveness of pain-specific therapies.

AB  - To compare the sensitivity to change and the responsiveness to intervention of the PROMIS Pain Interference short forms, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), 3-item PEG scale, and SF-36 Bodily Pain subscale in a sample of patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain of moderate severity.Standardized response means, standardized effect sizes, and receiver operating curve analyses were used to assess change between baseline and 3-month assessments in 250 participants who participated in a randomized clinical effectiveness trial of collaborative telecare management for moderate to severe and persistent musculoskeletal pain.The BPI, PEG, and SF-36 Bodily Pain measures were more sensitive to patient-reported global change than the PROMIS Pain Interference short forms, especially for the clinically improved group, for which the change detected by the PROMIS short forms was not statistically significant. The BPI was more responsive to the clinical intervention than the SF-36 Bodily Pain and PROMIS Pain Interference measures. Post hoc analyses exploring these findings did not suggest that differences in content or rating scale structure (number of response options or anchoring language) adequately explained the observed differences in the detection of change.In this clinical trial, the BPI and PEG measures were better able to detect change than the SF-36 Bodily Pain and PROMIS Pain Interference measures.

AB  - Best-practice models of dementia care have evolved from strategies focused on family caregivers to guidelines predicated on supporting the patient-caregiver dyad along the care continuum. These models have grown in complexity to encompass medical and team-based care that is designed to coordinate dementia care across settings and providers for a defined population of patients. Although there is evidence that the models can improve outcomes, they have not been widely adopted. Barriers to the models' increased adoption include workforce limitations, the cost of necessary practice redesign, and limited evidence of their potential cost-effectiveness. We summarize the origins, evidence base, and common components of best-practice models of dementia care, and we discuss barriers to their implementation. We conclude by describing two current efforts to implement such models on a broad scale, supported by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Taken together, these models seek to demonstrate improved dementia care quality and outcomes, accompanied by cost savings, in both community-based and institutional care settings.

AB  - Several methods are recommended equally strongly for colorectal cancer screening in average-risk persons. Risk stratification would enable tailoring of screening within this group, with less invasive tests (sigmoidoscopy or occult blood tests) for lower-risk persons and colonoscopy for higher-risk persons.To create a risk index for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer and adenomas or serrated polyps ≥1.0 cm, villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia) anywhere in the colorectum, using the most common risk factors for colorectal neoplasia.Cross-sectional study.Multiple endoscopy units, primarily in the Midwest.Persons aged 50 to 80 years undergoing initial screening colonoscopy (December 2004 to September 2011).Derivation and validation of a risk index based on points from regression coefficients for age, sex, waist circumference, cigarette smoking, and family history of colorectal cancer.Among 2993 persons in the derivation set, prevalence of advanced neoplasia was 9.4%. Risks for advanced neoplasia in persons at very low, low, intermediate, and high risk were 1.92% (95% CI, 0.63% to 4.43%), 4.88% (CI, 3.79% to 6.18%), 9.93% (CI, 8.09% to 12.0%), and 24.9% (CI, 21.1% to 29.1%), respectively (P < 0.001). Sigmoidoscopy to the descending colon in the low-risk groups would have detected 51 of 70 (73% [CI, 61% to 83%]) advanced neoplasms. Among 1467 persons in the validation set, corresponding risks for advanced neoplasia were 1.65% (CI, 0.20% to 5.84%), 3.31% (CI, 2.08% to 4.97%), 10.9% (CI, 8.26% to 14.1%), and 22.3% (CI, 16.9% to 28.5%), respectively (P < 0.001). Sigmoidoscopy would have detected 21 of 24 (87.5% [CI, 68% to 97%]) advanced neoplasms.Split-sample validation; results apply to first-time screening.This index stratifies risk for advanced neoplasia among average-risk persons by identifying lower-risk groups for which noncolonoscopy strategies may be effective and efficient and a higher-risk group for which colonoscopy may be preferred.National Cancer Institute, Walther Cancer Institute, Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, and Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.

AB  - Implement and perform pilot testing of web-based clinical decision support services using a novel framework for creating and managing clinical knowledge in a distributed fashion using the cloud. The pilot sought to (1) develop and test connectivity to an external clinical decision support (CDS) service, (2) assess the exchange of data to and knowledge from the external CDS service, and (3) capture lessons to guide expansion to more practice sites and users. The Clinical Decision Support Consortium created a repository of shared CDS knowledge for managing hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease in a community cloud hosted by Partners HealthCare. A limited data set for primary care patients at a separate health system was securely transmitted to a CDS rules engine hosted in the cloud. Preventive care reminders triggered by the limited data set were returned for display to clinician end users for review and display. During a pilot study, we (1) monitored connectivity and system performance, (2) studied the exchange of data and decision support reminders between the two health systems, and (3) captured lessons. During the six month pilot study, there were 1339 patient encounters in which information was successfully exchanged. Preventive care reminders were displayed during 57% of patient visits, most often reminding physicians to monitor blood pressure for hypertensive patients (29%) and order eye exams for patients with diabetes (28%). Lessons learned were grouped into five themes: performance, governance, semantic interoperability, ongoing adjustments, and usability. Remote, asynchronous cloud-based decision support performed reasonably well, although issues concerning governance, semantic interoperability, and usability remain key challenges for successful adoption and use of cloud-based CDS that will require collaboration between biomedical informatics and computer science disciplines. Decision support in the cloud is feasible and may be a reasonable path toward achieving better support of clinical decision-making across the widest range of health care providers.

AB  - Objectives To describe transitions in care for older adults with dementia identified from a nationally representative cohort and to describe transition rates in those with more‐severe levels of cognitive and functional impairment. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting Health and Retirement Study ( HRS ). Participants HRS respondents aged 65 and older whose survey data were linked with Medicare claims from 1999 to 2008 (N = 16,186). Measurements Transitions in care between home, home with formal services, hospital, and nursing facility care; cognitive function; activities of daily living; and mortality. Results The 3,447 (21.3%) HRS subjects who were ever diagnosed with dementia experienced frequent transitions. Of subjects transitioning from a hospital stay, 52.2% returned home without home care services, and 33.8% transitioned to a nursing facility. Of subjects transitioning from a nursing facility, 59.2% transitioned to the hospital, and 25.3% returned home without services. There were 2,139 transitions to death, and 58.7% of HRS subjects with dementia died at home. Even in persons with moderate to severe dementia, multiple transitions in care were documented, including transitions from the hospital to home and back to the hospital. Conclusion In this nationally representative sample of older adults, subjects diagnosed with dementia experience frequent transitions. Persons with dementia who are cared for at home and who transition back to home often have moderate to severe impairments in function and cognition.

AB  - Background: An accurate system for tracking of colonoscopy quality and surveillance intervals could improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and surveillance. The purpose of this study was to create and test such a system across multiple institutions utilizing natural language processing (NLP). Methods: From 42,569 colonoscopies with pathology records from 13 centers, we randomly sampled 750 paired reports. We trained (n=250) and tested (n=500) an NLP-based program with 19 measurements that encompass colonoscopy quality measures and surveillance interval determination, using blinded, paired, annotated expert manual review as the reference standard. The remaining 41,819 nonannotated documents were processed through the NLP system without manual review to assess performance consistency. The primary outcome was system accuracy across the 19 measures. Results: A total of 176 (23.5%) documents with 252 (1.8%) discrepant content points resulted from paired annotation. Error rate within the 500 test documents was 31.2% for NLP and 25.4% for the paired annotators (P=0.001). At the content point level within the test set, the error rate was 3.5% for NLP and 1.9% for the paired annotators (P=0.04). When eight vaguely worded documents were removed, 125 of 492 (25.4%) were incorrect by NLP and 104 of 492 (21.1%) by the initial annotator (P=0.07). Rates of pathologic findings calculated from NLP were similar to those calculated by annotation for the majority of measurements. Test set accuracy was 99.6% for CRC, 95% for advanced adenoma, 94.6% for nonadvanced adenoma, 99.8% for advanced sessile serrated polyps, 99.2% for nonadvanced sessile serrated polyps, 96.8% for large hyperplastic polyps, and 96.0% for small hyperplastic polyps. Lesion location showed high accuracy (87.0–99.8%). Accuracy for number of adenomas was 92%. Conclusions: NLP can accurately report adenoma detection rate and the components for determining guideline-adherent colonoscopy surveillance intervals across multiple sites that utilize different methods for reporting colonoscopy findings.

AB  - Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a common, fatigue-related symptom that disrupts cancer survivors' quality of life. Few interventions for CRCI exist. As part of a randomized pilot study targeting cancer-related fatigue, the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on survivors' cognitive outcomes were investigated.Breast and colorectal cancer survivors (n = 71) with moderate-to-severe fatigue were randomized to MBSR (n = 35) or a fatigue education and support (ES; n = 36) condition. The Attentional Function Index (AFI) and the Stroop test were used to assess survivors' cognitive function at baseline (T1), after the 8-week intervention period (T2), and 6 months later (T3) using intent-to-treat analysis. Mediation analyses were performed to explore mechanisms of intervention effects on cognitive functioning.MBSR participants reported significantly greater improvement on the AFI total score compared to ES participants at T2 (d = 0.83, p = 0.001) and T3 (d = 0.55, p = 0.021). MBSR also significantly outperformed ES on most AFI subscales, although both groups improved over time. MBSR produced greater Stroop accuracy rates relative to ES at T2 (r = 0.340, p = 0.005) and T3 (r = 0.280, p = 0.030), with improved accuracy over time only for the MBSR group. There were no significant differences in Stroop reaction time between groups. Improvements in mindfulness mediated the effect of group (e.g., MBSR vs. ES) on AFI total score at T2 and T3.Additional randomized trials with more comprehensive cognitive measures are warranted to definitively assess the efficacy of MBSR for CRCI.This pilot study has important implications for all cancer survivors as it is the first published trial to show that MBSR offers robust and durable improvements in CRCI.

AB  - Study Objective To determine the association between Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score and both cognitive impairment and health care utilization among a diverse ambulatory older adult population. Design Retrospective cohort study. Data Source Medication exposure and other clinical data were extracted from the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS), and cognitive diagnosis was derived from a dementia screening and diagnosis study. Patients A total of 3344 community-dwelling older adults (age 65 yrs and older) who were enrolled in a previously published dementia screening and diagnosis study; of these, 3127 were determined to have no cognitive impairment, and 217 were determined to have cognitive impairment. Measurements and Main Results The study followed a two-phase screening and comprehensive neuropsychiatric examination to determine a cognitive diagnosis, which defined cognitive impairment as dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The ACB scale was used to identify anticholinergics dispensed in the 12 months prior to screening. A total daily ACB score was calculated by using pharmacy dispensing data from RMRS; each anticholinergic was multiplied by 1, 2, or 3 consistent with anticholinergic burden defined by the ACB scale. The sum of all ACB medications was divided by the number of days with any medication dispensed to achieve the total daily ACB score. Health care utilization included visits to inpatient, outpatient, and the emergency department, and it was determined by using visit data from the RMRS. The overall population had a mean age of 71.5 years, 71% were female, and 58% were African American. Each 1-point increase in mean total daily ACB score was associated with increasing risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.004–1.27, p=0.043). Each 1-point increase in mean total daily ACB score increased the likelihood of inpatient admission (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.29, p=0.014) and number of outpatient visits after adjusting for demographic characteristics, number of chronic conditions, and prior visit history (estimate 0.382, standard error [SE] 0.113; p=0.001). The number of visits to the emergency department was also significantly different after similar adjustments (estimate 0.046, SE 0.023, p=0.043). Conclusion Increasing total ACB score was correlated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and more frequent health care utilization. Future work should study interventions that safely reduce ACB and evaluate the impact on brain health and health care costs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Older patients discharged from the emergency department ( ED ) have difficulty comprehending discharge plans and are at high risk of adverse outcomes. The authors investigated whether a postdischarge telephone call–mediated intervention by a nurse would improve discharge care plan adherence, specifically by expediting post– ED visit physician follow‐up appointments and/or compliance with medication changes. The second objectives were to determine if this telephone call intervention would reduce return ED visits and/or hospitalizations within 35 days of the index ED visit and to determine potential cost savings of this intervention. Methods This was a 10‐week randomized, controlled trial among patients aged 65 and older discharged to home from an academic ED . At 1 to 3 days after each patient's index ED visit, a trained nurse called intervention group patients to review discharge instructions and assist with discharge plan compliance; placebo call group patients received a patient satisfaction survey call, while the control group patients were not called. Data collection calls occurred at 5 to 8 days and 30 to 35 days after the index ED visits for all three groups. Chi‐square or Fisher's exact tests were performed for categorical data and the Kruskal‐Wallis test examined group differences in time to follow‐up. Results A total of 120 patients completed the study. Patients were 60% female and 72% white, with a mean age of 75 years (standard deviation [ SD ] ± 7.58 years). Intervention patients were more likely to follow up with medical providers within 5 days of their ED visits than either the placebo or the control group patients (54, 20, and 37%, respectively; p = 0.04). All groups performed well in medication acquisition and comprehension of medication indications and dosage. There were no differences in return visits to the ED or hospital within 35 days of the index ED visit for intervention patients, compared to placebo or control group patients (22, 33, and 27%, respectively; p = 0.41). An economic analysis showed an estimated 70% chance that this intervention would reduce total costs. Conclusions Telephone call follow‐up of older patients discharged from the ED resulted in expedited follow‐up for patients with their primary care physicians. Further study is warranted to determine if these results translate into improved patient outcomes, decreased return ED visits or hospital admissions, and cost savings resulting from this intervention.

AB  - Older adults who visit emergency departments (EDs) often experience delirium, but it is infrequently recognized. A systematic review was therefore conducted to identify what delirium screening tools have been used in ED-based epidemiologic studies of delirium, whether there is a validated set of screening instruments to identify delirium among older adults in the ED or prehospital environments, and an ideal schedule during an older adult's visit to perform a delirium evaluation. MEDLINE/EMBASE, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception through February 2013 for original, English-language research articles reporting on the assessment of older adults' mental status for delirium. Twenty-two articles met all study inclusion criteria. Overall, 7 screening instruments were identified, though only 1 has undergone initial validation for use in the ED environment and a second instrument is currently undergoing such validation. Minimal information was identified to suggest the ideal scheduling of a delirium assessment process to maximize the recognition of this condition in the ED. Study results indicate that several delirium screening tools have been used in investigations in the ED, though validation of these instruments for this particular environment has been minimal to date. The ideal interval(s) during which a delirium screening process should take place has yet to be determined. Research will be needed both to validate delirium screening instruments to be used for investigation and clinical care in the ED and to define the ideal timing and form of the delirium assessment process for older adults.

We conducted a search through February 2013 of MEDLINE/EMBASE from 1946, the Cochrane Library from inception, the PsycINFO database from 1941, and the CINAHL database from 1965. Search terms included the words “delirium” or “acute confusional state” AND “emergency,” “emergency room,” or “emergency department.” We limited the results of the CINAHL and PsycINFO searches to those articles that were peer reviewed. The reference lists of included articles were reviewed by 2 people (M.A.L., a geriatrician, and F.C.M., an emergency physician) to ascertain any further potential studies for inclusion. Additional articles were identified from our own libraries. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines18Moher D. Liberati A. Tetzlaff J. et al.Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement.Ann Intern Med. 2009; 151 (W264): 264-269Scopus (0) Google Scholar for the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, whenever possible. Using the PICOT framework19Rios L.P. Ye C. Thabane L. Association between framing of the research question using the PICOT format and reporting quality of randomized controlled trials.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2010; 10: 11Google Scholar (Table 1), we established study selection criteria before conducting any database searches. This approach required us to name the population, intervention, comparison groups, outcomes, and time frame for articles that would be potentially included in our review. There was no preferred study design type. In brief, articles in English studying the prospective evaluation of patients aged 65 years and older for delirium in the ED or out-of-hospital environments and describing the test characteristics of delirium assessment instruments were eligible. A study member (M.A.L.) reviewed and assessed each title and each abstract evaluated in this article, whereas articles submitted for full review were evaluated by 2 reviewers (M.A.L. and F.C.M.). At title review, articles were excluded if they were clearly not relevant. Articles and abstracts were excluded at later stages from this review for the following reasons: the article did not meet predetermined inclusion criteria, the evaluation of delirium did not occur in the ED or out-of-hospital environment, the article was not in English, or the presented abstract was from a scientific meeting presentation and was not published as a separate, peer-reviewed article.Table 1PICOT criteria and search strategy.CriterionSearch strategyPopulation of interestAged 65 y or above and in the ED or out-of-hospital (ie, EMS) environmentIntervention of interestInclusion: Assessment of mental status for deliriumExclusion: Evaluation takes place outside of ED/out-of-hospital environment or assessment deals with patients who are delirious as a result of illicit drug consumption or ethanol intake/withdrawalComparisonNo comparison group specified or requiredOutcomesAny outcome considered that quantifies delirium presence or developmentTime frameIntervention/assessment performed at any point in the course of the patient's ED stay or in the out-of-hospital environment (under care by EMS)PICOT, Population, intervention, comparison groups, outcomes, and time frame.

Two reviewers (M.A.L. and F.C.M.) abstracted data from each eligible study submitted for full review to a standardized collection instrument, recording study type, population, intervention, comparison group, and results. Additional information was collected about study methodology and whether the study reported on the validation, timing, or application of a delirium screening instrument. Original study authors were contacted, whenever needed, to clarify study details. The 2 reviewers resolved any differences of opinion about which articles to include in the final review, details of data extraction, and quality reviews among themselves through discussion; no residual disagreements required external adjudication. Each study was independently assessed by the 2 reviewers with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.20Guyatt G.H. Oxman A.D. Vist G.E. et al.GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.BMJ. 2008; 336: 924-926Google Scholar Within this framework, articles were determined to provide “grade I”–level evidence if they reported data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with allocation concealment; “grade II”–level evidence if they reported data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial without adequate allocation concealment; “grade III”–level evidence if they presented data from an observational study; and “grade IV”–level evidence if they presented data from a case series or case report. Additionally, among the validation studies, the 2 reviewers independently assessed for bias in reporting of diagnostic test results, using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool21Whiting P.

Fearing M.A. Sternberg E.J. et al.The Confusion Assessment Method: a systematic review of current usage.J Am Geriatr Soc. 2008; 56: 823-830Google Scholar: “adequacy of the reference standard rating (ie, comprehensive assessment for delirium), blinded assessment (ie, no shared information between CAM [Confusion Assessment Method] rater and reference standard), close proximity of assessments between CAM rater and the reference standard assessment (≤8 hours), inclusion of false-positive challenges (eg, dementia, depression, and other psychiatric conditions), and inclusion of false-negative challenges (eg, patients with normal mental status, without psychiatric conditions).” According to this methodology, we assigned 1 point for each met criterion, whereas we allowed one-half point for each partially met criterion. Criteria scores were then combined for each validation study. Any disagreements on scoring were discussed between reviewers until consensus on final criteria scores was achieved. In our initial search of the databases, we identified 2,666 titles (Figure). In this process, we found that the same titles emerged from different sources, suggesting saturation of all available articles. After full review, 22 articles ultimately met all of the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. All of these articles described studies that provided information that addressed the use of screening instruments for delirium identification within the ED, whereas 3 of these articles simultaneously provided information about the optimal timing of a delirium screening process in the ED. Among the articles providing information about the identification of delirium in the ED, 2 were validation studies of a screening instrument in the ED, whereas 20 were application studies of screening tools. Among the reviewed articles, delirium was identified among ED patients with 7 different instruments: the CAM,24Inouye S.K. van Dyck C.H.

The CAM requires raters to assess 9 delirium elements and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. The CAM-ICU is an adaptation of the CAM that includes nonverbal items, requires assessment of 4 cardinal features of delirium, and has been validated in the ICU population. The CAM-ED is another adaptation of the CAM and adds attention tasks to the original CAM instrument. The Organic Brain Syndrome Scale consists of 2 subscales with 15 questions and 39 clinical items. The Delirium Rating Scale requires the completion of a 10-item scale based on all information available to the rater. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale consists of 3 subscales and assesses patients on their cognitive status, observed behavior and performance at tasks, and their “vital status.” The CAM has been used extensively in the ED literature to identify older adults with delirium (Table 2). In these applications, the tool has been used to establish the prevalence of delirium among seniors,5Naughton B.J. Moran M.B.

AB  - Researchers and aid organizations have reported that orphans in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are particularly vulnerable to abuse and neglect. This article is a review of qualitative studies that address experiences of maltreatment among orphaned children and youth living in extended families in SSA. It aims to inform policy and programming by providing a better understanding of the types of maltreatment encountered and the perceived risk factors. A literature search was carried out using Google, PubMed, Scholars Portal Search and Scopus. Searches of relevant bibliographies and publications of authors were also undertaken. Studies from peer-reviewed journals and the grey literature were reviewed for relevance and quality. Eligible studies had to include orphans living with extended family in SSA as participants, explore their maltreatment experiences and employ a sound qualitative methodology. Findings were coded, extracted, compared and synthesized. Twenty articles, representing 15 studies, were selected. These studies, from diverse SSAn countries, reported similar forms of maltreatment among orphaned children and youth: experiences of intra-household discrimination; material and educational neglect; excessive child labour; exploitation by family members and psychological, sexual and physical abuse. The perceived risk factors were poverty, living with a non-biological caregiver, stigma and alcohol abuse. The findings of the included studies suggest that awareness, prevention and intervention initiatives aimed to curb child abuse and neglect within communities in SSA are needed and should be coupled with efforts to promote education and reduce poverty and stigma.

AB  - BACKGROUND Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) has a profound negative impact on quality of life (QOL) for many cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors (BCS) are particularly vulnerable, with up to 70% reporting clinically significant FCR. To the authors' knowledge, evidence-based interventions for managing FCR are limited. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) promotes psychological flexibility in managing life's stressors. The current study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of group-based ACT for FCR in BCS. METHODS Post-treatment BCS (91 patients with stage I-III disease) with clinical FCR randomly were assigned to ACT (6 weekly 2-hour group sessions), survivorship education (SE; 6 weekly 2-hour group sessions), or enhanced usual care (EUC; one 30-minute group coaching session with survivorship readings). FCR severity (primary outcome) and avoidant coping, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, QOL, and other FCR-related variables (secondary outcomes) were assessed at baseline (T1), after the intervention (T2), 1 month after the intervention (T3), and 6 months after the intervention (T4) using intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS Satisfactory recruitment (43.8%) and retention (94.5%) rates demonstrated feasibility. Although each arm demonstrated within-group reductions in FCR severity over time, only ACT produced significant reductions at each time point compared with baseline, with between-group differences at T4 substantially favoring ACT over SE (Cohen d for effect sizes, 0.80; P < .001) and EUC (Cohen d, 0.61; P < .01). For 10 of 12 secondary outcomes, only ACT produced significant within-group reductions across all time points. By T4, significant moderate to large between-group comparisons favored ACT over SE and EUC with regard to avoidant coping, anxiety, depression, QOL, and FCR-related psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS Group-based ACT is a feasible and promising treatment for FCR and associated outcomes in BCS that warrants testing in larger, fully powered trials.

AB  - In Brief Overview Five million Americans require admission to ICUs annually owing to life-threatening illnesses. Recent medical advances have resulted in higher survival rates for critically ill patients, who often have significant cognitive, physical, and psychological sequelae, known as postintensive care syndrome (PICS). This growing population threatens to overwhelm the current U.S. health care system, which lacks established clinical models for managing their care. Novel innovative models are urgently needed. To this end, the pulmonary/critical care and geriatrics divisions at the Indiana University School of Medicine joined forces to develop and implement a collaborative care model, the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC). Its mission is to maximize the cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of ICU survivors. Developed around the principles of implementation and complexity science, the CCRC opened in 2011 as a clinical center with a secondary research focus. Care is provided through a pre-CCRC patient and caregiver needs assessment, an initial diagnostic workup visit, and a follow-up visit that includes a family conference. With its sole focus on the prevention and treatment of PICS, the CCRC represents an innovative prototype aimed at modifying post–critical illness morbidities and improving the ICU survivor's quality of life. The authors describe the creation and implementation of a program aimed at maximizing the cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of ICU survivors.

AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated poor physician adherence to opioid management guidelines in primary care. The objectives of this qualitative study were to understand physicians' and patients' perspectives on recommended opioid management practices and to identify potential barriers to and facilitators of guideline-concordant opioid management in primary care. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 primary care physicians and 26 of their patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. Data were analyzed using a qualitative immersion/crystallization approach. We identified 3 major barriers to and 1 facilitator of use of recommended opioid management practices. Major barriers were inadequate time and resources available; relying on general impressions of risk for opioid misuse; and viewing opioid monitoring as a "law enforcement" activity. The third barrier was most apparent for physicians in the context of drug testing and for patients in the context of opioid agreements. Beliefs about the need to protect patients from opioid-related harm emerged as a major facilitator, especially among patients. We hypothesize that future interventions to improve opioid management in primary care will be more effective if they address identified barriers and use a patient-centered framework, in which prevention of opioid-related harm to patients is emphasized as the primary goal.This article describes primary care perspectives on guideline-recommended opioid management practices. Barriers identified in this study may contribute to underuse of recommended opioid management practices. Consideration of barriers and facilitators to guideline-concordant care could improve effectiveness of future interventions aimed at improving opioid management in primary care.

AB  - To determine the prevalence of self-medication and assess the knowledge, attitudes, and perception of consumers toward self-medication.This cross-sectional survey was conducted over 4 weeks in May 2011 in Riyadh city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Community pharmacies within 5 areas of the city (North, South, West, East, and Middle) were randomly selected for the study. All consumers were approached to participate in the study, with the exception of those buying cosmetic and medicinal equipments. A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data.A total of 538 out of 707 consumers attending community pharmacies in Riyadh city, agreed to participate in the study. Most responders were male (73%), 23-33 years old (35%), and college graduates (42%). A total of 285 medications were bought without a prescription. Of these, 149 (49%) medications should be dispensed by prescription only, and 155 (51%) were over the counter medications. The most common prescription medications dispensed without prescriptions were antibiotics (22%) and analgesics/antipyretics (19%). The most common reasons for buying medications without a prescription were that the symptoms were too minor to visit a doctor (54%), time saving (40%), and minor illnesses for which the participants knew the required treatment (40%). Overall, most participants had poor knowledge, and negative perceptions regarding self-medication. More than 68% of participants did not know whether the medicine they bought is a prescription-only or over the counter medication.Irresponsible self-medication is common in Saudi Arabia. Future studies should focus on improving the consumers' awareness of self-medication and the proper use of medications.

AB  - Self-management practices among patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidity is not well understood. We assessed the effects of a combined pharmacological and behavioural intervention on self-efficacy to manage symptoms and self-management behaviours in patients with pain and comorbid depression.Longitudinal analysis of self-management behaviours and their relationship with outcomes in a 12-month trial of 250 primary care patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid depression. Participants were randomized to either usual care or an intervention that consisted of optimized antidepressant therapy followed by six sessions of a pain self-management (PSM) programme.Participants in the intervention group significantly increased the time spent performing self-management behaviours including strengthening and stretching exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and visualization at 12 months. Moreover, intervention participants reported greater self-efficacy to manage their pain and depression. The number of pain self-management sessions received showed a dose-response relationship with improvement in both pain and depression severity.A combined intervention increased patient self-management behaviours and self-efficacy to manage symptoms among primary care patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression. Receipt of the full dose of the entire PSM programme was related to improvements in pain interference and depression severity. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: A nurse-led six-session PSM programme increased self-efficacy as well as specific behaviours such as strengthening and stretching exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and visualization. There was a dose-response in that attending a greater proportion of the PSM sessions led to greater improvement in both pain and depression outcomes.

AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities. However, there is a paucity of efficacious interventions to address symptom-related suffering and functional interference. Thus, this study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for symptom interference with functioning in MBC patients. Symptomatic MBC patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to six telephone sessions of ACT or six telephone sessions of education/support. Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8 weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility. When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen’s d range = − 0.23 to − 0.31) at 8 and 12 weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range = − 0.03 to 0.07). Additionally, at 12 weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds = − 0.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds = − 0.24 and − 0.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively). Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds = − 0.27 and − 0.28) at 12 weeks post-baseline. Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant. ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Pain catastrophizing has been identified as a prognostic indicator of poor outcome following knee arthroplasty. Interventions to address pain catastrophizing, to our knowledge, have not been tested in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pain coping skills training in persons with moderate to high pain catastrophizing undergoing knee arthroplasty improves outcomes 12 months postoperatively compared with usual care or arthritis education.A multicenter, 3-arm, single-blinded, randomized comparative effectiveness trial was performed involving 5 university-based medical centers in the United States. There were 402 randomized participants. The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Scale, measured at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months following the surgical procedure.Participants were recruited from January 2013 to June 2016. In 402 participants, 66% were women and the mean age of the participants (and standard deviation) was 63.2 ± 8.0 years. Three hundred and forty-six participants (90% of those who underwent a surgical procedure) completed a 12-month follow-up. All 3 treatment groups had large improvements in 12-month WOMAC pain scores with no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the 3 treatment arms. No differences were found between WOMAC pain scores at 12 months for the pain coping skills and arthritis education groups (adjusted mean difference, 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.9 to 1.5]) or between the pain coping and usual-care groups (adjusted mean difference, 0.4 [95% CI, -0.7 to 1.5]). Secondary outcomes also showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the 3 groups.Among adults with pain catastrophizing undergoing knee arthroplasty, cognitive behaviorally based pain coping skills training did not confer pain or functional benefit beyond the large improvements achieved with usual surgical and postoperative care. Future research should develop interventions for the approximately 20% of patients undergoing knee arthroplasty who experience persistent function-limiting pain.Therapeutic Level I.

AB  - To identify the key mechanisms that clinicians perceive improve care in the intensive care unit (ICU), as a result of their involvement in post-ICU programs. Qualitative inquiry via focus groups and interviews with members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine’s THRIVE collaborative sites (follow-up clinics and peer support). Framework analysis was used to synthesize and interpret the data. Five key mechanisms were identified as drivers of improvement back into the ICU: (1) identifying otherwise unseen targets for ICU quality improvement or education programs—new ideas for quality improvement were generated and greater attention paid to detail in clinical care. (2) Creating a new role for survivors in the ICU—former patients and family members adopted an advocacy or peer volunteer role. (3) Inviting critical care providers to the post-ICU program to educate, sensitize, and motivate them—clinician peers and trainees were invited to attend as a helpful learning strategy to gain insights into post-ICU care requirements. (4) Changing clinician’s own understanding of patient experience—there appeared to be a direct individual benefit from working in post-ICU programs. (5) Improving morale and meaningfulness of ICU work—this was achieved by closing the feedback loop to ICU clinicians regarding patient and family outcomes. The follow-up of patients and families in post-ICU care settings is perceived to improve care within the ICU via five key mechanisms. Further research is required in this novel area.

AB  - Abstract Background RNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of how the transcriptome affects disease. However, sequencing technologies often unintentionally introduce experimental error into RNA sequencing data. To counteract this, normalization methods are standardly applied with the intent of reducing the non-biologically derived variability inherent in transcriptomic measurements. However, the comparative efficacy of the various normalization techniques has not been tested in a standardized manner. Here we propose tests that evaluate numerous normalization techniques and applied them to a large-scale standard data set. These tests comprise a protocol that allows researchers to measure the amount of non-biological variability which is present in any data set after normalization has been performed, a crucial step to assessing the biological validity of data following normalization. Results In this study we present two tests to assess the validity of normalization methods applied to a large-scale data set collected for systematic evaluation purposes. We tested various RNASeq normalization procedures and concluded that transcripts per million (TPM) was the best performing normalization method based on its preservation of biological signal as compared to the other methods tested. Conclusion Normalization is of vital importance to accurately interpret the results of genomic and transcriptomic experiments. More work, however, needs to be performed to optimize normalization methods for RNASeq data. The present effort helps pave the way for more systematic evaluations of normalization methods across different platforms. With our proposed schema researchers can evaluate their own or future normalization methods to further improve the field of RNASeq normalization.

AB  - Abstract Objective To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against moderate and severe covid-19 in adults by time since second, third, or fourth doses, and by age and immunocompromised status. Design Test negative case-control study. Setting Hospitals, emergency departments, and urgent care clinics in 10 US states, 17 January 2021 to 12 July 2022. Participants 893 461 adults (≥18 years) admitted to one of 261 hospitals or to one of 272 emergency department or 119 urgent care centers for covid-like illness tested for SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measures The main outcome was waning of vaccine effectiveness with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine during the omicron and delta periods, and the period before delta was dominant using logistic regression conditioned on calendar week and geographic area while adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, local virus circulation, immunocompromised status, and likelihood of being vaccinated. Results 45 903 people admitted to hospital with covid-19 (cases) were compared with 213 103 people with covid-like illness who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls), and 103 287 people admitted to emergency department or urgent care with covid-19 (cases) were compared with 531 168 people with covid-like illness who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was 89% (95% confidence interval 88% to 90%) within two months after dose 3 but waned to 66% (63% to 68%) by four to five months. Vaccine effectiveness of three doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was 83% (82% to 84%) initially but waned to 46% (44% to 49%) by four to five months. Waning was evident in all subgroups, including young adults and individuals who were not immunocompromised; although waning was morein people who were immunocompromised. Vaccine effectiveness increased among most groups after a fourth dose in whom this booster was recommended. Conclusions Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against moderate and severe covid-19 waned with time after vaccination. The findings support recommendations for a booster dose after a primary series and consideration of additional booster doses.

AB  - Although research has suggested that patients desire to participate in shared decision-making, recent studies show that most patients take a passive role in their treatment decisions. The discrepancy between patients' expressed desire and actual behaviors underscores the need to better understand how patients perceive shared decision-making and what factors influence their participation.To investigate patients' preferences and appraisals of their involvement in treatment decisions.Fifty-four qualitative interviews were conducted with veterans receiving outpatient mental health care at a U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.Participants outlined several factors that influence their preferences and involvement in treatment decisions. These include the patient-provider relationship, fear of being judged, perceived inadequacy, and a history of substance abuse.Patients' preferences and willingness to engage in shared decision-making fluctuate over time and are context dependent. A better understanding of these factors and a strong patient-provider relationship will facilitate better measurement and implementation of shared decision-making.

AB  - Research suggests that patient sex, provider sex, and providers' sexist attitudes interact to influence pain care; however, few empirical studies have examined these influences. We investigated sex (patient and provider) differences in pain treatment and the extent to which providers' sexist attitudes were associated with these differences. Ninety-eight health care providers (52% female) completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and made treatment ratings for 16 computer-simulated patients with low back pain. Patient sex was balanced across vignettes. Results indicated that female patients received significantly higher antidepressant (F[1, 96] = 4.51, P < .05, η p 2 = .05) and mental health referral (F[1, 96] = 3.89, P = .05, η p 2 = .04) ratings than male patients, which is consistent with our hypotheses; however, these differences were significant only among female providers. Controlling for providers' sexism scores did not substantially alter these results, which is counter to our hypotheses. These results suggest that female providers are more likely to recommend psychosocial treatments for female than for male pain patients, and providers' sexist attitudes do not account for these differences. Research is needed to elucidate the contributors to sex/gender differences in treatment in order to reduce pain disparities. Perspective The results of this study suggest that patient and provider sex, but not providers' sexist attitudes, influence pain care. These findings may inform efforts to raise awareness of sex/gender differences in pain care and reduce disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Population‐based incidence estimates of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) provide important information for public health policy and resource allocation. We conducted a meta‐analysis of published studies that reported age‐specific incidence rates of dementia and AD to determine whether dementia and AD incidence rates are changing over time. DESIGN PubMed and MEDLINE were searched for publications through June 30, 2017, using key words “dementia”, “Alzheimer”, and “incidence.” Inclusion criteria for the meta‐analysis are: (1) population‐based studies using personal interviews and direct examinations of the study subjects, (2) standardized clinical diagnosis criteria, (3) reporting age‐specific incidence rates, (4) published in English, and (5) sample size of 500 or greater and length of follow‐up of 2 years or greater. Mixed‐effects models were used to determine the association between birth year and incidence rates. MEASUREMENTS Age‐specific dementia/AD incidence rates and their standard errors reported in each study. RESULTS Thirty‐eight articles with 53 cohorts on dementia incidence and 31 articles with 35 cohorts on AD incidence met the inclusion criteria. There were significant associations between later birth years and decreased dementia incidence rates in all three age groups (65‐74, 75‐84, and 85 years and older). There were no significant associations between birth year and AD incident rates in any of the three age groups. In particular, AD incidence rates reported from Western countries stayed steady in all age groups, while studies in non‐Western countries showed significantly increased AD incidence rates for the 65 to 74 years age group (odds ratio = 2.78; P = .04), but a nonsignificant association for the 75 to 84 or 85 years and older groups. CONCLUSION Dementia incidence declined over the past four decades, but AD incidence did not decline. Further research, especially from non‐Western countries, is needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the trends in dementia and AD incidence over time.

AB  - To characterize clinical communication about opioids through direct analysis of clinic visits and in-depth interviews with patients. This was a pilot study of 30 patients with chronic pain, who were audio-recorded in their primary care visits and interviewed after the visit about their pain care and relationship with their physicians. Emergent thematic analysis guided data interpretation. Uncertainties about opioid treatment for chronic pain, particularly addiction and misuse, play an important role in communicating about pain treatment. Three patterns of responding to uncertainty emerged in conversations between patients and physicians: reassurance, avoiding opioids, and gathering additional information. Results are interpreted within the framework of Problematic Integration theory. Although it is well-established that opioid treatment for chronic pain poses numerous uncertainties, little is known about how patients and their physicians navigate these uncertainties. This study illuminates ways in which patients and physicians face uncertainty communicatively and collaboratively. Acknowledging and confronting the uncertainties inherent in chronic opioid treatment are critical communication skills for patients taking opioids and their physicians. Many of the communication behaviors documented in this study may serve as a model for training patients and physicians to communicate effectively about opioids.

The objective of this study was to identify key aspects of chronic pain, cognitions, and psychological distress associated with comorbid PTSD among this sample of Veterans. Baseline data were analyzed from a randomized controlled trial testing a stepped-care intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) Veterans with chronic pain only (n = 173) were compared with those with chronic pain and clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (n = 68). Group differences on pain characteristics, pain cognitions, and psychological distress were evaluated. Results demonstrated that OIF/OEF Veterans with comorbid chronic musculoskeletal pain and PTSD experienced higher pain severity, greater pain-related disability and increased pain interference, more maladaptive pain cognitions (e.g., catastrophizing, self-efficacy, pain centrality), and higher affective distress than those with chronic pain alone. Veterans of recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan may be particularly vulnerable to the compounded adverse effects of chronic pain and PTSD. These results highlight a more intense and disabling pain and psychological experience for those with chronic pain and PTSD than for those without PTSD.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) applications have recently proliferated, especially in low- and middle-income countries, complementing task-redistribution strategies with clinical decision support. Relatively few studies address usability and feasibility issues that may impact success or failure of implementation, and few have been conducted for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension. To conduct iterative usability and feasibility testing of a tablet-based Decision Support and Integrated Record-keeping (DESIRE) tool, a technology intended to assist rural clinicians taking care of hypertension patients at the community level in a resource-limited setting in western Kenya. Usability testing consisted of “think aloud” exercises and “mock patient encounters” with five nurses, as well as one focus group discussion. Feasibility testing consisted of semi-structured interviews of five nurses and two members of the implementation team, and one focus group discussion with nurses. Content analysis was performed using both deductive codes and significant inductive codes. Critical incidents were identified and ranked according to severity. A cause-of-error analysis was used to develop corresponding design change suggestions. Fifty-seven critical incidents were identified in usability testing, 21 of which were unique. The cause-of-error analysis yielded 23 design change suggestions. Feasibility themes included barriers to implementation along both human and technical axes, facilitators to implementation, provider issues, patient issues and feature requests. This participatory, iterative human-centered design process revealed previously unaddressed usability and feasibility issues affecting the implementation of the DESIRE tool in western Kenya. In addition to well-known technical issues, we highlight the importance of human factors that can impact implementation of mHealth interventions.

AB  - To determine the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) and assess their severity and preventability.A prospective cohort study.A 900-bed tertiary academic hospital.A total of 977 patients admitted to two medical, one surgical and two intensive care units over four months.The primary outcomes were the incidence of ADEs, preventability of ADEs, potential ADEs and medication errors. A physician and a clinical pharmacist independently determined the likelihood that incidents were caused by medications and judged severity and preventability.Pharmacists reviewed the medical records of the 977 patients. Pharmacists identified 361 incidents, of which 281 (78%) were considered to be an ADE, potential ADE or medication error by reviewers. The incidence of ADEs was 8.5 per 100 admissions (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.8-10.4), with the highest rate found in the intensive care unit (21.1 per 100 admissions) (95% CI 15.1-28.8). Of all ADEs, 59% were rated as significant, 35% as serious and 6% as life threatening. Thirty percent of ADEs were preventable and 96% of these occurred in the ordering stage. The incidence of potential ADEs was 13.8 per 100 admissions (95% CI 11.5-16.2). Overall, 223 medication errors were identified, 66 (30%) were harmless, 132 (59%) had the potential to cause harm and 25 (11%) resulted in harm.The incidence of ADEs in a Saudi Hospital was 8.5 per 100 admissions. Preventable ADEs most commonly occurred in the ordering stage; therefore, interventions to reduce ADEs should target the ordering stage.

AB  - With the aim of integrating HIV and tuberculosis care in rural Kenya, a team of researchers, clinicians, and technologists used the human-centered design approach to facilitate design, development, and deployment processes of new patient-specific TB clinical decision support system for medical providers. In Kenya, approximately 1.6 million people are living with HIV and have a 20-times higher risk of dying of tuberculosis. Although tuberculosis prevention and treatment medication is widely available, proven to save lives, and prioritized by the World Health Organization, ensuring that it reaches the most vulnerable communities remains challenging. Human-centered design, used in the fields of industrial design and information technology for decades, is an approach to improving the effectiveness and impact of innovations that has been scarcely used in the health field. Using this approach, our team followed a 3-step process, involving mixed methods assessment to (1) understand the situation through the collection and analysis of site observation sessions and key informant interviews; (2) develop a new clinical decision support system through iterative prototyping, end-user engagement, and usability testing; and, (3) implement and evaluate the system across 24 clinics in rural West Kenya. Through the application of this approach, we found that human-centered design facilitated the process of digital innovation in a complex and resource-constrained context.

AB  - Objectives: In a 12-month observational study, we evaluated the effect of opioid use on the outcomes in 1700 adult patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: Data were evaluated using propensity score matching after patients were divided into cohorts based on their baseline medication use: (1) taking an opioid (concurrent use of tramadol was permitted); (2) taking tramadol (but no opioids); and (3) not taking opioids or tramadol. Changes in outcomes were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory for severity and pain-related interference (BPI-S, BPI-I), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ-8), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and economic factors. Time-to-opioid or tramadol discontinuation was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Results: Compared with the opioid cohort, the nonopioid cohort demonstrated significantly greater reductions (P<0.05) in BPI-I, FIQ, PHQ-8, SDS, and ISI; the tramadol cohort compared with the opioid group showed greater reductions on FIQ and ISI. Reductions in BPI-S and GAD-7 did not differ significantly among cohorts. Compared with the opioid cohort, patients in the tramadol cohort had fewer outpatient visits to health care providers. Few significant differences were found between the tramadol and nonopioid cohorts across outcomes. Discussion: Although pain severity was reduced over time in all cohorts, opioid users showed less improvement in pain-related interference with daily living, functioning, depression, and insomnia. Overall, the findings show little support for the long-term use of opioid medications in patients with fibromyalgia given the poorer outcomes across multiple assessment domains associated with this cohort.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with lack of predictive biomarkers. We conducted a study to assess DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations as a predictive biomarker in PDAC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. Experimental Design: Indiana University Simon Cancer Center pancreatic cancer database was used to identify patients with metastatic PDAC, treated with FOLFIRINOX and had tissue available for DNA sequencing. Baseline demographic, clinical, and pathologic information was gathered. DNA isolation and targeted sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq protocol. Overall survival (OS) analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard methods. Multivariate models were adjusted for age, gender, margin status, CA 19-9, adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor and nodal stage. Results: Overall, 36 patients were sequenced. DDR gene mutations were found in 12 patients. Mutations were seen in BRCA1 (N = 7), BRCA2 (N = 5), PALB2 (N = 3), MSH2 (N = 1), and FANCF (N = 1) of all the DDR genes sequenced. Median age was 65.5 years, 58% were male, 97.2% were Caucasian and 51.4% had any family history of cancer. The median OS was near significantly superior in those with DDR gene mutations present vs. absent [14 vs. 5 months; HR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29–1.14; log-rank P = 0.08]. Multivariate logistic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04–2.06; P = 0.04) and Cox regression (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–0.94; P = 0.04) showed presence of DDR gene mutations was associated with improved OS. Conclusions: In a single institution, retrospective study, we found that the presence of DDR gene mutations are associated with improved OS in PDAC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between parental report of intimate partner violence (IPV) and parental psychological distress (PPD) with child attainment of developmental milestones. METHODS: By using data collected from a large cohort of primary care patients, this cross-sectional study examined the relationship between parental report of IPV and/or PPD and the attainment of developmental milestones within the first 72 months of a child’s life. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for parental report of child abuse concern and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Our study population included 16 595 subjects. Children of parents reporting both IPV and PPD (n = 88; 0.5%) were more likely to fail at least 1 milestone across the following developmental domains: language (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–3.3), personal-social (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2–2.9), and gross motor (aOR 3.0; 95% CI 1.8–5.0). Significant associations for those reporting IPV-only (n = 331; 2.0%) were found for language (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.9), personal-social (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4–2.2), and fine motor-adaptive (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0–2.7). Significant associations for those reporting PPD-only (n = 1920; 11.6%) were found for: language (aOR 1.5; 95% CI 1.3–1.7), personal-social (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.5–1.8), gross motor (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4–1.8), and fine-motor adaptive (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3–2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Screening children for IPV and PPD helps identify those at risk for poor developmental outcomes who may benefit from early intervention.

AB  - Self-weighing increases a person's self-awareness of current weight and weight patterns. Increased self-weighing frequency can help an individual prevent weight gain. Literature, however, is limited in describing variability in self-weighing strategies and how the variability is associated with weight management outcomes. This review analyzed self-weighing in weight management interventions and the effects of self-weighing on weight and other outcomes. Twenty-two articles from PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, and Academic Search Premier were extracted for review. These 22 articles reported findings from 19 intervention trials, mostly on weight loss or weight gain prevention. The majority of the reviewed articles reported interventions that combined self-weighing with other self-monitoring strategies (64%), adopted daily self-weighing frequency (84%), and implemented interventions up to six months (59%). One-half of the articles mentioned that technology-enhanced or regular weight scales were given to study participants. Of the articles that provided efficacy data, 75% of self-weighing-only interventions and 67% of combined interventions demonstrated improved weight outcomes. No negative psychological effects were found. Self-weighing is likely to improve weight outcomes, particularly when performed daily or weekly, without causing untoward adverse effects. Weight management interventions could consider including this strategy.

AB  - Poor medication adherence is a major public health problem in older adults often resulting in negative health outcomes. The objective of this review was to provide an updated summary of evidence from randomized controlled studies to determine whether interventions aimed at improving medication adherence also improve the health outcomes of older adults residing in community-based settings. Articles that assessed medication adherence interventions and related health outcomes in elderly individuals were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1970–June 2016), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through to June 2016), and Google Scholar. Across the 12 included studies, interventions were grouped into three main categories: behavioral/educational (n = 3), pharmacist-led (n = 7), and reminder/simplification (n = 2). Among the behavioral/educational intervention studies, two showed improvements in both adherence and related health outcomes, whereas one found no changes in adherence or health outcomes. Among the pharmacist-led studies, three showed improvements in both adherence and related health outcomes, while three reported no changes in adherence or health outcomes. One found an improvement in adherence but not health outcomes. Among the reminder/simplification studies, both studies reported improvements in adherence without a significant impact on related health outcomes. This evidence-based review of medication adherence interventions in older adults revealed promising strategies in the larger context of a largely mixed body of literature. Future patient-centered and multidisciplinary interventions should be developed and tested using evidence-based principles to improve medication adherence and health outcomes in older adults.

AB  - Nursing homes are an important site for end-of-life care, yet little is known about the perspectives of the frontline staff who provide a majority of this care.To describe, from the staff perspective, positive/negative experiences related to caring for dying residents.Qualitative analysis using survey data from staff working in 52 Indiana nursing homes.A total of 707 frontline staff who provide nursing, nurse aide, and social work services responded to open-ended prompts. Study data included responses to open-ended prompts asking participants to describe one positive experience and one negative experience caring for a dying patient. A thematic content analysis was conducted using the constant-comparative method. Respondents were largely female (93%), white (78%), 31-50 years (42%), and 53% had >5 years of nursing home work experience. Experiences were described from three perspectives: 1) first-hand experiences, 2) observed experiences of dying patients, and 3) observed experiences of family members. Selected themes for positive experiences include the following: creating close bonds; good patient care; involvement of hospice; being prepared; and good communication. Selected themes for negative experiences consisted of the following: challenging aspects of care; unacknowledged death; feeling helpless; uncertainty; absent family; painful emotions; and family discord.Findings reveal the richness and many complexities of providing end-of-life care in nursing homes and have implications for improving staff knowledge, coordination of care with hospice, and social support for patients.

AB  - The Aging Brain Care (ABC) Medical Home aims to improve the care, health outcomes, and medical costs of Medicare beneficiaries with dementia or depression across central Indiana. This population health management program, funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center, expanded an existing collaborative dementia and depression care program to serve 1,650 older adults in a local safety-net hospital system. During the first year, 20 full-time clinical staff were hired, trained, and deployed to deliver a collaborative care intervention. In the first 18 months, an average of 13 visits was provided per person. Thirty percent of the sample had a diagnosis of dementia, and 77% had a diagnosis of depression. Sixty-six percent of participants with high depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥14) had at least a 50% reduction in their depressive symptoms. Fifty-one percent of caregivers of individuals with dementia had at least a 50% reduction in caregiver stress symptoms (measured by the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor-Caregiver Version). After 18 months, the ABC Medical Home has demonstrated progress toward improving the health of older adults with dementia and depression. Scalable and practical models like this show initial promise for answering the challenges posed by the nation's rapidly aging population.

AB  - Productive patient-clinician communication is an important component of effective pain management, but we know little about how patients and clinicians actually talk about pain in clinical settings and how it might be improved to produce better patient outcomes. The objective of this review was to create a conceptual model of patient-clinician communication about noncancer pain, review and synthesize empirical research in this area, and identify priorities for future research.A conceptual model was developed that drew on existing pain and health communication research. CINAHL, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched to find studies reporting empirical data on patient-clinician communication about noncancer pain; results were supplemented with manual searches. Studies were categorized and analyzed to identify crosscutting themes and inform model development.The conceptual model comprised the following components: contextual factors, clinical interaction, attitudes and beliefs, and outcomes. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed based on model components. Studies varied widely in quality, methodology, and sample size. Two provisional conclusions were identified: contrary to what is often reported in the literature, discussions about analgesics are most frequently characterized by patient-clinician agreement, and self-presentation during patient-clinician interactions plays an important role in communication about pain and opioids.Published studies on patient-clinician communication about noncancer pain are few and diverse. The conceptual model presented here can help to identify knowledge gaps and guide future research on communication about pain. Investigating the links between communication and pain-related outcomes is an important priority for future research.

The cohorts consist of 1440 African-Americans, 1774 Yoruba in 1992 and 1835 African-Americans and 1895 Yoruba in the 2001 cohorts aged ≥70 years.In African-Americans, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence rates were significantly lower in 2001 than 1992 for all age groups except the oldest group. The overall standardized annual dementia incidence rates were 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2%-4.1%) in the 1992 cohort and 1.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-1.7%) in the 2001 cohort. There was no significant difference in dementia or AD incidence between the Yoruba cohorts.Future research is needed to explore the reasons for the differential changes in incidence rates in these two populations.

AB  - Hospital systems increasingly utilize pharmacogenomic testing to inform clinical prescribing. Successful implementation efforts have been modeled at many academic centers. In contrast, this report provides insights into the formation of a pharmacogenomics consultation service at a safety-net hospital, which predominantly serves low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable populations. The report describes the INdiana GENomics Implementation: an Opportunity for the UnderServed (INGENIOUS) trial and addresses concerns of adjudication, credentialing, and funding.

AB  - Abstract Objective To develop an empirically derived taxonomy of clinical decision support (CDS) alert malfunctions. Materials and Methods We identified CDS alert malfunctions using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods: (1) site visits with interviews of chief medical informatics officers, CDS developers, clinical leaders, and CDS end users; (2) surveys of chief medical informatics officers; (3) analysis of CDS firing rates; and (4) analysis of CDS overrides. We used a multi-round, manual, iterative card sort to develop a multi-axial, empirically derived taxonomy of CDS malfunctions. Results We analyzed 68 CDS alert malfunction cases from 14 sites across the United States with diverse electronic health record systems. Four primary axes emerged: the cause of the malfunction, its mode of discovery, when it began, and how it affected rule firing. Build errors, conceptualization errors, and the introduction of new concepts or terms were the most frequent causes. User reports were the predominant mode of discovery. Many malfunctions within our database caused rules to fire for patients for whom they should not have (false positives), but the reverse (false negatives) was also common. Discussion Across organizations and electronic health record systems, similar malfunction patterns recurred. Challenges included updates to code sets and values, software issues at the time of system upgrades, difficulties with migration of CDS content between computing environments, and the challenge of correctly conceptualizing and building CDS. Conclusion CDS alert malfunctions are frequent. The empirically derived taxonomy formalizes the common recurring issues that cause these malfunctions, helping CDS developers anticipate and prevent CDS malfunctions before they occur or detect and resolve them expediently.

AB  - Acceptance of cancer has long been recognized as playing a critical role in psychological adjustment to the illness, but its associations with distress outcomes have not been quantitatively reviewed. Informed by coping theory and third wave conceptualizations of acceptance, we first propose an integrated model of acceptance of cancer. Then we examine the strength of the relationships between acceptance of cancer and general and cancer-specific distress in cancer patients and potential moderators of these relationships. CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Web of Science databases were searched. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on 78 records (N = 15,448). Small-to-moderate, negative, and significant relationships were found between acceptance of cancer and general distress (r = −0.31; 95% CI: −0.36 to −0.26, k = 75); cancer-specific distress (r = −0.18; 95% CI: −0.21 to −0.14, k = 13); depressive symptoms (r = −0.25; 95% CI: −0.31 to −0.19, k = 41); and anxiety symptoms (r = −0.22; 95% CI: −0.30 to −0.15, k = 29). Age, marital status, and stage of cancer were identified as significant moderators. Findings suggest that acceptance of cancer may be important to target in interventions to reduce general and cancer-specific distress in cancer patients. Future research should focus on developing multifaceted measures of acceptance and identifying theory-based psychological and social processes that lead to greater acceptance.

AB  - ContextAdvanced lung cancer patients typically have a poor prognosis and many symptoms that interfere with functioning, contributing to high rates of emotional distress in both patients and family caregivers. There remains a need for evidence-based interventions to improve functional outcomes and distress in this population.ObjectivesThis pilot trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and their distressed family caregivers. Primary outcomes were patient symptom interference with functioning and patient and caregiver distress.MethodsSymptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and distressed caregivers (n = 50 dyads) were randomly assigned to six sessions of ACT or an education/support condition. Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and breathlessness. Patients and caregivers completed measures of distress and illness acceptance and struggle.ResultsThe eligibility screening rate (51%) and retention rate (76% at six weeks postintervention) demonstrated feasibility. No group differences were found with respect to patient and caregiver outcomes. Both groups showed a small, significant decrease in struggle with the illness over the study period, but did not show meaningful change in other outcomes.ConclusionFindings suggest that telephone-based ACT is feasible for many advanced lung cancer patients and caregivers, but may not substantially reduce symptom interference and distress. Low baseline levels of certain symptoms may have contributed to null findings. Next steps include applying ACT to specific, clinically meaningful symptom interference and varying intervention dose and modality.

AB  - As more and more electronic clinical information is becoming easier to access for secondary uses such as clinical research, approaches that enable faster and more collaborative research while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality are becoming more important. Clinical text de-identification offers such advantages but is typically a tedious manual process. Automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods can alleviate this process, but their impact on subsequent uses of the automatically de-identified clinical narratives has only barely been investigated. In the context of a larger project to develop and investigate automated text de-identification for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical notes, we studied the impact of automated text de-identification on clinical information in a stepwise manner. Our approach started with a high-level assessment of clinical notes informativeness and formatting, and ended with a detailed study of the overlap of select clinical information types and Protected Health Information (PHI). To investigate the informativeness (i.e., document type information, select clinical data types, and interpretation or conclusion) of VHA clinical notes, we used five different existing text de-identification systems. The informativeness was only minimally altered by these systems while formatting was only modified by one system. To examine the impact of de-identification on clinical information extraction, we compared counts of SNOMED-CT concepts found by an open source information extraction application in the original (i.e., not de-identified) version of a corpus of VHA clinical notes, and in the same corpus after de-identification. Only about 1.2–3% less SNOMED-CT concepts were found in de-identified versions of our corpus, and many of these concepts were PHI that was erroneously identified as clinical information. To study this impact in more details and assess how generalizable our findings were, we examined the overlap between select clinical information annotated in the 2010 i2b2 NLP challenge corpus and automatic PHI annotations from our best-of-breed VHA clinical text de-identification system (nicknamed ‘BoB’). Overall, only 0.81% of the clinical information exactly overlapped with PHI, and 1.78% partly overlapped. We conclude that automated text de-identification’s impact on clinical information is small, but not negligible, and that improved clinical acronyms and eponyms disambiguation could significantly reduce this impact.

AB  - Measurement-based care is an evidence-based practice for depression that efficiently identifies treatment non-responders and those who might otherwise deteriorate [1]. However, measurement-based care is underutilized in community mental health with data suggesting fewer than 20 % of behavioral health providers using this practice to inform treatment. It remains unclear whether standardized or tailored approaches to implementation are needed to optimize measurement-based care fidelity and penetration. Moreover, there is some suggestion that prospectively tailored interventions that are designed to fit the dynamic context may optimize public health impact, though no randomized trials have yet tested this notion [2]. This study will address the following three aims: (1) To compare the effect of standardized versus tailored MBC implementation on clinician-level and client-level outcomes; (2) To identify contextual mediators of MBC fidelity; and (3) To explore the impact of MBC fidelity on client outcomes.This study is a dynamic cluster randomized trial of standardized versus tailored measurement-based care implementation in Centerstone, the largest provider of community-based mental health services in the USA. This prospective, mixed methods implementation-effectiveness hybrid design allows for evaluation of the two conditions on both clinician-level (e.g., MBC fidelity) and client-level (depression symptom change) outcomes. Central to this investigation is the focus on identifying contextual factors (e.g., attitudes, resources, process, etc.) that mediate MBC fidelity and optimize client outcomes.This study will contribute generalizable and practical strategies for implementing systematic symptom monitoring to inform and enhance behavioral healthcare.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02266134 .

AB  - Shared decision making is a fundamental component of patient-centered care and has been linked to positive health outcomes. Increasingly, researchers are turning their attention to shared decision making in mental health; however, few studies have explored decision making in these settings from patients' perspectives. We examined patients' accounts and understanding of shared decision making. We analyzed interviews from 54 veterans receiving outpatient mental health care at a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the United States. Although patients' understanding of shared decision making was consistent with accounts published in the literature, participants reported that shared decision making goes well beyond these components. They identified the patient-provider relationship as the bedrock of shared decision making and highlighted several factors that interfere with shared decision making. Our findings highlight the importance of the patient-provider relationship as a fundamental element of shared decision making and point to areas for potential improvement.

SDB was categorized according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): none (AHI < 5), mild (5 ≥ AHI < 15), and moderate-severe (AHI ≥ 15). Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias consisted of: (1) complex ventricular ectopy, (CVE: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy), (2) combined supraventricular tachycardia, (CST: atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia), (3) intraventricular conduction delay (ICD), (4) tachyarrhythmias (ventricular and supraventricular), and (5) any cardiac arrhythmia. Unadjusted, adjusted logistic regression, and Cochran-Armitage testing examined the association between SDB and cardiac arrhythmias. Linear regression models explored the association between hypoxia, arousals, and cardiac arrhythmias.Results:Compared to those without SDB, patients with moderate-severe SDB had almost three-fold unadjusted odds of any cardiac arrhythmia (2.94; CI 95%, 2.01–4.30; p < 0.0001), two-fold odds of tachyarrhythmias (2.16; CI 95%,1.47–3.18; p = 0.0011), two-fold odds of CVE (2.01; 1.36–2.96; p = 0.003), and two-fold odds of ICD (2.50; 1.58–3.95; p = 0.001). A linear trend was identified between SDB severity and all cardiac arrhythmia subtypes (p value linear trend < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, BMI, gender, and cardiovascular diseases, moderate-severe SDB patients had twice the odds of having nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias (2.24; 1.48–3.39; p = 0.004). Frequency of obstructive respiratory events and hypoxia were strong predictors of arrhythmia risk.Conclusions:SDB is independently associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk for any cardiac arrhythmia.Citation:Selim BJ, Koo BB, Qin L, Jeon S, Won C, Redeker NS, Lampert RJ, Concato JP, Bravata DM, Ferguson J, Strohl K, Bennett A, Zinchuk A, Yaggi HK. The association between nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and sleep-disordered breathing: the DREAM study. J Clin Sleep Med 2016;12(6):829–837.INTRODUCTIONSleep-disordered breathing (SDB) affects 17% of adults in the general U.S. population.1 The prevalence of SDB among U.S. veterans is estimated to be as high as four times that of the general population due to major risk factors for SDB that are common among veterans, including male gender, increasing age, smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular comorbidity.2 SDB has been linked to a number of cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden death.3–6 Importantly, a circadian pattern has been observed in the occurrence of sudden death in SDB, such that the risk for sudden death doubles from midnight to 6 AM among patients with SDB compared to those without.5 A putative association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias may, in part, explain this increased risk for nocturnal sudden death.7,8BRIEF SUMMARYCurrent Knowledge/Study Rationale: The association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and cardiac arrhythmias has been examined in community-based with self-reported morbidities but not in clinic-based populations that tend to have more severe sleep-disordered breathing and higher rates of cardiovascular comorbidity.Study Impact: The association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia may, in part, explain the observed increased risk in nocturnal sudden death among patients with sleep apnea. Understanding the nature of the association between sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmias also has the potential to change the practice of polysomnographic interpretation, leading to a more systematic approach to the detection and quantifications of cardiac events.SDB is associated with a number of physiologic perturbations that may plausibly increase the risk of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias including: repetitive episodes hypoxia and nocturnal sympathetic hyperactivity which in turn have been associated with ventricular ectopy, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.7,9 Additionally, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common form of SDB consisting of repetitive upper airway obstruction, leads to significant intrathoracic pressure swings contributing to increased atrial and ventricular cardiac wall stress. This increase in ventricular afterload will predispose to transient acute ischemia in the short term and to cardiac remodeling in the long term, increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias.10–12Surprisingly, few studies have been conducted to clarify the association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias. Data are limited regarding the magnitude of risk from clinic-based populations who tend to have multiple cardiovascular comorbidities and more severe SDB than population-based studies. We analyzed data from a clinic-based prospective observational cohort of veterans to further understand the relationship between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia. Our objective was to determine whether SDB is independently associated nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and whether increasing severity of SDB is associated with an increasing risk of these events. As a secondary analysis, we explored which selected polysomnographic (PSG) measures of SDB best predict risk of arrhythmias.METHODSSubjects/Study DesignThe study sample was derived from a parent prospective observational cohort study named the Determining Risk of vascular Events by Apnea Monitoring (DREAM) study. The rationale and methods of this parent study has been previously published.13 In this study, 1,840 patients underwent comprehensive sleep testing for SDB at 3 VA medical centers (VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT; Richard L. Rhoudebush VAMC, Indianapolis, IN; Louis Stokes VAMC, Cleveland, OH) and were followed for cardiovascular outcomes. The current study is a cross-sectional analysis of the first 982 consecutive veteran patients referred for PSG, a subgroup of DREAM patients who also underwent additional detailed cardiac arrhythmia evaluation. Subjects were excluded if diagnostic PSG data were < 2 h duration, referral for PSG was for reasons other than suspected sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., narcolepsy or movement disorder), or referral was for therapeutic PSG study only (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure titration). The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee at all 3 VA medical centers.Polysomnographic Data CollectionRaw PSG data were acquired at the 3 clinical centers, processed, and rescored by trained polysomnologists at a central reading center at the Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, West Haven, CT. The PSG montage included recording of electroencephalogram (F3/4-M1, C3/4-M1, O1/2-M1), bilateral electro-oculogram, submental, and anterior tibialis electromyo-gram, electrocardiogram (a single modified electrocardiograph lead II, sampled at 500 Hz), nasal pressure transduction, oronasal thermistry, thoracic and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography, and a finger probe for oxygen saturation (sampling frequency of 25 Hz). Apneas were defined by a decrease of peak thermal sensor ≥ 90% of baseline for ≥ 10 s, and were classified as obstructive or central, if respiratory effort was present or absent, respectively. Mixed apneas were scored when apneas were associated with absent inspiratory effort in the initial portion of the event, followed by resumption of inspiratory effort in the second portion of the event. Hypopneas were defined as a nasal pressure drop > 30% from baseline, lasting ≥ 10 s, and associated with oxygen desaturation ≥ 4%.14 The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was enumerated as the sum of all apneas and hypopneas divided by total sleep time in hours. Participants were categorized according to severity of SDB by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): (1) no SDB (AHI < 5); (2) mild SDB (5 ≤ AHI < 15); and (3) moderate-severe SDB (AHI ≥ 15). The obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) is defined as the number of apneas (obstructive and mixed) and hypopneas per hour of sleep. Time spent below 90% of oxygen saturation (T < 90%) represented the percentage of the total sleep time spent below 90% oxygen saturation. Oxygen desaturation index 4% (ODI 4%) was described as the number of oxygen desaturations ≥ 4% per hour of sleep. Finally, arousals were scored when an abrupt shift of EEG frequency occurred (including alpha, theta, or frequencies > 16 Hz) for ≥ 3 s, with ≥ 10 s of preceding stable sleep. Scoring arousals during REM sleep required additional increases in submental electromyogram (EMG) lasting at least one second.14,15 Arousal index represented the number of respiratory and nonrespiratory arousals per hour of sleep.Cardiac Arrhythmia OutcomesRaw data from PSG studies were exported into European Data Files (EDF), a standard file format designed for exchange and storage of biological time series data. The PSG electrocardiogram (ECG) data and the respiratory wave forms from these files were analyzed by Somte ECG interpretation software (Somte, Compumedics). This software displayed the electrocardiographic tracing of the comprehensive sleep study in a “Holter-type” visual format, allowing manual as well as an automatic ECG analysis, including QRS complex classification, and arrhythmia detection/classification.All ECG data were reviewed manually for specific arrhythmia types; events were quantified, and categorized by one of the investigators (BJS), blinded to respiratory events and clinical data, with arbitration by a cardiac electrophysiologist (RL) when necessary. Categories included supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias and conduction delay arrhythmias. Supraventricular arrhythmias included: (1) premature atrial contraction (PAC ≥ 5 events per hour, measured in studies without atrial fibrillation); (2) atrial fibrillation or flutter (occurring intermittently or continuously); (3) supraventricular tachycardia, and (4) and a composite variable of combined supraventricular tachycardia (combination of atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia, excluding PACs). Ventricular arrhythmias included: (1) isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVC ≥ 5 events/h); (2) bigeminy/trigeminy/ quadrigeminy; (3) nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; and (4) a composite variable of complex ventricular ectopy (i.e., bigeminy, trigeminy, quadrigeminy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, excluding isolated PVCs). Conduction delay arrhythmias included: (1) sinus pause (> 3 s), (2) second degree atrioventricular block, (3) third degree atrioventricular block, (4) intraventricular conduction delay (QRS > 120 msec), and (5) tachyarrhythmia (ventricular or supraventricular). Finally, any nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias included the following arrhythmias: complex ventricular ectopy, or combined supraventricular tachycardia, or intraventricular conduction delay.Covariate Data CollectionA number of clinical variables were collected at baseline: (1) demographic and anthropometric variables included age, gender, race, body mass index; (2) cardiovascular disease risk factors included diabetes, hypertension, (determined by either physician diagnosis or receiving appropriate medication), smoking history (≥ 20 pack year history), high density lipo-protein levels (HDL), and low density lipoprotein levels; and (3) cardiovascular diseases included stroke, angina, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator.Statistical AnalysisBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were described using mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables, and frequency counts for categorical variables. ANOVA testing was used to compare mean values, and χ2 testing to compare frequency of categorical values across SDB severity groups. Kruskal-Wallis testing was used to compare median polysomnographic values among groups. All subtypes of arrhythmias were analyzed as dichotomous variables. We used Cochran-Armitage testing for linear trend to examine whether increased severity of SDB is associated with increased risk of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.We used logistic regression analysis to examine the association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias subtypes (dichotomous outcome). Multivariable adjustment in a forward stepwise modeling approach was first used with demographic variables, adding later cardiovascular risk factors, followed by cardiovascular diseases.Finally, as a secondary analysis, we examined the association between selected polysomnographic measures of sleep-disordered breathing and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias using linear regression models.Assuming an estimated arrhythmia prevalence of 40% in the reference group (patients without SDB), the study had more than 95% power to detect a minimum of 20% increase in prevalence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias in our sample size (PASS software, 2008). All the analyses were performed using the SAS (9.2 version) statistical package, and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSAfter screening 982 consecutive veteran patients referred for PSG between 2000 and 2004, 697 patients fulfilled these inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). Among these 697 participants; 94.5% were male and 79.1% Caucasian with a mean age of 58.7 ± 12.1 years. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of patients without SDB (reference group), with mild SDB, and with moderate-severe SDB. As expected, increasing age, BMI, and male gender, were associated with increase severity of SDB. Diabetes mellitus, lower levels of high-density lipoproteins, and smoking tended to have increased prevalence in patients with more severe SDB. The distribution of prevalent cardiovascular diseases (such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, stroke, and congestive heart failure) did not vary significantly among patients with and without sleep apnea.Figure 1: Consort patient flow diagram.Download FigureTable 1 baseline characteristics by sleep-disordered breathing severity.Table 1 baseline characteristics by sleep-disordered breathing severity.Table 2 demonstrates that nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia is common in this clinic-based population, affecting 58.5% (n = 86) of patients with mild SDB and 65.6% (n = 256) of patients with moderate-severe SDB, compared to 39.4% (n = 63) of those without SDB. Subjects with moderate-severe SDB had almost 3 times the unadjusted risk of any cardiac arrhythmias (OR 2.94; CI 95%, 2.01–4.30), 2-fold risk of tachyarrhythmias (OR 2.16; CI 95%,1.47–3.18; p = 0.0011), 2 times the risk of complex ventricular ectopy (OR 2.01; CI 95%, 1.36–2.96; p = 0.002), 4 times the risk of combined supraventricular tachycardia (OR 4.21; CI 95%, 1.48–12.00; p = 0.03), and 2 times the risk of intraventricular conduction delay (OR 2.50; CI 95%, 1.58–3.95; p = 0.001). Within these subtypes of arrhythmias, a nonsignificant trend towards a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation was observed among patients with moderate-severe SDB than those without SDB. The frequency of any cardiac arrhythmias and each individual sub-type of arrhythmia (complex ventricular ectopy, combined supraventricular tachycardia, and intraventricular conduction delay) was greater with increasing SDB severity (p for linear trend, < 0.0001; Figure 2)Table 2 Unadjusted association of sleep-disordered breathing (categorized by severity) with cardiac arrhythmias.Table 2 Unadjusted association of sleep-disordered breathing (categorized by severity) with cardiac arrhythmias.Figure 2: Unadjusted association of sleep-disordered breathing (categorized by severity) with cardiac arrhythmias.*Tachyarrhythmia is defined as ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia. † Complex ventricular ectopy (CVE) is defined as bigeminy or trigeminy or quadrigeminy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. ‡ Combined supraventricular tachycardia (CST) is defined as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia. ICD, intraventricular conduction delay.Download FigureAs shown in Table 3, after adjusting for several domains of covariates (demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardiovascular disease), patients with moderate-severe SDB had twice the odds of having any cardiac arrhythmias (OR 2.24; CI 95% 1.48–3.40; p = 0.004). The association between moderate-severe SDB category and cardiac arrhythmia persisted for some but not all types of arrhythmia. For example, patients with moderate-severe SDB had twice the odds of intraventricular conduction delay (OR 2.39; CI 95% 1.44- 3.97; p = 0.007). Adjusting for the same covariates, patients with mild SDB had 4 times the odds of having combined supraventricular arrhythmia (OR 4.39; CI 95% 1.19–16.13; p = 0.039), in comparison to those without SDB. There were significant linear trends for the association between sleep-disordered severity and any cardiac arrhythmia as well as with intraventricular conduction delay. (Figure 3)Table 3 Adjusted model of association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.Table 3 Adjusted model of association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.Figure 3: Adjusted model of association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.Adjusted for: age, BMI, gender, cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors (hypertension, smoking status, diabetes, fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL cholesterol), CVD disease (angina, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, pacemaker, history of CABG, and PCI). *Tachyarrhythmia is defined as ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia. ICD, intraventricular conduction delay.Download FigureTable 4 describes a secondary analysis examining the association between selected polysomnographic measures of SDB and their association with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias. SDB as measured by the overall AHI was the strongest predictor of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias, such that the risk of nocturnal arrhythmias increased by 10% per every 10-unit increase in AHI (OR 1.10; CI 95% 1.04–1.15; p = 0.0005). Obstructive respiratory events were stronger predictors of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias than were central respiratory events. Finally, various measures of hypoxemia (i.e., ODI, lowest oxygen saturation) were significantly associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias, whereas the measure of arousal from sleep was not.Table 4 Selected polysomnographic measures of SDB and their association with any cardiac arrhythmia.Table 4 Selected polysomnographic measures of SDB and their association with any cardiac arrhythmia.DISCUSSIONUsing laboratory-based, objective measures of SDB, combined with a comprehensive method to ascertain nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias, we observed an independent association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias after adjusting for relevant clinical variables. Increasing severity of SDB, using common clinical cut-points, was associated with an increased risk of all three subtypes of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias; supraventricular, ventricular, and conduction delay. Obstructive respiratory events were stronger predictors of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias than were central respiratory events. Various measures of hypoxemia (i.e., ODI, lowest oxygen saturation) were significantly associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia, whereas the arousal index, a measure of arousal from sleep (and presumably sympathetic activity), was not. These associations were found in a sleep clinic-based population of U.S. veterans at risk of having both SDB and cardiac arrhythmias.Our results are consistent with the small number of previous studies in this domain that have demonstrated a strong and independent association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.9,16,17 In addition, our study adds to the current understanding of SDB and arrhythmias in several important ways. First, we targeted a clinic-based population, which is likely more representative of patients referred for sleep testing. Second, we accounted for numerous cardiovascular risk factors, as well as established cardiovascular disease. Third, we observed a strong dose-response relationship between increasing severity of SDB, using accepted clinical cut-points and the three main subtypes of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia: supraventricular, ventricular, and conduction delay. Finally, we observed that obstructive respiratory events, rather than central respiratory events, and measures of hypoxia, rather than arousal, were stronger predictors of nocturnal arrhythmia risk.Limited research has characterized the association between SDB and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias. One of the first studies to examine the SDB-arrhythmia relationship reported that 193 of 400 patients with severe OSA demonstrated cardiac arrhythmias (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, sinus arrest, and second-degree atrioventricular conduction block) after evaluation by PSG and 24-h Holter monitoring. In that study, only patients with severe OSA were included; no reference group was used, and analyses did not adjust for potential confounders.16 Comparing patients with severe SDB to those with no SDB, a previous analysis from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) demonstrated an association between severe SDB and prevalent nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias.17 A subsequent study, by the same investigators, using data from the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men (MrOS Sleep), focused specifically on atrial fibrillation and complex ventricular ectopy. The results suggested that central respiratory events had more significant association with atrial fibrillation, whereas obstructive respiratory events had a stronger linkage with ventricular arrhythmias.9 As these were population-based studies, they tended to include participants with less severe SDB and fewer cardiovascular comorbidities. Our results in large part are consistent with these previous findings, but show association between OSA and arrhythmia in a U.S. veteran population with high cardiovascular comorbidity rates.Hypoxia has a complex association with cardiac arrhythmias. Chronic intermittent hypoxia may be cardio-protective and associated with “preconditioning,” while acute intermittent hypoxia could be pro-arrhythmogenic by inducing release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by increasing sympathetic nerve activity.18–23 In line with these mechanisms, our findings suggest that hypoxia frequency (ODI 4%) was associated with increased nocturnal arrhythmias. Mechanistically, intermittent hypoxia in OSA patients may directly cause ventricular ectopy by inducing the release of ROS, which pathologically stimulate cardiac ion channels and predispose to arrhythmia.24There are other potential mechanisms why arrhythmia may arise in the presence of OSA. During an obstructive apnea, inspiratory effort against a collapsed upper airway generates negative intrathoracic force on the order of −60 mm Hg,25,26 stimulating cardiac mechanoreceptors and increasing cardiac transmural pressure, thereby predisposing to arrhythmia.27–29 Negative intrathoracic pressure has been shown to increase supraventricular premature beats and also to prolong the QTc interval, which in turn may explain the increased risk of dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.30–32At the same time, the frequent co-stimulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems during sleep-disordered breathing may predispose to atrial arrhythmia.33 Atrial fibrillation (AF), in particular, has been associated with OSA.34 Experimental manipulations of the autonomic nervous system perturb the electrical system of the atrium, shortening the effective refractory period, increasing heterogeneity of conduction and repolarization, facilitating atrial fibrillation.33,35 Ambulatory monitoring studies analyzing heart rate variability have also shown a primary adrenergic increase followed by a vagal response may precede atrial arrhythmia supporting this concept.36Despite the well documented association of AF with SDB, our study showed a non-significant trend towards a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence of AF among patients with moderate-severe SDB in comparison to those without SDB. This finding could be explained by the small representation of patients with predominant central sleep apnea (CAI > 50% of total AHI) in our SDB group (16 of 537 patients), and the finding in previous studies that prevalent AF is more highly associated with central rather than obstructive sleep apnea.9Regarding conduction delay arrhythmias, the prevalence of sinus pauses, atrioventricular block, and asystole has been reported in up to 18% in patients with SDB, in comparison to just 3% among a healthy population.16 In OSA patients, the occurrence of conduction delay arrhythmias has been associated with OSA severity, the extent of hypoxemia, and REM sleep.37,38 Our study found a significant relationship of hypoxemia with frequency of intraventricular conduction delay. Other studies have yielded different results. Mehra et al. reported no significant difference in conduction delay arrhythmia between individuals with SDB and those without.17,39 This difference in observational data may be explained by difference in study design and study population, as well as degree of oxygen desaturation. Mechanistically, the combination of an apneic event and hypoxemia are necessary to trigger a vagally mediated apneic arrhythmia.37,38,40Our study has several strengths, including: (1) a detailed individually scored full in-laboratory polysomnography with coding and abstraction of various measures of hypoxia, arousals, and sleep architecture; (2) a rigorous, standardized collection of demographic information, cardiovascular risk factors, and established cardiovascular disease, with l

AB  - Abstract Background Implementation of multifaceted interventions typically involves many diverse elements working together in interrelated ways, including intervention components, implementation strategies, and features of local context. Given this real-world complexity, implementation researchers may be interested in a new mathematical, cross-case method called Coincidence Analysis (CNA) that has been designed explicitly to support causal inference, answer research questions about combinations of conditions that are minimally necessary or sufficient for an outcome, and identify the possible presence of multiple causal paths to an outcome. CNA can be applied as a standalone method or in conjunction with other approaches and can reveal new empirical findings related to implementation that might otherwise have gone undetected. Methods We applied CNA to a publicly available dataset from Sweden with county-level data on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaigns and vaccination uptake in 2012 and 2014 and then compared CNA results to the published regression findings. Results The original regression analysis found vaccination uptake was positively associated only with the availability of vaccines in schools. CNA produced different findings and uncovered an additional solution path: high vaccination rates were achieved by either (1) offering the vaccine in all schools or (2) a combination of offering the vaccine in some schools and media coverage. Conclusions CNA offers a new comparative approach for researchers seeking to understand how implementation conditions work together and link to outcomes.

AB  - This article describes a pilot of a weekly web based videoconference support group for five caregivers of persons with dementia. All participants reported positive views of the group and videoconference medium. Improvements in caregiver anxiety, depression, and physical health scores were observed. Depression scores remained the same with difficulties experienced by the caregiver increasing slightly. Self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts and responding to disruptive behavior improved but worsened slightly for obtaining respite. We concluded that web based support was a positive experience for caregivers, providing them with an acceptable, feasible, low-cost technological alternative to in person support that reduced barriers to attendance by being available in homes.

AB  - BackgroundDelirium frequently affects older patients, increasing morbidity and mortality; however, the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Herein, we tested the cognitive disintegration model, which proposes that a breakdown in frontoparietal connectivity, provoked by increased slow-wave activity (SWA), causes delirium.MethodsWe recruited 70 surgical patients to have preoperative and postoperative cognitive testing, EEG, blood biomarkers, and preoperative MRI. To provide evidence for causality, any putative mechanism had to differentiate on the diagnosis of delirium; change proportionally to delirium severity; and correlate with a known precipitant for delirium, inflammation. Analyses were adjusted for multiple corrections (MCs) where appropriate.ResultsIn the preoperative period, subjects who subsequently incurred postoperative delirium had higher alpha power, increased alpha band connectivity (MC P<0.05), but impaired structural connectivity (increased radial diffusivity; MC P<0.05) on diffusion tensor imaging. These connectivity effects were correlated (r2=0.491; P=0.0012). Postoperatively, local SWA over frontal cortex was insufficient to cause delirium. Rather, delirium was associated with increased SWA involving occipitoparietal and frontal cortex, with an accompanying breakdown in functional connectivity. Changes in connectivity correlated with SWA (r2=0.257; P<0.0001), delirium severity rating (r2=0.195; P<0.001), interleukin 10 (r2=0.152; P=0.008), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (r2=0.253; P<0.001).ConclusionsWhilst frontal SWA occurs in all postoperative patients, delirium results when SWA progresses to involve posterior brain regions, with an associated reduction in connectivity in most subjects. Modifying SWA and connectivity may offer a novel therapeutic approach for delirium.Clinical trial registrationNCT03124303, NCT02926417

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been shown to reduce CRC incidence and mortality and is widely recommended. However, despite the demonstrated benefits of screening and ongoing efforts to improve screening rates, a large percentage of the population remains unscreened. Noninvasive stool based tests offer great opportunity to enhance screening uptake. The evidence supporting the use of both fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and stool DNA (sDNA) has been growing rapidly and both tests are now commercially available for use. Other stool biomarkers (eg, RNA and protein based) are also actively under study both for use independently and as adjuncts to the currently available tests. This mini review provides current, state of the art knowledge about noninvasive stool based screening. It includes a more detailed examination of those tests currently in use (ie, FIT and sDNA) but also provides an overview of stool testing options under development (ie, protein and RNA).

AB  - Summary The emerging operational role of the “Chief Clinical Informatics Officer” (CCIO) remains heterogeneous with individuals deriving from a variety of clinical settings and backgrounds. The CCIO is defined in title, responsibility, and scope of practice by local organizations. The term encompasses the more commonly used Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO) and Chief Nursing Informatics Officer (CNIO) as well as the rarely used Chief Pharmacy Informatics Officer (CPIO) and Chief Dental Informatics Officer (CDIO). The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) identified a need to better delineate the knowledge, education, skillsets, and operational scope of the CCIO in an attempt to address the challenges surrounding the professional development and the hiring processes of CCIOs. An AMIA task force developed knowledge, education, and operational skillset recommendations for CCIOs focusing on the common core aspect and describing individual differences based on Clinical Informatics focus. The task force concluded that while the role of the CCIO currently is diverse, a growing body of Clinical Informatics and increasing certification efforts are resulting in increased homogeneity. The task force advised that 1.) To achieve a predictable and desirable skillset, the CCIO must complete clearly defined and specified Clinical Informatics education and training. 2.) Future education and training must reflect the changing body of knowledge and must be guided by changing day-to-day informatics challenges. A better defined and specified education and skillset for all CCIO positions will motivate the CCIO workforce and empower them to perform the job of a 21st century CCIO. Formally educated and trained CCIOs will provide a competitive advantage to their respective enterprise by fully utilizing the power of Informatics science.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) provide great promise for identifying cohorts and enhancing research recruitment. Such approaches are sorely needed, but there are few descriptions in the literature of prevailing practices to guide their use. A multidisciplinary workgroup was formed to examine current practices in the use of EHRs in recruitment and to propose future directions. The group surveyed consortium members regarding current practices. Over 98% of the Clinical and Translational Science Award Consortium responded to the survey. Brokered and self-service data warehouse access are in early or full operation at 94% and 92% of institutions, respectively, whereas, EHR alerts to providers and to research teams are at 45% and 48%, respectively, and use of patient portals for research is at 20%. However, these percentages increase significantly to 88% and above if planning and exploratory work were considered cumulatively. For most approaches, implementation reflected perceived demand. Regulatory and workflow processes were similarly varied, and many respondents described substantive restrictions arising from logistical constraints and limitations on collaboration and data sharing. Survey results reflect wide variation in implementation and approach, and point to strong need for comparative research and development of best practices to protect patients and facilitate interinstitutional collaboration and multisite research.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this review is to answer three questions: 1) How are chronic pain severity and pain duration affected in patients with chronic pain and sleep disturbances that occur simultaneously? 2) What are common comorbidities and pain-related symptoms seen in patients with chronic pain and sleep disturbances? and 3) What are potentially effective pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options for both conditions? Methods Ovid Medline and PubMed were searched. Search terms included sleep wake disorder, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, treatment outcome, psychotherapy, complementary therapies, and therapeutics. Studies that assessed outcomes between individuals with chronic pain and those with concurrent chronic pain and sleep disturbances were included. Randomized controlled clinical trials of treatments for both conditions were included. Results Sixteen studies indicated that patients with both chronic pain and sleep disturbances have greater pain severity, longer duration of pain, greater disability, and are less physically active than those without sleep disturbances. Patients with both conditions are more likely to have concurrent depression, catastrophizing, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Thirty-three randomized controlled trials assessed treatment for both chronic pain and sleep disturbances. Pregabalin was the most frequently studied medication, showing improvement in pain and sleep symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia showed long-term improvement in sleep for patients with chronic pain. Conclusions Individuals with chronic pain and sleep disturbances have greater symptom severity, longer duration of symptoms, more disability, and additional comorbidities. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments may be useful in the treatment of concurrent chronic pain and sleep disturbances, but further study is needed.

AB  - Challenges persist on how to effectively integrate the electronic health record (EHR) into patient visits and clinical workflow, while maintaining patient-centered care. Our goal was to identify variations in, barriers to, and facilitators of the use of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) EHR in ambulatory care workflow in order better to understand how to integrate the EHR into clinical work. We observed and interviewed 20 ambulatory care providers across three geographically distinct VA medical centers. Analysis revealed several variations in, associated barriers to, and facilitators of EHR use corresponding to different units of analysis: computer interface, team coordination/workflow, and organizational. We discuss our findings in the context of different units of analysis and connect variations in EHR use to various barriers and facilitators. Findings from this study may help inform the design of the next generation of EHRs for the VA and other healthcare systems.

AB  - Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cares for more patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) than any other US health care system. We tracked the implementation strategies that VA sites used to implement highly effective new treatments for HCV with the aim of uncovering how combinations of implementation strategies influenced the uptake of the HCV treatment innovation. We applied Configurational Comparative Methods (CCMs) to uncover causal dependencies and identify difference-making strategy configurations, and to distinguish higher from lower HCV treating sites. Methods: We surveyed providers to assess VA sites’ use of 73 implementation strategies to promote HCV treatment in the fiscal year 2015. CCMs were used to identify strategy configurations that uniquely distinguished higher HCV from lower HCV treating sites. Results: From the 73 possible implementation strategies, CCMs identified 5 distinct strategy configurations, or “solution paths.” These were comprised of 10 individual strategies that collectively explained 80% of the sites with higher HCV treatment starts with 100% consistency. Using any one of the following 5 solution paths was sufficient to produce higher treatment starts: (1) technical assistance; (2) engaging in a learning collaborative AND designating leaders; (3) site visits AND outreach to patients to promote uptake and adherence; (4) developing resource sharing agreements AND an implementation blueprint; OR (5) creating new clinical teams AND sharing quality improvement knowledge with other sites AND engaging patients. There was equifinality in that the presence of any one of the 5 solution paths was sufficient for higher treatment starts. Conclusions: Five strategy configurations distinguished higher HCV from lower HCV treating sites with 100% consistency. CCMs represent a methodological advancement that can help inform high-yield implementation strategy selection and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of future implementation efforts.

TI  - <scp>PHQ</scp>‐9: global uptake of a depression scale

AB  - Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder, a greater cause of disability than any other disease, and a major contributor to direct and indirect health care costs1. In the absence of a laboratory or imaging test, eliciting patient symptoms by clinical interview or a self-report scale is the principal way to detect depression and monitor its response to treatment. First published in 2001, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9) has had global dissemination, with over 11,000 scientific citations and translations into more than 100 languages. It has been used in hundreds of clinical and population-based studies, incorporated into numerous depression guidelines, and implemented in many clinical practice settings. Depression screening is far from universal; however, where it occurs, the PHQ-9 is a leading scale2. The international spread of the PHQ-9 is likely due to multiple factors3. Its nine items comprise the DSM criteria for depressive disorders, making it both a severity and potentially diagnostic measure. The total score is a simple summation of item scores, and cut-points are easy to memorize: 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent thresholds for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Unlike some depression scales, the PHQ-9 is free to use as a public domain measure, and the many translations make it accessible to populations around the world. The PHQ family includes several abbreviated versions and companion scales4. The PHQ-2 is an ultra-brief screener that comprises the first two items (depressed mood and anhedonia), which are core criteria for depressive disorders. The PHQ-8 omits the ninth item that asks about thoughts of “being better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way”. Although conventionally considered a screening question for suicidal ideation, most positive responses represent endorsement of the first part of this compound item (i.e., being better off dead) rather than active thoughts of self-harm5, 6. Because the ninth item is the least frequently endorsed one, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 scores are nearly identical, as are severity cut-points7. The PHQ-8 is sometimes used in studies where depression is a secondary outcome and not the focus of the investigation, in population-based studies where interviews are administered by non-mental health professionals, or in clinical settings where patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are captured outside of an office visit, causing delays in clarifying positive responses to the ninth item. Companion scales evaluate common fellow travelers of depression. The P4 is a 4-item measure that evaluates suicidal ideation in individuals who endorse the ninth item of the PHQ-96. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) measures anxiety symptoms that co-occur in a third to half of patients with depression. Although initially developed for generalized anxiety disorder, the GAD-7 is also an effective screener for panic, social anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders4. The PHQ-15 and its abbreviated version (the Somatic Symptom Scale-8, SSS-8) assess the presence and severity of physical symptoms that are the complaints with which depressed patients most frequently present, and may denote concurrent somatic symptom disorder and other somatizing conditions8. Finally, the PHQ-4 consists of the PHQ-2 and the GAD-2 (abbreviated version of the GAD-7) and serves as an ultra-brief screener for depression and anxiety as well as general psychological distress. The PHQ family of scales, including many translations, are available at www.phqscreeners.com. Practical issues still constrain use of depression and other PRO measures in some clinical settings. Routine administration by the clinician or ancillary staff and manual entry of scores into the health records require time that is typically unreimbursed. The PHQ-9 and other PROs generally do not require an interview but rather can be self-administered using a variety of modes (e.g., paper or web-based forms, iPads, apps) before an office visit or while at home. Completed PROs can then be electronically imported or scanned into the records. Whereas universal depression screening is advocated by some guidelines, the optimal frequency of screening is not established. One approach is to screen all new patients and then annually in established patients. Because screening every patient at every visit is excessive, reminders of when screening is due are required. Another key role of depression measures is to monitor outcomes in response to active treatment of depression or, in some cases, watchful waiting. Again, flagging which patients require follow-up PHQ-9 administration must be operationalized. One critique of scales like the PHQ-9 is that depression is not simply a number. Certainly, a depression score alone should not generate a reflexive depression diagnosis or antidepressant prescription, but requires clinical evaluation to determine if the threshold for clinical action has been reached. The length of time symptoms have been present, the degree of functional impairment, and patient treatment preferences, combined with the severity of symptoms as denoted by the depression score, collectively inform treatment decisions, be it psychotherapy, medications, or watchful waiting. When following depression longitudinally, it is useful to couple the PHQ-9 score with a question about global change: “Are your symptoms the same, better, or worse?”. Discordance between the depression score and global impression of change may have several explanations, including residual somatic symptoms such as insomnia or fatigue; co-occurring symptoms such as anxiety or pain; other medical or psychiatric comorbidity; stress or interpersonal factors; or a lag in functional improvement. Is a universal depression measure necessary? The PHQ-9 has generally been shown to be similar or superior in performance to competing depression scales, including in special populations such as older adults, adolescents, pregnant or postpartum women, diverse racial/ethnic groups, patients with various medical and psychiatric diseases, and across clinical settings. Nonetheless, a number of depression scales are available and have their proponents, and methods for cross-walking depression scores across measures are increasingly available9. Incorporating PROs into practice is less about the specific measure (presuming it is well validated) than the act of measuring; it is more about the verb than the noun. On the other hand, using a common measure may facilitate communication across clinical settings and avoid the Tower of Babel phenomenon wherein different “languages” (i.e., metrics) are used for the same condition. Uptake of the PHQ-9 in the past two decades has paralleled the increasing recognition of depression as an international public health priority, and the discovery that measurement is the first step towards detection and improved management. In the words of M. Chan, former director of the World Health Organization, “accountability means counting; what gets measured gets done”. Ditto for depression.

AB  - Little is known about the association between obesity and bowel preparation. We investigated whether body mass index (BMI) is an independent risk factor for inadequate bowel preparation in patients who receive split preparation regimens.We performed a retrospective study of data from 2163 consecutive patients (mean age, 60.6 ± 10.5 y; 93.8% male) who received outpatient colonoscopies in 2009 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana. All patients received a split preparation, categorized as adequate (excellent or good, based on the Aronchick scale) or inadequate. We performed a multivariable analysis to identify factors independently associated with inadequate preparation.Bowel preparation quality was inadequate for 44.2% of patients; these patients had significantly higher mean BMIs than patients with adequate preparation (31.2 ± 6.5 vs 29.8 ± 5.9, respectively; P < .0001) and Charlson comorbidity scores (1.5 ± 1.6 vs 1.1 ± 1.4; P < .0001). Independent risk factors for inadequate preparation were a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or greater (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.75; P < .0001), use of tobacco (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.54; P = .0084) or narcotics (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.57; P = .0179), hypertension (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.57; P = .0085), diabetes (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.69; P = .0021), and dementia (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.22-7.49; P = .0169).BMI is an independent factor associated with inadequate split bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Additional factors associated with quality of bowel preparation include diabetes, hypertension, dementia, and use of tobacco and narcotics. Patients with BMIs of 30 kg/m(2) or greater should be considered for more intensive preparation regimens.

AB  - Objective To determine at 1 year after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury the (1) rate of clinically significant anxiety; (2) rates of specific symptoms of anxiety; (3) risk factors for anxiety; and (4) associations of anxiety with other 1-year outcomes, including participation and quality of life. Design Prospective longitudinal observational study. Setting Inpatient rehabilitation centers, with data capture at injury and 1-year follow-up. Participants Persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems database (N=1838). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (9-item screen for depression), FIM, Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective, and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Results Clinically significant anxiety was reported by 21% of the participants. Of these, >80% reported interference with daily activities, with the most common symptoms being excessive worry and irritability. A common pattern was comorbid anxiety and depression, with smaller proportions reporting either disorder alone. Anxiety had large effect sizes with respect to life satisfaction and cognitive disability and medium to small effect sizes relative to societal participation and self-care. Middle age, black race, lower socioeconomic status, preinjury mental health treatment, and at least 1 traumatic brain injury prior to the index injury were all risk factors for later anxiety. Conclusions Anxiety should be screened, fully evaluated, and treated after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Worry and irritability might be treated with pharmacologic agents or relatively simple behavioral interventions, which should be further researched in this population.

AB  - Colorectal cancer screening dates to the discovery of precancerous adenomatous tissue. Screening modalities and guidelines directed at prevention and early detection have evolved and resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence and mortality of colorectal cancer via direct visualization or using specific markers. Despite continued efforts and an overall reduction in deaths attributed to colorectal cancer over the last 25 years, colorectal cancer remains one of the most common causes of malignancy-associated deaths. In attempt to further reduce the prevalence of colorectal cancer and associated deaths, continued improvement in screening quality and adherence remains key. Noninvasive screening modalities are actively being explored. Identification of specific genetic alterations in the adenoma-cancer sequence allow for the study and development of noninvasive screening modalities beyond guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing which target specific alterations or a panel of alterations. The stool DNA test is the first noninvasive screening tool that targets both human hemoglobin and specific genetic alterations. In this review we discuss stool DNA and other commercially available noninvasive colorectal cancer screening modalities in addition to other targets which previously have been or are currently under study.

AB  - Objectives The population of older patients with schizophrenia is increasing. This study describes health outcomes, utilization, and costs over 10 years in a sample of older patients with schizophrenia compared with older patients without schizophrenia. Methods An observational cohort study of 31,588 older adults (mean age: 70.44 years) receiving care from an urban public health system, including a community mental health center, during 1999–2008. Of these, 1,635 (5.2%) were diagnosed with schizophrenia and 757 (2.4%) had this diagnosis confirmed in the community mental health center. Patients' electronic medical records were merged with Medicare claims, Medicaid claims, the Minimum Dataset, and the Outcome and Assessment Information Set. Information on medication use was not available. Measurements Rates of comorbid conditions, healthcare utilization, costs, and mortality. Results Patients with schizophrenia had significantly higher rates of congestive heart failure (45.05% versus 38.84%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (52.71% versus 41.41%), and hypothyroidism (36.72% versus 26.73%) than the patients without schizophrenia (p <0.001). They had significantly lower rates of cancer (30.78% versus 43.18%) and significantly higher rates of dementia (64.46% versus 32.13%). The patients with schizophrenia had significantly higher mortality risk (hazard ratio: 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.07–1.47) than the patients without schizophrenia. They also had significantly higher rates of healthcare utilization. The mean costs for Medicare and Medicaid were significantly higher for the patients with schizophrenia than for the patients without schizophrenia. Conclusions The management of older adult patients with schizophrenia is creating a serious burden for our healthcare system, requiring the development of integrated models of healthcare.

AB  - Recommendations for diabetes prevention in patients with prediabetes include lifestyle modification and metformin. However, the significance of early weight loss and glucose measurements when monitoring response to these proven interventions is unknown. To quantify the relationship between early measures of weight and glucose and subsequent diabetes in patients undergoing diabetes prevention interventions. Analysis of results from a randomized controlled trial in 27 academic medical centers in the United States. 3,041 adults with hyperglycemia randomized to lifestyle (n = 1,018), metformin (n = 1,036), or placebo (n = 987) with complete follow-up in The Diabetes Prevention Program. Independent variables were weight loss at 6 and 12 months; fasting glucose (FG) at 6 months; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 months; and post-load glucose at 12 months. The main outcome was time to diabetes diagnosis. After 6 months, 604 participants developed diabetes in the lifestyle (n = 140), metformin (n = 206), and placebo (n = 258) arms over 2.7 years. In the lifestyle arm, 6-month weight loss predicted decreased diabetes risk in a graded fashion: adjusted HR (95 % CI) 0.65 (0.35–1.22), 0.62 (0.33–1.18), 0.46 (0.24–0.87), 0.34 (0.18–0.64), and 0.15 (0.07–0.30) for 0–<3 %, 3–<5 %, 5–<7 %, 7–<10 %, and ≥10 % weight loss, respectively (reference: weight gain). Attainment of optimal 6-month FG and HbA1c and 12-month post-load glucose predicted >60 % lower diabetes risk across arms. We found a significant interaction between 6-month weight loss and FG in the lifestyle arm (P = 0.038). Weight and glucose at 6 and 12 months strongly predict lower subsequent diabetes risk with a lifestyle intervention; lower FG predicts lower risk even with substantial weight loss. Early reduction in glycemia is a stronger predictor of future diabetes risk than weight loss for metformin. We offer the first evidence to guide clinicians in making interval management decisions for high-risk patients undertaking measures to prevent diabetes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if a baseline high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) value ≤99th percentile upper reference limit (0.014 μg/l [“low hsTnT”]) identifies patients at low risk for adverse outcomes. Approximately 85% of patients who present to emergency departments with acute heart failure are admitted. Identification of patients at low risk might decrease unnecessary admissions. A post-hoc analysis was conducted from the RELAX-AHF (Serelaxin, Recombinant Human Relaxin-2, for Treatment of Acute Heart Failure) trial, which randomized patients within 16 h of presentation who had systolic blood pressure >125 mm Hg, mild to moderate renal impairment, and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide ≥1,600 ng/l to serelaxin versus placebo. Linear regression models for continuous endpoints and Cox models for time-to-event endpoints were used. Of the 1,076 patients with available baseline hsTnT values, 107 (9.9%) had low hsTnT. No cardiovascular (CV) deaths through day 180 were observed in the low-hsTnT group compared with 79 CV deaths (7.3%) in patients with higher hsTnT. By univariate analyses, low hsTnT was associated with lower risk for all 5 primary outcomes: 1) days alive and out of the hospital by day 60; 2) CV death or rehospitalization for heart failure or renal failure by day 60; 3) length of stay; 4) worsening heart failure through day 5; and 5) CV death through day 180. After multivariate adjustment, only 180-day CV mortality remained significant (hazard ratio: 0.0; 95% confidence interval: 0.0 to 0.736; p = 0.0234; C-index = 0.838 [95% confidence interval: 0.798 to 0.878]). No CV deaths through day 180 were observed in patients with hsTnT levels ≤0.014 μg/l despite high N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide levels. Low baseline hsTnT may identify patients with acute heart failure at very low risk for CV mortality.

AB  - Abstract TFE3 Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma (TFE3-RCC) generally progresses more aggressively compared with other RCC subtypes, but it is challenging to diagnose TFE3-RCC by traditional visual inspection of pathological images. In this study, we collect hematoxylin and eosin- stained histopathology whole-slide images of 74 TFE3-RCC cases (the largest cohort to date) and 74 clear cell RCC cases (ccRCC, the most common RCC subtype) with matched gender and tumor grade. An automatic computational pipeline is implemented to extract image features. Comparative study identifies 52 image features with significant differences between TFE3-RCC and ccRCC. Machine learning models are built to distinguish TFE3-RCC from ccRCC. Tests of the classification models on an external validation set reveal high accuracy with areas under ROC curve ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can capture subtle morphological differences between TFE3-RCC and ccRCC and contribute to a potential guideline for TFE3-RCC diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Our goal is to summarize the collective experience of 15 organizations in dealing with uncoordinated efforts that result in unnecessary delays in understanding, predicting, preparing for, containing, and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Response efforts involve the collection and analysis of data corresponding to healthcare organizations, public health departments, socioeconomic indicators, as well as additional signals collected directly from individuals and communities. We focused on electronic health record (EHR) data, since EHRs can be leveraged and scaled to improve clinical care, research, and to inform public health decision-making. We outline the current challenges in the data ecosystem and the technology infrastructure that are relevant to COVID-19, as witnessed in our 15 institutions. The infrastructure includes registries and clinical data networks to support population-level analyses. We propose a specific set of strategic next steps to increase interoperability, overall organization, and efficiencies

AB  - Previous studies have measured individuals' willingness to share personal information stored in electronic health records (EHRs) with health care providers, but none has measured preferences among patients when they are allowed to determine the parameters of provider access.Patients were given the ability to control access by doctors, nurses, and other staff in a primary care clinic to personal information stored in an EHR. Patients could restrict access to all personal data or to specific types of sensitive information, and could restrict access for a specific time period. Patients also completed a survey regarding their understanding of and opinions regarding the process.Of 139 eligible patients who were approached, 105 (75.5 %) were enrolled, and preferences were collected from all 105 (100 %). Sixty patients (57 %) did not restrict access for any providers. Of the 45 patients (43 %) who chose to limit the access of at least one provider, 36 restricted access only to all personal information in the EHR, while nine restricted access of some providers to a subset of the their personal information. Thirty-four (32.3 %) patients blocked access to all personal information by all doctors, nurses, and/or other staff, 26 (24.8 %) blocked access by all doctors and/or nurses, and five (4.8 %) denied access to all doctors, nurses, and staff.A significant minority of patients chose to restrict access by their primary care providers to personal information contained in an EHR, and few chose to restrict access to specific types of information. More research is needed to identify patient goals and understanding of the implications when facing decisions of this sort, and to identify the impact of patient education regarding information contained in EHRs and their use in the clinical care setting.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the domestic care environment on the prevalence of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among orphaned and separated children in Uasin Gishu County, western Kenya. Methods A total of 1565 (55.5% male) orphaned and separated adolescents aged 10–18 years (mean 13.8 years, sd 2.2), were assessed for PTSD and PTEs including bullying, physical abuse and sexual abuse. In this sample, 746 lived in extended family households, 746 in Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs), and 73 on the street. Posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) scores and PTSD were assessed using the Child PTSD Checklist. Results Bullying was the commonest PTE in all domestic care environments, followed by physical and sexual abuse. All PTEs were commonest among the street youth followed by CCIs. However, sexual abuse was more prevalent in households than in CCIs. Prevalence of PTSD was highest among street youth (28.8%), then households (15.0%) and CCIs (11.5%). PTSS scores were also highest among street youth, followed by CCIs and households. Bullying was associated with higher PTSS scores and PTSD odds than either sexual or physical abuse. Conclusion This study demonstrated differences in distribution of trauma and PTSD among orphaned and separated children in different domestic care environments, with street youth suffering more than those in CCIs or households. Interventions are needed to address bullying and sexual abuse, especially in extended family households. Street youth, a heretofore neglected population, are urgently in need of dedicated mental health services and support.

AB  - The entire drug safety enterprise has a need to search, retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize scientific evidence more efficiently. This discovery and synthesis process would be greatly accelerated through access to a common framework that brings all relevant information sources together within a standardized structure. This presents an opportunity to establish an open-source community effort to develop a global knowledge base, one that brings together and standardizes all available information for all drugs and all health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from all electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. To make this vision a reality, we have established a workgroup within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, http://ohdsi.org) collaborative. The workgroup's mission is to develop an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products and an efficient procedure for maintaining and expanding it. The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs. This non-trivial task will result in a high-quality and generally applicable drug safety knowledge base. It will also yield a reference standard of drug-HOI pairs that will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods.

AB  - The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 includes provisions for hospital readmission penalties for skilled nursing facilities ( SNF s) starting in 2018. This presents an opportunity for care improvement but also raises several concerns regarding quality of care. The readmission measure for SNF s is similar to the current readmission measure for hospitals mandated under the Affordable Care Act, with the exception of adjustments made for sex. Because these measures for hospitals are similar, lessons can be learned from implementation of the existing hospital readmission penalties. In addition, there are three specific concerns that the authors relate to implementing the proposed measure in SNF s. There is poor communication and care coordination between care settings, including posthospitalization and post‐ SNF care in the current healthcare system. Adding readmission penalties to SNF regulations may create perverse incentives for prolonged SNF stays. The evidence base for the best means of caring for individuals after a brief stay in a SNF needs enrichment. These challenges need to be addressed as part of implementation of these new hospital readmission penalties for SNF s to improve care and prevent new unintended consequences.

AB  - To develop consensus recommendations on urine drug monitoring (UDM) in patients with chronic pain who are prescribed opioids.An interdisciplinary group of clinicians with expertise in pain, substance use disorders, and primary care conducted virtual meetings to review relevant literature and existing guidelines and share their clinical experience in UDM before reaching consensus recommendations.Definitive (e.g., chromatography-based) testing is recommended as most clinically appropriate for UDM because of its accuracy; however, institutional or payer policies may require initial use of presumptive testing (i.e., immunoassay). The rational choice of substances to analyze for UDM involves considerations that are specific to each patient and related to illicit drug availability. Appropriate opioid risk stratification is based on patient history (especially psychiatric conditions or history of opioid or substance use disorder), prescription drug monitoring program data, results from validated risk assessment tools, and previous UDM. Urine drug monitoring is suggested to be performed at baseline for most patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain and at least annually for those at low risk, two or more times per year for those at moderate risk, and three or more times per year for those at high risk. Additional UDM should be performed as needed on the basis of clinical judgment.Although evidence on the efficacy of UDM in preventing opioid use disorder, overdose, and diversion is limited, UDM is recommended by the panel as part of ongoing comprehensive risk monitoring in patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain.

AB  - Background Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. Methods We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (&gt;90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV &lt;50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p&lt;0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p&lt;0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p&lt;0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p&lt;0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001) was associated with infection. Conclusions Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue, the SPADE pentad, are the most prevalent and co-occurring symptoms in the general population and clinical practice. Co-occurrence of SPADE symptoms may produce additive impairment and negatively affect treatment response, potentially undermining patients’ health and functioning. The purpose of this paper is to determine: (1) prevalence and comorbidity (ie, clustering) of SPADE symptoms; (2) internal reliability and construct validity of a composite SPADE symptom score derived from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures; and (3) whether improvement in somatic symptom burden represented by a composite score predicted subsequent measures of functional status at 3 and 12 months follow-up. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness study, a randomized trial of a collaborative care intervention for Veterans with chronic pain. Results: Most patients had multiple SPADE symptoms; only 9.6% of patients were monosymptomatic. The composite PROMIS symptom score had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha=0.86) and construct validity and strongly correlated with multiple measures of functional status; improvement in the composite score significantly correlated with higher scores for 5 of 6 functional status outcomes. The standardized error of measurement (SEM) for the composite T-score was 2.84, suggesting a 3-point difference in an individual’s composite score may be clinically meaningful. Discussion: Brief PROMIS measures may be useful in evaluating SPADE symptoms and overall symptom burden. Because symptom burden may predict functional status outcomes, better identification and management of comorbid symptoms may be warranted.

AB  - Introduction High levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are central to HIV management. The objective of this study was to compare multiple measures of adherence and investigate factors associated with adherence among HIV‐infected children in western Kenya. Methods We evaluated ART adherence prospectively for six months among HIV‐infected children aged ≤14 years attending a large outpatient HIV clinic in Kenya. Adherence was reported using caregiver report, plasma drug concentrations and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS ® ). Kappa statistics were used to compare adherence estimates with MEMS ® . Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between child, caregiver and household characteristics with dichotomized adherence (MEMS ® adherence ≥90% vs. &lt;90%) and MEMS ® treatment interruptions of ≥48 hours. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Results Among 191 children, mean age at baseline was 8.2 years and 55% were female. Median adherence by MEMS ® was 96.3% and improved over the course of follow‐up ( p &lt;0.01), although 49.5% of children had at least one MEMS ® treatment interruption of ≥48 hours. Adherence estimates were highest by caregiver report, and there was poor agreement between MEMS ® and other adherence measures (Kappa statistics 0.04–0.37). In multivariable logistic regression, only caregiver‐reported missed doses in the past 30 days (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14–1.39), late doses in the past seven days (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.22) and caregiver‐reported problems with getting the child to take ART (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.20) were significantly associated with dichotomized MEMS ® adherence. The caregivers reporting that ART made the child sick (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.25) and reporting difficulties in the community that made giving ART more difficult (e.g. stigma) (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.27) were significantly associated with MEMS ® treatment interruptions in multivariable logistic regression. Conclusions Non‐adherence in the form of missed and late doses, treatment interruptions of more than 48 hours and sub‐therapeutic drug levels were common in this cohort. Adherence varied significantly by adherence measure, suggesting that additional validation of adherence measures is needed. Few factors were consistently associated with non‐adherence or treatment interruptions.

AB  - Facilitation is a key component for successful implementation in several implementation frameworks; however, there is a paucity of research specifying this component. As part of a stroke quality improvement intervention in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), facilitation plus data feedback was compared to data feedback alone in 11 VA medical facilities. The objective of this study was to elucidate upon the facilitation components of the stroke quality improvement. We conducted a secondary evaluation of external facilitation using semi-structured interviews. Five facilitators and two program directors were interviewed. Qualitative analysis was performed on transcribed interviews to gain an understanding of the role and activities of external facilitators during the on-site and telephone facilitation. Quantitative frequencies were calculated from the self-reported time spent in facilitation tasks by facilitators. The external facilitators saw their role as empowering the clinical teams to take ownership of the process changes at the clinical sites to improve their performance quality. To fulfill this role, they reported engaging in a number of core tasks during telephone and on-site visits including: assessing the context in which the teams were currently operating, guiding the clinical teams through their planned changes and use of process improvement tools, identifying resources and making referrals, holding teams accountable for plan implementation with on-site visits, and providing support and encouragement to the teams. Time spent in facilitation activities changed across time from guiding change (early) to supporting efforts made by the clinical teams (later). Facilitation activity transitioned to more monitoring, problem solving, and intentional work to hand over the clinical improvement process to the site teams with the coach’s role being increasingly that of a more distant consultant. Overall, this study demonstrated that external facilitation is not an event but rather a process where relationships and responsibilities evolve over time. This study shows that external facilitation involves core elements related to communication, relationship building, methods training, monitoring performance over time, and facilitating team-based problem solving. Importantly, this work demonstrates the fluid nature of external facilitation over time, as teams learn, grow, change, and experience changing contexts.

AB  - Increasingly, health care providers are adopting population health management approaches that address the social determinants of health (SDH). However, effectively identifying patients needing services that address a SDH in primary care settings is challenging. The purpose of the current study is to explore how various data sources can identify adult primary care patients that are in need of services that address SDH. A cross-sectional study described patients in need of SDH services offered by a safety-net hospital’s federally qualified health center clinics. SDH services of social work, behavioral health, nutrition counseling, respiratory therapy, financial planning, medical-legal partnership assistance, patient navigation, and pharmacist consultation were offered on a co-located basis and were identified using structured billing and scheduling data, and unstructured electronic health record data. We report the prevalence of the eight different SDH service needs and the patient characteristics associated with service need. Moreover, characteristics of patients with SDH services need documented in structured data sources were compared with those documented by unstructured data sources. More than half (53%) of patients needed SDH services. Those in need of such services tended to be female, older, more medically complex, and higher utilizers of services. Structured and unstructured data sources exhibited poor agreement on patient SDH services need. Patients with SDH services need documented by unstructured data tended to be more complex. The need for SDH services among a safety-net population is high. Identifying patients in need of such services requires multiple data sources with structured and unstructured data.

AB  - Adults with mental health conditions are more likely than those without to receive long-term opioid therapy. Less is known about opioid therapy among adolescents, especially those with mental health conditions.To examine associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and initiation of any opioid and long-term opioid therapy among adolescents.A cohort of 1 224 520 incident opioid recipients without cancer diagnoses aged 14 to 18 years at first receipt was extracted from nationwide commercial health care claims data from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from August 19, 2016, to November 16, 2017. Associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and any opioid receipt were examined by comparing recipients with nonrecipients matched on sex, calendar year and years of age of first enrollment, and months of enrollment (prior to the index month for recipients, ever for nonrecipients). Associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and subsequent long-term opioid therapy were examined among recipients with at least 6 months' follow-up using Cox proportional hazards regressions adjusted for demographics.Mental health condition diagnoses and treatments recorded in inpatient, outpatient, and filled-prescription claims prior to opioid receipt.Opioid receipt, defined as any opioid analgesic prescription claim, and long-term opioid therapy, defined as more than 90 days' supply within a 6-month window having no gaps in supply of more than 32 days.Of the 1 224 520 new opioid recipients included, the median age at first receipt was 17 years (interquartile range, 16-18 years), and 51.1% were female. Median follow-up after first receipt was 625 days (interquartile range, 255-1268 days). Adolescents with anxiety, mood, neurodevelopmental, sleep, and nonopioid substance use disorders and most mental health treatments were significantly more likely to receive any opioid (odds ratios from 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10-1.16] for nonopioid substance use disorders to 1.69 [95% CI, 1.58-1.81] for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics). Among the 1 000 453 opioid recipients (81.7%) who had at least 6 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of long-term opioid therapy was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.8-3.1) per 1000 recipients within 3 years after first opioid receipt. All preexisting mental health conditions and treatments were strongly associated with higher rates of long-term opioid therapy (adjusted hazard ratios from 1.73 [95% CI 1.54-1.95] for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to 8.90 [95% CI, 5.85-13.54] for opioid use disorder).Commercially insured adolescents with many types of preexisting mental health conditions and treatments were modestly more likely to receive any opioid and were substantially more likely to subsequently transition to long-term opioid therapy relative to those without, although overall rates of long-term opioid therapy were low.

AB  - Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) scales are increasingly being used to measure symptoms in research and practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimally important difference (MID) and severity thresholds (cut-points) for the four fixed-length PROMIS depression scales. The study sample was adult participants in three randomized clinical trials (N=651). MID was estimated using multiple distribution- and anchor-based approaches including assessing correspondence between Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PROMIS depression scores. The best MID estimate was a PROMIS depression T-score of 3.5 points with most methods producing an MID in the 3 to 4 point range across all three samples. MID estimates were similar for all four PROMIS scales. A PHQ-9 1-point change equated to a PROMIS 1.25-point T-score change. PROMIS T-scores of 55, 60, 65, and 70 appeared to be reasonable thresholds for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The study sample was predominantly male veterans with either chronic pain (2 trials) or previous stroke (1 trial). The severity of depression was mild to moderate. A T-score of 3 to 4 points is a reasonable MID for PROMIS depression scales and can be used to assess treatment effects in both practice and research as well to calculate sample sizes for clinical trials. Severity cut-points can help interpret the meaning of scores and action thresholds for treatment decisions.

AB  - Colonoscopy is widely used in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention, but its effect on CRC mortality is unknown.To determine whether colonoscopy is associated with decreased CRC mortality in veterans and whether its effect differs by anatomical location of CRC.Case-control study.VA-Medicare administrative data.Case patients were veterans aged 52 years or older who were diagnosed with CRC between 2002 and 2008 and died of the disease by the end of 2010. Case patients were matched to 4 control patients without prior CRC on the basis of age, sex, and facility. Conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for exposure to colonoscopy, with adjustment for race, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, selected chronic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and family history of CRC.Exposure to colonoscopy was determined from 1997 to 6 months before CRC diagnosis in case patients and to a corresponding date in control patients. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients who had undergone screening colonoscopy.A total of 4964 case patients and 19 856 control patients were identified. Case patients were significantly less likely to have undergone any colonoscopy (OR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.43]). Colonoscopy was associated with reduced mortality for left-sided cancer (OR, 0.28 [CI, 0.24 to 0.32]) and right-sided cancer (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.47 to 0.63]). The results were similar for patients who had undergone screening colonoscopy (overall OR, 0.30 [CI, 0.24 to 0.38]). Sensitivity analyses that varied the interval between CRC diagnosis and colonoscopy exposure did not affect the primary findings.Unmeasured confounding.In this study using national VA-Medicare data, colonoscopy was associated with significant reductions in CRC mortality among veterans and was associated with greater benefit for left-sided cancer than right-sided cancer.U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

AB  - Composite measures that assess the overall burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms have been infrequently evaluated in the same study. The objective of this study was to compare the validity and responsiveness of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) and other composite anxiety-depression measures. The sample comprised 256 primary care patients enrolled in a telecare trial of chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid depression and/or anxiety. Measures included the PHQ-ADS; the 8-item and 4-item depression and anxiety scales from the PROMIS profiles; the PHQ-anxiety-depression scale (PHQ-4); the SF-36 Mental Health scale; and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale. Correlations among these measures and health-related quality of life measures were examined. Responsiveness was evaluated by standardized response means, area under the curve (AUC) analyses, and treatment effect sizes in the trial. Convergent and construct validity was supported by strong correlations of the composite depression-anxiety measures with one another and moderate correlations with health-related quality of life measures, respectively. All composite measures differentiated patients who were better at 3 months, whereas the PHQ-ADS and PHQ-4 also distinguished the subgroup that had worsened. AUCs for composite measures were generally similar, whereas treatment effect sizes were largest for the PHQ-ADS. The study sample was predominantly male veterans enrolled from primary care who had chronic musculoskeletal pain and moderate levels of depression and anxiety. Composite depression and anxiety scales are valid and responsive measures that may be useful as outcomes in research and clinical practice.

AB  - Visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP) variability has received considerable attention recently. The objective of our study is to define a variability measure that is independent of change over time and determine the association between longitudinal summary measures of BP measurements and mortality risk. Data for the study came from a prospective cohort of 2906 adults, aged ≥60 years, in an urban primary care system with ≤15 years of follow-up. Dates of death for deceased participants were retrieved from the National Death Index. Systolic and diastolic BP measurements from outpatient clinic visits were extracted from the Regenstrief Medical Record System. For each patient, the intercept, regression slope, and root mean square error for visit-to-visit variability were derived using linear regression models and used as independent variables in Cox proportional hazards models for both all-cause mortality and mortality attributable to coronary heart disease or stroke. Rate of change was associated with mortality risk in a U-shaped relationship and that participants with little or no change in BP had the lowest mortality risk. BP variability was not an independent predictor of mortality risk. By separating change over time from visit-to-visit variability in studies with relatively long follow-up, we demonstrated in this elderly primary care patient population that BP changes over time, not variability, were associated with greater mortality risk. Future research is needed to confirm our findings in other populations.

AB  - Background & AimsIn older individuals, there are unclear effects of lower endoscopy on incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and of colonoscopy on site of CRC. We investigated whether sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is associated with a decreased incidence of CRC in older individuals, and whether the effect of colonoscopy differs by anatomic location.MethodsWe performed a case-control study using linked US Veterans Affairs and Medicare data. Cases were veterans aged 75 years or older diagnosed with CRC in fiscal year 2007. Cases were matched for age and sex to 3 individuals without a CRC diagnosis (controls). We determined the number of cases and controls who received colonoscopies or sigmoidoscopies from fiscal year 1997 to a date 6 months before the diagnosis of CRC (for cases) or to a corresponding index date (for controls). The probability of exposure was modeled using generalized linear mixed equations, adjusted for potential confounders. For the analysis of CRC risk in different anatomic locations, the proximal colon was defined as proximal to the splenic flexure.ResultsWe identified 623 cases and 1869 controls (mean age, 81 y; 98.7% male, 86.2% Caucasian). Among cases, 243 (39.0%) underwent any lower endoscopy (177 colonoscopies). Among controls, 978 (52.3%) underwent any lower endoscopy (758 colonoscopies). Cases were significantly less likely than controls to have undergone lower endoscopy within the preceding 10 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48–0.69). This effect was significant for colonoscopy (aOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47–0.70), but not sigmoidoscopy. Similar results were observed when a 5-year exposure window was applied. Colonoscopy was associated with a reduced risk of distal CRC (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32–0.62) and proximal CRC (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46–0.92).ConclusionsIn a study of the US Veterans Affairs and Medicare databases, lower endoscopy in the preceding 10 years was associated with a significant reduction in CRC incidence among older veterans.

AB  - There is clear and consistent evidence that regular physical activity is an important component of healthy lifestyles and fundamental to promoting health and preventing disease. Despite the known benefits of physical activity participation, many people in the United States remain inactive. More specifically, physical activity behavior is socially patterned with lower participation rates among women; racial/ethnic minorities; sexual minority youth; individuals with less education; persons with physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities; individuals >65 yr of age; and those living in the southeast region of the United States. Many health-related outcomes follow a pattern that is similar to physical activity participation. In response to the problem of inequities in physical activity and overall health in the United States, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has developed a national roadmap that supports achieving health equity through a physically active lifestyle. The actionable, integrated pathways that provide the foundation of ACSM's roadmap include the following: 1) communication-raising awareness of the issue and magnitude of health inequities and conveying the power of physical activity in promoting health equity; 2) education-developing educational resources to improve cultural competency for health care providers and fitness professionals as well as developing new community-based programs for lay health workers; 3) collaboration-building partnerships and programs that integrate existing infrastructures and leverage institutional knowledge, reach, and voices of public, private, and community organizations; and 4) evaluation-ensuring that ACSM attains measurable progress in reducing physical activity disparities to promote health equity. This article provides a conceptual overview of these four pathways of ACSM's roadmap, an understanding of the challenges and advantages of implementing these components, and the organizational and economic benefits of achieving health equity.

AB  - Patient ergonomics is the application of human factors or related disciplines to study and improve patients' and other non-professionals’ performance of effortful work activities in pursuit of health goals. We performed a mapping review of 212 full-text patient ergonomics publications in two conference proceedings, 2007–2017. The review revealed a robust and growing body of literature on patient ergonomics, particularly in the areas of aging and chronic disease, tools and technologies, and evaluations of patient-centered interventions on outcomes such as usability, user acceptance, and performance. Findings highlighted gaps deserving future research, including research with understudied populations such as children, informal caregivers, networks and collectives (groups), and marginalized populations; on topics such as health promotion and transitions of care; and using longitudinal and experimental study designs. The growth of patient-centeredness in general and of patient ergonomics in particular compel other more focused reviews, new primary research, and developing a roadmap for future patient ergonomics research.

AB  - COVID-19 mortality disproportionally affects nursing homes, creating enormous pressures to deliver high-quality end-of-life care. Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans. Therefore, we aimed to identify, review, and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations. We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world. Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against prespecified eligibility criteria. We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques. We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care, from the World Health Organization (n = 3), and eight individual countries: U.S. (n = 7), The Netherlands (n = 2), Ireland (n = 1), U.K. (n = 3), Switzerland (n = 3), New Zealand (n = 1), and Belgium (n = 1). International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care–related topics. Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision making toward the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers). There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes. Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made. Key aspects of palliative care, that is, symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.

AB  - PURPOSE Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and their spatial characterizations on whole-slide images (WSIs) of histopathology sections have become crucial in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction for different cancers. However, fully automatic assessment of TILs on WSIs currently remains a great challenge because of the heterogeneity and large size of WSIs. We present an automatic pipeline based on a cascade-training U-net to generate high-resolution TIL maps on WSIs. METHODS We present global cell-level TIL maps and 43 quantitative TIL spatial image features for 1,000 WSIs of The Cancer Genome Atlas patients with breast cancer. For more specific analysis, all the patients were divided into three subtypes, namely, estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative groups. The associations between TIL scores and gene expression and somatic mutation were examined separately in three breast cancer subtypes. Both univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed on 43 TIL image features to examine the prognostic value of TIL spatial patterns in different breast cancer subtypes. RESULTS The TIL score was in strong association with immune response pathway and genes (eg, programmed death-1 and CLTA4). Different breast cancer subtypes showed TIL score in association with mutations from different genes suggesting that different genetic alterations may lead to similar phenotypes. Spatial TIL features that represent density and distribution of TIL clusters were important indicators of the patient outcomes. CONCLUSION Our pipeline can facilitate computational pathology-based discovery in cancer immunology and research on immunotherapy. Our analysis results are available for the research community to generate new hypotheses and insights on breast cancer immunology and development.

AB  - Background & AimsOver several decades, changes in health care have negatively impacted meaningful communication between the patient and provider and adversely affected their relationship. Under increasing time pressure, physicians rely more on technology than face-to-face time gathering data to make clinical decisions. As a result, they find it more challenging to understand the illness context and fully address patient needs. Patients experience dissatisfaction and a diminution of their role in the care process. For patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction, stigma leads to greater care dissatisfaction, as there is no apparent structural basis to legitimize the symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that practical communication skills can improve the patient–provider relationship (PPR) and clinical outcomes, but these data are limited.MethodsThe Rome Foundation convened a multidisciplinary working team to review the scientific evidence with the following aims: a) to study the effect of communication skills on patient satisfaction and outcomes by performing an evidence-based review; b) to characterize the influence of sociocultural factors, health care system constraints, patient perspective, and telehealth on the PPR; c) to review the measurement and impact of communication skills training on these outcomes; and d) to make recommendations to improve communication skills training and the PPR.ResultsEvidence supports the fact that interventions targeting patient–provider interactions improve population health, patient and provider experience, and costs. Communication skills training leads to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes. The following are relevant factors to consider in establishing an effective PPR: addressing health care system constraints; incorporating sociocultural factors and the role of gender, age, and chronic illness; and considering the changing role of telehealth on the PPR.ConclusionsWe concluded that effective communication skills can improve the PPR and health outcomes. This is an achievable goal through training and system change. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - An rs3890011 variant of CYP4A11, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the loss-of-function variant rs1126742, is associated with hypertension in humans. In mice, Cyp4a deficiency results in salt-sensitive hypertension through activation of ENaC. We tested the hypothesis that the rs3890011 variant is associated with blood pressure response to drugs acting via the ENaC pathway. African Americans with volume-dependent, resistant hypertension were randomized to treatment with placebo, spironolactone, amiloride, or combination. Blood pressure responses were analyzed by CYP4A11 genotypes. Rs3890011 (GG:GC:CC = 20:35:28) and rs1126742 (TT:TC:CC = 45:31:7) were in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1, r = 0.561). Expected small number of rs1126742 CC homozygotes precluded analysis of the effect of this genotype on treatment responses. Spironolactone reduced blood pressure in rs3890011 GG and GC individuals, but not in CC homozygotes (P = .002), whereas amiloride reduced blood pressure similarly in all rs3890011 genotypes. The antihypertensive effects of spironolactone and amiloride were comparable in GG and GC participants, but only amiloride reduced pressure in CC homozygotes (-6.3 ± 7.3/-3.2 ± 4.0 vs. +6.8 ± 7.9/+4.8 ± 8.6 mm Hg, P < .01/<.05). The aldosterone response to spironolactone was also blunted in the CC genotype. In individuals homozygous for the CYP4A11 rs3890011 C allele, blood pressure is resistant to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, but sensitive to ENaC inhibition, consistent with ENaC activation. Studies in a larger population are needed to replicate these findings.

AB  - Developmental delays and disabilities are common in children. Research has indicated that intervention during the early years of a child's life has a positive effect on cognitive development, social skills and behavior, and subsequent school performance.To determine whether a computerized clinical decision support system is an effective approach to improve standardized developmental surveillance and screening (DSS) within primary care practices.In this cluster randomized clinical trial performed in 4 pediatric clinics from June 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012, children younger than 66 months seen for primary care were studied.We compared surveillance and screening practices after adding a DSS module to an existing computer decision support system.The rates at which children were screened for developmental delay.Medical records were reviewed for 360 children (180 each in the intervention and control groups) to compare rates of developmental screening at the 9-, 18-, or 30-month well-child care visits. The DSS module led to a significant increase in the percentage of patients screened with a standardized screening tool (85.0% vs 24.4%, P < .001). An additional 120 records (60 each in the intervention and control groups) were reviewed to examine surveillance rates at visits outside the screening windows. The DSS module led to a significant increase in the percentage of patients whose parents were assessed for concerns about their child's development (71.7% vs 41.7%, P = .04).Using a computerized clinical decision support system to automate the screening of children for developmental delay significantly increased the numbers of children screened at 9, 18, and 30 months of age. It also significantly improved surveillance at other visits. Moreover, it increased the number of children who ultimately were diagnosed as having developmental delay and who were referred for timely services at an earlier age.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01351077.

AB  - While great progress has been made in digitizing the US health care system, today's health information technology (IT) infrastructure remains largely a collection of systems that are not designed to support a transition to value-based care. In addition, the pursuit of value-based care, in which we deliver better care with better outcomes at lower cost, places new demands on the health care system that our IT infrastructure needs to be able to support. Provider organizations pursuing new models of health care delivery and payment are finding that their electronic systems lack the capabilities needed to succeed. The result is a chasm between the current health IT ecosystem and the health IT ecosystem that is desperately needed.In this paper, we identify a set of focal goals and associated near-term achievable actions that are critical to pursue in order to enable the health IT ecosystem to meet the acute needs of modern health care delivery. These ideas emerged from discussions that occurred during the 2015 American Medical Informatics Association Policy Invitational Meeting. To illustrate the chasm and motivate our recommendations, we created a vignette from the multistakeholder perspectives of a patient, his provider, and researchers/innovators. It describes an idealized scenario in which each stakeholder's needs are supported by an integrated health IT environment. We identify the gaps preventing such a reality today and present associated policy recommendations that serve as a blueprint for critical actions that would enable us to cross the current health IT chasm by leveraging systems and information to routinely deliver high-value care.

AB  - BACKGROUND Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIP) aim to reduce violent-injury recidivism by providing intensive case management services to high-risk patients who were violently injured. Although HVIP have been found effective at reducing recidivism, few studies have sought to identity how long their effects last. Additionally, prior studies have been limited by the fact that HVIP typically rely on self-report or data within their own healthcare system to identify new injuries. Our aim was to quantify the long-term recidivism rate of participants in an HVIP program using more objective and comprehensive data from a regional health information exchange. METHODS The study included 328 patients enrolled in Prescription for Hope (RxH), an HVIP, between January 2009 and August 2016. We obtained RxH participants’ emergency department (ED) encounter data from a regional health information exchange database from the date of hospital discharge to February 2017. Our primary outcome was violent-injury recidivism rate of the RxH program. We also examined reasons for ED visits that were unrelated to violent injury. RESULTS We calculated a 4.4% recidivism rate based on 8 years of statewide data, containing 1,575 unique encounters. More than 96% of participants were matched in the state database. Of the 15 patients who recidivated, only five were admitted for their injury. More than half of new violence-related injuries were treated outside of the HVIP-affiliated trauma center. The most common reasons for ED visits were pain (718 encounters), followed by suspected complications or needing additional postoperative care (181 encounters). Substance abuse, unintentional injuries, and suicidal ideation were also frequent reasons for ED visits. CONCLUSION The low, long-term recidivism rate for RxH indicates that HVIPs have enduring positive effects on the majority of participants. Our results suggest that HVIP may further benefit patients by partnering with organizations that work to prevent suicide, substance use disorders, and other unintentional injuries.

AB  - ContextPersons with late-stage dementia have limited access to palliative care.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to test dementia-specific specialty palliative care triggered by hospitalization.MethodsThis pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 62 dyads of persons with late-stage dementia and family decision-makers on admission to hospital. Intervention dyads received dementia-specific specialty palliative care consultation plus postacute transitional care. Control dyads received usual care and educational information. The primary outcome was 60-day hospital or emergency department visits. Secondary patient- and family-centered outcomes were patient comfort, family distress, palliative care domains addressed in the treatment plan, and access to hospice or community-based palliative care. Secondary decision-making outcomes were discussion of prognosis, goals of care, completion of Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), and treatment decisions.ResultsOf 137 eligible dyads, 62 (45%) were enrolled. The intervention proved feasible, with protocol completion ranging from 77% (family two-week call) to 93% (initial consultation). Hospital and emergency department visits did not differ (intervention vs. control, 0.68 vs. 0.53 transfers per 60 days, P = 0.415). Intervention patients had more palliative care domains addressed and were more likely to receive hospice (25% vs. 3%, P < 0.019). Intervention families were more likely to discuss prognosis (90% vs. 3%, P < 0.001) and goals of care (90% vs. 25%, P < 0.001) and to have a MOST at 60-day follow-up (79% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). More intervention families made decisions to avoid rehospitalization (13% vs. 0%, P = 0.033).ConclusionSpecialty palliative care consultation for hospitalized patients with late-stage dementia is feasible and promising to improve decision-making and some treatment outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: To determine delirium occurrence rate, duration, and severity in patients admitted to the ICU with coronavirus disease 2019. Design: Retrospective data extraction study from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020. Delirium outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days in ICU. Setting: Two large, academic centers serving the state of Indiana. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020, were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any delirium assessments, or without discharge disposition were excluded. Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were delirium rates and duration, and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Two-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the analysis with a mean age of 58.4 years ( sd , 15.6 yr), 40.3% were female, 44.4% African American, 20.7% Hispanic, and a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 18 (interquartile range, 13–25). Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients, delirium prior to coma in 27.9%, and delirium after coma in 23.1%. The first Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU assessment was positive for delirium in 61.9%. Hypoactive delirium was the most common subtype (87.4%). By day 14, the median number of delirium/coma-free were 5 days (interquartile range, 4–11 d), and median Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 score was 6.5 (interquartile range, 5–7) indicating severe delirium. Benzodiazepines were ordered for 78.4% of patients in the cohort. Mechanical ventilation was associated with greater odds of developing delirium (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1–22.2; p = 0.033) even after adjusting for sedative medications. There were no between-group differences in mortality. Conclusions: Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients admitted to the ICU. Delirium persisted for a median of 5 days and was severe. Mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with odds of delirium even after adjustment for sedatives. Clinical attention to manage delirium duration and severity, and deeper understanding of the virus’ neurologic effects is needed for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - Background & Aims With an increased emphasis on improving quality and decreasing costs, new tools are needed to improve adherence to evidence-based practices and guidelines in endoscopy. We investigated the ability of an automated system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and clinical decision support (CDS) to facilitate determination of colonoscopy surveillance intervals. Methods We performed a retrospective study at a single Veterans Administration medical center of patients age 40 years and older who had an index outpatient colonoscopy from 2002 through 2009 for any indication except surveillance of a previous colorectal neoplasia. We analyzed data from 10,798 reports, with 6379 linked to pathology results and 300 randomly selected reports. NLP-based CDS surveillance intervals were compared with those determined by paired, blinded, manual review. The primary outcome was adjusted agreement between manual review and the fully automated system. Results κ statistical analysis produced a value of 0.74 (P < .001) for agreement between the full text annotation and the NLP-based CDS system. Fifty-five reports (18.3%; 95% confidence interval, 14.1%–23.2%) differed between manual review and CDS recommendations. Of these, NLP error accounted for 30 (54.5%), incomplete resection of adenomatous tissue accounted for 14 (25.5%), and masses observed without biopsy findings of cancer accounted for 4 (7.2%). NLP-based CDS surveillance intervals had higher levels of agreement with the standard (81.7%) than the level agreement between experts (72% agreement between paired reviewers). Conclusions A fully automated system that uses NLP and a guideline-based CSD system can accurately facilitate guideline-recommended adherence surveillance for colonoscopy.

We evaluated the impact of a "Wake-up and Breathe Protocol" at our local ICU on sedation and delirium.A pre/post implementation study design.A 22-bed mixed surgical and medical ICU.Seven hundred two consecutive mechanically ventilated ICU patients from June 2010 to January 2013.Implementation of daily paired spontaneous awakening trials (daily sedation vacation plus spontaneous breathing trials) as a quality improvement project.After implementation of our program, there was an increase in the mean Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores on weekdays of 0.88 (p < 0.0001) and an increase in the mean Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores on weekends of 1.21 (p < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, race, gender, severity of illness, primary diagnosis, and ICU, the incidence and prevalence of delirium did not change post implementation of the protocol (incidence: 23% pre vs 19.6% post; p = 0.40; prevalence: 66.7% pre vs 55.3% post; p = 0.06). The combined prevalence of delirium/coma decreased from 90.8% pre protocol implementation to 85% postimplementation (odds ratio, 0.505; 95% CI, 0.299-0.853; p = 0.01).Implementing a "Wake Up and Breathe Program" resulted in reduced sedation among critically ill mechanically ventilated patients but did not change the incidence or prevalence of delirium.

AB  - The current US system of reimbursement for dementia care does not support the complex biospychosocial needs of families living with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. We propose an alternative payment system for dementia care that would provide insurance coverage for evidence-based, collaborative dementia care models. This payment model involves a per member per month payment for care management services that would target community-dwelling beneficiaries living with dementia and evidence-based education and support programs for unpaid caregivers. This payment model has the potential to align the incentives of payers and providers and create market demand for the implementation of collaborative dementia care models across the nation.

AB  - ContextDeficits in quality end-of-life care for nursing home (NH) residents are well known. Palliative care is promoted as an approach to improve quality. The Palliative Care Survey (PCS) is designed to measure NH staff palliative care knowledge and practice.ObjectivesTo comparing palliative care knowledge and practices across NH staff roles using the PCS, and to examine relationships between facility characteristics and PCS scores.MethodsThe PCS was administered to frontline NH staff—certified nursing assistants (CNAs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), registered nurses (RNs), and social workers (SWs)—in 51 facilities in 2012. Descriptive statistics were calculated by job role. Linear mixed effects models were used to identify facility and individual factors associated with palliative care practice and knowledge.ResultsThe analytic sample included 1200 surveys. CNAs had significantly lower practice and knowledge scores compared to LPNs, RNs, and SWs (P < 0.05). LPNs had significantly lower psychological, end-of-life, and total knowledge scores than RNs (P < 0.05 for all). Although knowledge about physical symptoms was uniformly high, end-of-life knowledge was notably low for all staff. A one-point higher facility star rating was significantly associated with a 0.06 increase in family communication score (P = 0.003; 95% CI: 0.02–0.09; SE = 0.02). Higher penetration of hospice in the NH was associated with higher end-of-life knowledge (P = 0.003; parameter estimate = 0.006; 95% CI: 0.002–0.010; SE = 0.002). Sixty-two percent of respondents stated that, with additional training, they would be interested in being leaders in palliative care.ConclusionGiven observed differences in palliative care practice and knowledge scores by staff training, it appears the PCS is a useful tool to assess NH staff. Low end-of-life knowledge scores represent an important target for quality improvement.

AB  - Abstract Background Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 55 million orphaned children. The growing orphan crisis has overwhelmed many communities and has weakened the ability of extended families to meet traditional care-taking expectations. Other models of care and support have emerged in sub-Saharan Africa to address the growing orphan crisis, yet there is a lack of information on these models available in the literature. We applied a human rights framework using the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to understand what extent children’s basic human rights were being upheld in institutional vs. community- or family-based care settings in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. Methods The Orphaned and Separated Children’s Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being Project is a 5-year cohort of orphaned children and adolescents aged ≤18 year. This descriptive analysis was restricted to baseline data. Chi-Square test was used to test for associations between categorical /dichotomous variables. Fisher’s exact test was also used if some cells had expected value of less than 5. Results Included in this analysis are data from 300 households, 19 Charitable Children’s Institutions (CCIs) and 7 community-based organizations. In total, 2871 children were enrolled and had baseline assessments done: 1390 in CCI’s and 1481 living in households in the community. We identified and described four broad models of care for orphaned and separated children, including: institutional care (sub-classified as ‘Pure CCI’ for those only providing residential care, ‘CCI-Plus’ for those providing both residential care and community-based supports to orphaned children , and ‘CCI-Shelter’ which are rescue, detention, or other short-term residential support), family-based care, community-based care and self-care. Children in institutional care (95%) were significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) more likely to have their basic material needs met in comparison to those in family-based care (17%) and institutions were better able to provide an adequate standard of living. Conclusions Each model of care we identified has strengths and weaknesses. The orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa requires a diversity of care environments in order to meet the needs of children and uphold their rights. Family-based care plays an essential role; however, households require increased support to adequately care for children.

AB  - <h3>Objectives</h3> To determine the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) and assess their severity and preventability in four Saudi hospitals. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> The study included patients admitted to medical, surgical and intensive care units (ICUs) of four hospitals in Saudi Arabia. These hospitals include a 900-bed tertiary teaching hospital, a 400-bed private hospital, a 1400-bed large government hospital and a 350-bed small government hospital. <h3>Participants</h3> All patients (≥12 years) admitted to the study units over 4 months. <h3>Primary and secondary outcome measures</h3> Incidents were collected by pharmacists and reviewed by independent clinicians. Reviewers classified the identified incidents as ADEs, potential ADEs (PADEs) or medication errors and then determined their severity and preventability. <h3>Results</h3> We followed 4041 patients from admission to discharge. Of these, 3985 patients had complete data for analysis. The mean±SD age of patients in the analysed cohort was 43.4±19.0 years. A total of 1676 ADEs were identified by pharmacists during the medical chart review. Clinician reviewers accepted 1531 (91.4%) of the incidents identified by the pharmacists (245 ADEs, 677 PADEs and 609 medication errors with low risk of causing harm). The incidence of ADEs was 6.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 6.9) per 100 admissions and 7.9 (95% CI 6.9 to 8.9) per 1000 patient-days. The occurrence of ADEs was most common in ICUs (149 (60.8%)) followed by medical (67 (27.3%)) and surgical (29 (11.8%)) units. In terms of severity, 129 (52.7%) of the ADEs were significant, 91 (37.1%) were serious, 22 (9%) were life-threatening and three (1.2%) were fatal. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We found that ADEs were common in Saudi hospitals, especially in ICUs, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Future studies should focus on investigating the root causes of ADEs at the prescribing stage, and development and testing of interventions to minimise harm from medications.

AB  - Objectives To describe the essential components of an Agile Implementation (AI) process, which rapidly and effectively implements evidence‐based healthcare solutions, and present a case study demonstrating its utility. Design Case demonstration study. Setting Integrated, safety net healthcare delivery system in Indianapolis. Participants Interdisciplinary team of clinicians and administrators. Measurements Reduction in dementia symptoms and caregiver burden; inpatient and outpatient care expenditures. Results Implementation scientists were able to implement a collaborative care model for dementia care and sustain it for more than 9 years. The model was implemented and sustained by using the elements of the AI process: proactive surveillance and confirmation of clinical opportunities, selection of the right evidence‐based healthcare solution, localization (i.e., tailoring to the local environment) of the selected solution, development of an evaluation plan and performance feedback loop, development of a minimally standardized operation manual, and updating such manual annually. Conclusion The AI process provides an effective model to implement and sustain evidence‐based healthcare solutions.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of simple and elaborated health care provider (HCP) reminder prompts on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation rates.Twenty-nine pediatric HCPs serving 5 pediatric clinics were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: 1) usual practice control, 2) simple reminder prompt, and 3) elaborated reminder prompt, which included suggested language for recommending the early adolescent platform vaccines. Prompts were delivered via a computer-based clinical decision support system deployed in the 5 clinics. Eligible patients were ages 11 to 13 years, had not received HPV vaccine, and were due for meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine and/or the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster (Tdap). Receipt of HPV vaccine was determined via automated queries sent to the Indiana immunization registry. Data were analyzed via logistic regression models, with generalized estimating equations used to account for the clustering of patients within HCPs.Ten HCPs in the control group saw 301 patients, 8 HCPs in the simple prompt group saw 124, and 11 HCPs in the elaborated prompt group saw 223. The elaborated prompt arm had a higher rate of HPV vaccination (62%) than the control arm (45%): adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 7.14. The simple prompt arm did not differ significantly from the control arm with respect to HPV vaccine initiation, which might have been because of the small sample size for this arm. MenACWY and Tdap rates did not vary across the 3 arms.Results suggest that an elaborated HCP-targeted reminder prompt, with suggested recommendation language, might improve rates of HPV vaccine initiation.

AB  - Mobile health technology can improve medication safety for older adults, for instance, by educating patients about the risks associated with anticholinergic medication use. This study's objective was to test the usability and feasibility of Brain Buddy, a consumer-facing mobile health technology designed to inform and empower older adults to consider the risks and benefits of anticholinergics. Twenty-three primary care patients aged ≥60 years and using anticholinergic medications participated in summative, task-based usability testing of Brain Buddy. Self-report usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale and performance-based usability data were collected for each task through observation. A subset of 17 participants contributed data on feasibility, assessed by self-reported attitudes (feeling informed) and behaviors (speaking to a physician), with confirmation following a physician visit. Overall usability was acceptable or better, with 100% of participants completing each Brain Buddy task and a mean System Usability Scale score of 78.8, corresponding to “Good” to “Excellent” usability. Observed usability issues included higher rates of errors, hesitations, and need for assistance on three tasks, particularly those requiring data entry. Among participants contributing to feasibility data, 100% felt better informed after using Brain Buddy and 94% planned to speak to their physician about their anticholinergic related risk. On follow-up, 82% reported having spoken to their physician, a rate independently confirmed by physicians. Consumer-facing technology can be a low-cost, scalable intervention to improve older adults’ medication safety, by informing and empowering patients. User-centered design and evaluation with demographically heterogeneous clinical samples uncovers correctable usability issues and confirms the value of interventions targeting consumers as agents in shared decision making and behavior change.

AB  - Objectives To identify risk factors for early hospital readmission in low-income community-dwelling older adults. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting University-affiliated urban safety-net healthcare system in Indianapolis, Indiana. Participants Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older with annual income less than 200% of the federal poverty level and enrolled in the Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) randomized controlled trial (N = 951). Measurements Participant health and functional status at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Early readmission was defined as a repeat hospitalization occurring within 30 days of a prior hospital discharge. Candidate risk factors included sociodemographic characteristics, health and functional status, prior care, lifestyle, and satisfaction with care. Results Of 457 index admissions in 328 participants, 85 (19%) were followed by an early readmission. The independent risk factors for early readmission identified according to regression analysis were living alone (odds ratio (OR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–2.87), fair or poor satisfaction with primary care physician (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.01–4.46), not having Medicaid (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.05–3.11), receiving a new assistive device in the past 6 months (OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.26–4.05), and staying in a nursing home in the past 6 months (OR = 5.08, 95% CI = 1.56–16.53). Age, race, sex, education, and chronic diseases were not associated with early readmission. Conclusion A broad range of nonmedical risk factors played a greater role than previously recognized in early hospital readmission of low-income seniors.

AB  - Medication safety is a global concern among healthcare providers. However, the challenges to and the future of medication safety in Saudi Arabia have not been explored. We explored the perspectives of healthcare practitioners on current issues about medication safety in hospitals and community settings in Saudi Arabia in order to identify challenges to improving it and explore the future of medication safety practice. A total of 65 physicians, pharmacists, academics and nurses attended a one-day meeting in March 2010, designed especially for the purpose of this study. The participants were divided into nine round-table discussion sessions. Three major themes were explored in these sessions, including: major factors contributing to medication safety problems, challenges to improving medication safety practice, and participants’ suggestions for improving medication safety. The round-table discussion sessions were videotaped and transcribed verbatim and analyzed by two independent researchers. The round-table discussions revealed that major factors contributing to medication safety problems included unrestricted public access to medications from various hospitals and community pharmacies, communication gaps between healthcare institutions, limited use of important technologies such as computerized provider order entry, and the lack of medication safety programs in hospitals. Challenges to current medication safety practice identified by participants included underreporting of medication errors and adverse drug reactions, multilingualism and differing backgrounds of healthcare professionals, lack of communication between healthcare providers and patients, and high workloads. Suggestions for improving medication safety practices in Saudi Arabia included continuous education for healthcare professionals and competency assessment focusing on medication safety, development of a culture that encourages medication error and adverse drug reactions reporting, use of technology proven to decrease medication errors, and promotion and implementation of national patient safety initiatives. Healthcare professionals have identified major challenges and opportunities for medication safety in Saudi Arabia. Policy makers and practitioners should consider these factors when designing future programs aimed at improving the safe use of medications.

AB  - A retrospective cohort study was conducted including 3688 patients age 60 years or older without dementia enrolled in a depression screening study in primary care clinics. Information on antidepressant use and incident dementia during follow-up was retrieved from electronic medical records. The Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the risk for incident dementia among 5 participant groups: selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) only, non-SSRI only (non-SSRI), mixed group of SSRI and non-SSRI, not on antidepressants but depressed, and not on antidepressants and not depressed. SSRI and non-SSRI users had significantly higher dementia risk than the nondepressed nonusers (hazard ratio [HR]=1.83, P=0.0025 for SSRI users and HR=1.50, P=0.004 for non-SSRI users). In addition, SSRIs users had significantly higher dementia risk than non-users with severe depression (HR=2.26, P=0.0005). Future research is needed to confirm our results in other populations and to explore potential mechanism underlying the observed association.

AB  - Communication problems between family surrogates and intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians have been documented, but few interventions are effective. Nurses have the potential to play an expanded role in ICU communication and decision making.To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the family navigator (FN), a distinct nursing role to address family members' unmet communication needs early in an ICU stay.An interprofessional team developed the FN protocol. A randomized controlled pilot intervention trial of the FN was performed in a tertiary referral hospital's ICU to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention addressed informational and emotional communication needs through daily contact by using structured clinical updates, emotional and informational support modules, family meeting support, and follow-up phone calls.Twenty-six surrogate/patient pairs (13 per study arm) were enrolled. Surrogates randomized to the intervention had contact with the FN on 90% or more of eligible patient days. All surrogates agreed that they would recom mend the FN to other families. Open-ended comments from both surrogates and clinicians were uniformly positive.Having a fully integrated nurse empowered to facilitate decision making is a feasible intervention in an ICU and is well-received by ICU families and staff. A larger randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate impact on important outcomes, such as surrogates' well-being and decision quality.

AB  - Symptoms account for more than 400 million clinic visits annually in the USA. The SPADE symptoms (sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue) are particularly prevalent and undertreated.To assess the effectiveness of providing PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System) symptom scores to clinicians on symptom outcomes.Randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2015 through May 2016 in general internal medicine and family practice clinics in an academic healthcare system.Primary care patients who screened positive for at least one SPADE symptom.After completing the PROMIS symptom measures electronically immediately prior to their visit, the 300 study participants were randomized to a feedback group in which their clinician received a visual display of symptom scores or a control group in which scores were not provided to clinicians.The primary outcome was the 3-month change in composite SPADE score. Secondary outcomes were individual symptom scores, symptom documentation in the clinic note, symptom-specific clinician actions, and patient satisfaction.Most patients (84%) had multiple clinically significant (T-score ≥ 55) SPADE symptoms. Both groups demonstrated moderate symptom improvement with a non-significant trend favoring the feedback compared to control group (between-group difference in composite T-score improvement, 1.1; P = 0.17). Symptoms present at baseline resolved at 3-month follow-up only one third of the time, and patients frequently still desired treatment. Except for pain, clinically significant symptoms were documented less than half the time. Neither symptom documentation, symptom-specific clinician actions, nor patient satisfaction differed between treatment arms. Predictors of greater symptom improvement included female sex, black race, fewer medical conditions, and receiving care in a family medicine clinic.Simple feedback of symptom scores to primary care clinicians in the absence of additional systems support or incentives is not superior to usual care in improving symptom outcomes.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02383862.

AB  - Background Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is common among patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. We evaluated whether continuous positive airway pressure for OSA among patients with recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack improved clinical outcomes. Methods and Results This randomized controlled trial among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack compared 2 strategies (standard or enhanced) for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA versus usual care over 1 year. Primary outcomes were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores. Among 252 patients (84, control; 86, standard; 82, enhanced), OSA prevalence was as follows: control, 69%; standard, 74%; and enhanced, 80%. Continuous positive airway pressure use occurred on average 50% of nights and was similar among standard (3.9±2.1 mean hours/nights used) and enhanced (4.3±2.4 hours/nights used; P =0.46) patients. In intention‐to‐treat analyses, changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores were similar across groups. In as‐treated analyses among patients with OSA, increasing continuous positive airway pressure use was associated with improved National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (no/poor, −0.6±2.9; some, −0.9±1.4; good, −0.3±1.0; P =0.0064) and improved modified Rankin Scale score (no/poor, −0.3±1.5; some, −0.4±1.0; good, −0.9±1.2; P =0.0237). In shift analyses among patients with OSA, 59% of intervention patients had best neurological symptom severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 0–1) versus 38% of controls ( P =0.038); absolute risk reduction was 21% (number needed to treat, 4.8). Conclusions Although changes in neurological functioning and functional status were similar across the groups in the intention‐to‐treat analyses, continuous positive airway pressure use was associated with improved neurological functioning among patients with acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack with OSA .

AB  - Abstract The state‐of‐the‐art triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are constructed with synthetic polymers, curtailing their application prospects and relevance in sustainable technologies. The economically viable transformation and engineering of naturally abundant materials into efficient TENGs for mechanical energy harvesting is meaningful not only for fundamental scientific exploration, but also for addressing societal needs. Being an abundant natural biopolymer, chitosan enables exciting opportunity for low‐cost, biodegradable TENG applications. However, the electrical outputs of chitosan‐based TENGs are low compared with the devices built with synthetic polymers. Here, we explore the facile molecular surface engineering in chitosan to significantly boost the performance of chitosan‐based TENG for enabling the practical applications, for example, self‐powered car speed sensor. The molecular surface engineering offers a potentially promising scheme for designing and implementing high‐performance biopolymer‐based TENGs for self‐powered nanosystems in sustainable technologies. We further explore for the first time the feasibility of data mining approaches to analyze and learn the acquired triboelectric signals from the car speed sensors and predict the relationship between the triboelectric signals and car speed values.

AB  - Introduction: Functionalsomatic disorders (FSD) are common and costly, thereby driving the need for the development of effective brief treatment options. Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) is one candidate treatment method. Objective: To review and meta-analyze, where possible, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of STPP for FSD. Methods: Following a systematic search of the literature, we performed a meta-analysis of available RCT groups to determine the effects of STPP on a range of outcomes after treatment, and medium- and long-term follow-ups. Results: In meta-analyses of 17 RCTs, STPP significantly outperformed minimal treatment, treatment as usual, or waiting list controls on somatic symptom measures at all time frames, with small to large magnitude effect sizes. Descriptive reviews of 5 RCTs suggest that STPP performed at least as well as other bona fide psychological therapies. Limitations of this meta-analysis include small samples of studies and possible publication bias. Conclusions: STPP is a valid treatment option for diverse FSD conditions resulting in somatic symptom reductions that persist over time. STPP should be included in FSD treatment guidelines.

AB  - Reducing care variability through guidelines has significantly benefited patients. Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop and evaluate a complementary approach - using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which describes a healthcare system that learns from itself.We used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining approach.A short order menu on average contained the next order (weighted average length 3.91-5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good: average AUC above 0.9 for 25% of order types and overall average AUC .714-.844 (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50-.99). Higher AUC correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent.This study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to enhance decision support.

AB  - Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) and related approaches can be used to enhance research and development of consumer-facing health information technology (IT) systems, including technologies supporting the needs of people with chronic disease. A multiphase HFE study of health IT supporting self-care of chronic heart failure by older adults is described. The study was based on HFE frameworks of “patient work” and incorporated the three broad phases of user-centered design: study or analysis, design, and evaluation. In the study phase, data from observations, interviews, surveys, and other methods were analyzed to identify gaps in and requirements for supporting heart failure self-care. The design phase applied findings from the study phase throughout an iterative process, culminating in the design of the Engage application, a product intended for continuous use over 30 days to stimulate self-care engagement, behavior, and knowledge. During the evaluation phase, a variety of usability issues through expert heuristic evaluation and laboratory-based usability testing were identified. The implications of our findings regarding heart failure self-care in older adults and the methodological challenges of rapid translational field research and development in this domain are discussed.

AB  - •The number of older ICU (intensive care unit) survivors is rapidly growing due to aging of the population and improved ICU care. •The long-term cognitive, psychological, and physical sequelae after ICU hospitalization is known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). •Many older ICU survivors suffer from long-term cognitive impairment from ICU-related delirium and mental health symptoms. •PICS-family describes the mental health symptoms that family members can experience after their loved ones are hospitalized in the ICU. •Geriatric psychiatrists may be able to play an important role in collaborative care clinics designed to care for ICU survivors. Because of the aging of the intensive care unit (ICU) population and an improvement in survival rates after ICU hospitalization, an increasing number of older adults are suffering from long-term impairments because of critical illness, known as post–intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article focuses on PICS-related cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments and the impact of ICU hospitalization on families and caregivers.

Post-Intensive Care Syndrome: The Role of Geriatric Psychiatry in Research, Practice, and PolicyThe American Journal of Geriatric PsychiatryVol. 26Issue 2PreviewWang et al.'s review1 of the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) accomplishes three goals: 1) it describes PICS as an enormous public health problem with far-reaching consequences; 2) it summarizes gaps in knowledge about functional impairments in PICS; and 3) it envisions the role of geriatric psychiatry in clinical care and research to improve patient and family outcomes in PICS. The first point cannot be overstated. PICS consists of new or worsened physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments after critical illness. Full-Text PDF

AB  - Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and accounts for substantial disability as well as increased health care costs. This study examines the minimally important difference (MID) and responsiveness of 6 commonly used anxiety scales.The sample comprised 294 patients from 6 primary care clinics in a single VA medical center who were enrolled in a telecare trial for treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid depression and/or anxiety. The measures assessed were the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4-item, 6-item, and 8-item anxiety scales; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7); the Symptom Checklist anxiety subscale (SCL); the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL); the Short Form (SF)-36 Mental Health subscale; and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS). Validity was assessed with correlations of these measures with one another and with measures of quality of life and disability. MID was estimated by triangulating several methods. Responsiveness was evaluated by comparing: (a) the standardized response means for patients who reported their mood as being better, the same, or worse at 3 months; (b) the area under the curve for patients who had improved (better) versus those who had not (same/worse).Convergent and construct validity was supported by strong correlations of the anxiety measures with one another and moderate correlations with quality of life and disability measures, respectively. All measures differentiated patients who reported global improvement at 3 months from those who were unchanged, but were less able to distinguish worsening from no change. The area under the curves showed comparable responsiveness of the scales. The estimated MID was 4 for the PROMIS scales; 3 for the GAD-7; 6 for the PCL; 9 for the SF-36 mental health subscale; 5 for the MCS score, and 0.3 for the SCL anxiety scale.Six commonly used anxiety scales demonstrate similar responsiveness, and estimated MIDs can be used to gauge anxiety change in clinical research and practice.

AB  - Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention. The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to the intervention group and 203 to the usual-care group. Intervention costs were determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years. The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 depression-free days (S.E.= 15.4; P< 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 and 0.066 quality-adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total cost of the intervention per patient was US$1189, which included physician, nurse care manager and automated monitoring set-up and maintenance costs. Incremental cost per depression-free day was US$19.72, which yields a range of US$18,018 to US$36,035 per quality-adjusted life year when converted to that metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from US$10,826 based on the modified EQ-5D to US$73,286.92 based on the SF-12. Centralized telecare management, coupled with automated symptom monitoring, appears to be a cost effective intervention for managing pain and depression in cancer patients.

AB  - Pediatric guidelines based care is often overlooked because of the constraints of a typical office visit and the sheer number of guidelines that may exist for a patient's visit. In response to this problem, in 2004 we developed a pediatric computer based clinical decision support system using Arden Syntax medical logic modules (MLM). The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation system (CHICA) screens patient families in the waiting room and alerts the physician in the exam room. Here we describe adaptation of Arden Syntax to support production and consumption of patient specific tailored documents for every clinical encounter in CHICA and describe the experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. As of this writing CHICA has served over 44,000 patients at 7 pediatric clinics in our healthcare system in the last decade and its MLMs have been fired 6182,700 times in “produce” and 5334,021 times in “consume” mode. It has run continuously for over 10 years and has been used by 755 physicians, residents, fellows, nurse practitioners, nurses and clinical staff. There are 429 MLMs implemented in CHICA, using the Arden Syntax standard. Studies of CHICA's effectiveness include several published randomized controlled trials. Our results show that the Arden Syntax standard provided us with an effective way to represent pediatric guidelines for use in routine care. We only required minor modifications to the standard to support our clinical workflow. Additionally, Arden Syntax implementation in CHICA facilitated the study of many pediatric guidelines in real clinical environments.

AB  - Delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) is prevalent, with both delirium duration and delirium severity associated with adverse outcomes. We designed a pragmatic trial to test the efficacy of a pharmacological management of delirium (PMD) bundle in improving delirium/coma-free days and reducing delirium severity among ICU patients.A randomized pragmatic clinical trial.Medical, surgical, and progressive ICUs of three tertiary care hospitals.A total of 351 critically ill patients.A multicomponent PMD bundle consisting of reducing the exposure to 20 definite anticholinergic medications and benzodiazepines and prescribing low-dose haloperidol.The primary outcomes were delirium/coma-free days, measured through the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), and delirium severity, measured through Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 and the CAM-ICU-7. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital and posthospital discharge 30-day mortality, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and delirium-related hospital complications.We randomized 351 critically ill delirious patients (mean age = 59.3 years [SD = 16.9 years]; 52% female, 42% African Americans) to receive the PMD bundle or usual care. There were no significant differences in median delirium/coma-free days at day 8 (PMD vs usual care = 4 [interquartile range {IQR} = 2-7] days vs 5 [IQR = 1-7] days; P = .888) or at day 30 (PMD vs usual care = 26 [IQR 19-29] days vs 26 [IQR, 14-29] days; P = .991). There were no significant differences for decrease in delirium severity at day 8, but at hospital discharge, the intervention group showed a greater reduction in delirium severity (mean decrease in CAM-ICU-7 score for PMD vs usual care = 3.2 [SD = 3.3] vs 2.5 [SD = 3.2]; P = .046). No differences were observed between groups for ICU and hospital lengths of stay, mortality, and delirium-related hospital complications. Similar results were observed when analyses were limited to patients 65 years or older and 75 years or older.Implementing the PMD bundle in the ICU did not reduce delirium duration or severity among critically ill patients.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00842608.

AB  - Background The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer has increased substantially during the past 15 years, which is likely related to an increased detection of small, nonlethal cancers. Studies have shown that patients may have a similar prognosis when undergoing less aggressive surgical intervention, such as thyroid lobectomy. The objective of this study is to determine whether surgical treatment patterns for papillary thyroid cancer have changed during the past 15 years. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating changes in the incidence and proportion of total thyroidectomy versus thyroid lobectomy for histologically confirmed papillary thyroid cancers, using the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries between 2000 and 2014. Results During the study period, 44,537 patients underwent surgical treatment for papillary thyroid cancer, of which 77% were female and 81.3% were white. The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer more than doubled: from 6.2 (5.9–6.5) to 13.0 (12.5–13.4) per 100,000. The proportion of total thyroidectomy among all papillary cases increased from 78.16% in 2000 to 85.67% in 2014, and the proportion of thyroid lobectomy dropped from 16.62% to 11.41%. When stratified by tumor size, we observed a sustained and increasing gap in the proportions of total thyroidectomy and thyroid lobectomy. Conclusion The incidence of total thyroidectomy has not decreased despite recommendations encouraging consideration of lobectomy for patients with small papillary thyroid cancers. Although these findings could be attributed to the lag between scientific evidence and clinical practice, further work is warranted to explore any additional patient and provider factors that may explain this lack of change.

AB  - Background Street-connected youth are a neglected and vulnerable population, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The development of interventions and supports for this population requires insight into how they live. This study describes the social and economic characteristics of a convenience sample of street youth (SY) in Eldoret, Kenya. Methods Participants were eligible if they were aged 12–21, living in Eldoret, spending days only (part-time), or nights and days on the street (full-time) and able and willing to consent or assent. Data were collected using a standardized interview conducted in English or Kiswahili. Binary dependent variables were having been arrested and/or jailed, and first priority for spending money (food vs. other). Nominal categorical dependent variables included major source of support, and major reason for being street-involved. Multivariable analysis used logistic regression models to examine the association of gender and level of street-involvement with social and economic factors of interest adjusting for age and length of time on the street. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.3. Results Of the 200 SY enrolled, 41% were female, mean age of 16.3 years; 71% were on the street full-time, and 29% part-time. Compared with part-time SY, full-time SY were more likely to have been arrested (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.33, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]:1.01–5.35), name food as their first spending priority (AOR: 2.57, 95%CI:1.03–6.45), have left home due to violence (AOR: 5.54, 95%CI: 1.67–18.34), and more likely to report friends on the street as a major source of support (AOR: 3.59, 95% CI: 1.01–12.82). Compared with females, males were more likely to have ever been arrested (AOR: 2.66, 95%CI:1.14–6.18), and to have ever been jailed (AOR: 3.22, 95%CI:1.47–7.02). Conclusions These results suggest a high degree of heterogeneity and vulnerability among SY in this setting. There is an urgent need for interventions taking into consideration these characteristics.

AB  - Objectives To describe processes and preliminary outcomes from the implementation of a systematic advance care planning ( ACP ) intervention in the nursing home setting. Design Specially trained project nurses were embedded in 19 nursing homes and engaged in ACP as part of larger demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Setting Nursing homes. Participants Residents enrolled in the demonstration project for a minimum of 30 days between August 2013 and December 2014 (n = 2,709) and residents currently enrolled in March 2015 (n = 1,591). Measurements ACP conversations were conducted with residents, families, and the legal representatives of incapacitated residents using a structured ACP interview guide with the goal of offering ACP to all residents. Project nurses reviewed their roster of currently enrolled residents in March 2015 to capture barriers to engaging in ACP . Results During the initial implementation phase, 27% (731/2,709) of residents had participated in one or more ACP conversations with a project nurse, resulting in a change in documented treatment preferences for 69% (504/731). The most common change (87%) was the generation of a Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment form. The most frequently reported barrier to ACP was lack of time. Conclusion The time‐ and resource‐intensive nature of robust ACP must be anticipated when systematically implementing ACP in the nursing home setting. The fact that these conversations resulted in changes over 2/3 of the time reinforces the importance of deliberate, systematic ACP to ensure that current treatment preferences are known and documented so that these preferences can be honored.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement is an important component of the research process for improving the use and uptake of patient-centered health care innovations. Participatory design (PD), a method that utilizes the involvement of patients and other stakeholders, is well-suited for the design of multifaceted interventions in complex work systems, such as community pharmacies, that have diverse and dynamic end-users. The objective is to describe a blueprint for how to use PD when designing a community pharmacy intervention. This paper outlines the steps of PD and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of this method. PD is explained step-wise to underscore the considerations required of researchers unfamiliar with PD. This includes the development of a tailored PD approach, PD session preparatory work, data collection, and intervention development and evaluation. The stakeholders recruited for the community pharmacy intervention were pharmacy staff and older adult patients who received prescriptions at the pharmacy corporation in which the intervention was being implemented. The PD process was a series of six adaptive sessions: (1) problem identification, (2) solution generation, (3) convergence, (4) prototyping, (5) initial evaluation, and (6) formative evaluation. A description of the PD process to design a community pharmacy intervention is provided. The process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. The advantages of using PD included the opportunity to clarify problems faced by stakeholders, generation of novel solutions to incorporate into the intervention, and the ability to vet and fine-tune stakeholder design ideas in an iterative fashion. The insight gained was unprecedented and invaluable to the researchers. The biggest challenge of employing PD was the time-sensitive and time-intensive nature of developing each session, collecting data, and reflecting on the results in order to design subsequent sessions. The PD process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. PD enabled stakeholders to generate creative solutions and provide unique insight on addressing issues faced in healthcare redesign research and specifically in community pharmacies.

AB  - Abstract Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems typically define laboratory test results using the Laboratory Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC) and can transmit them using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standards. LOINC has not yet been semantically integrated with computational resources for phenotype analysis. Here, we provide a method for mapping LOINC-encoded laboratory test results transmitted in FHIR standards to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. We annotated the medical implications of 2923 commonly used laboratory tests with HPO terms. Using these annotations, our software assesses laboratory test results and converts each result into an HPO term. We validated our approach with EHR data from 15,681 patients with respiratory complaints and identified known biomarkers for asthma. Finally, we provide a freely available SMART on FHIR application that can be used within EHR systems. Our approach allows readily available laboratory tests in EHR to be reused for deep phenotyping and exploits the hierarchical structure of HPO to integrate distinct tests that have comparable medical interpretations for association studies.

AB  - Social determinants of health are critical drivers of health status and cost, but are infrequently screened or addressed in primary care settings. Systematic approaches to identifying individuals with unmet social determinants needs could better support practice workflows and linkages of patients to services. A pilot study examined the effect of a risk-stratification tool on referrals to services that address social determinants in an urban safety-net population.An intervention that risk stratified patients according to the need for wraparound was evaluated in a stepped wedge design (i.e., phased implementation at the clinic level during 2017). Staff at nine federally qualified health centers received a daily report predicting patients' needs for social worker, dietitian, behavioral health, and other wraparound services (categorized as low, rising, or high risk). Outcomes included referrals and uptake of appointments to wraparound services.Among 238,087 encounters, providing clinic staff with risk-stratification scores increased the odds that a patient would be referred to a social worker. For patients categorized as high risk, the odds of a social work referral was 65% higher than controls and similar patients, but lower effect sizes were observed for individuals categorized with rising and low risk. Among referred patients, the intervention was generally associated with increased odds of kept appointments.This study provided preliminary evidence that risk-stratification interventions to identify patients in need of wraparound services to address social determinants can increase referrals and uptake of services that may address social drivers of disease burden.

AB  - Background & Aims Several strategies are available for detecting cirrhosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but their cost effectiveness is not clear. We developed a decision model to quantify the accuracy and costs of 9 single or combination strategies, including 3 noninvasive tests (fibrosis-4 [FIB-4], vibration-controlled transient elastography [VCTE], and magnetic resonance elastography [MRE]) and liver biopsy, for the detection of cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD. Methods Data on the diagnostic accuracy, costs, adverse events, and cirrhosis outcomes over a 5-year period were obtained from publications. The diagnostic accuracy, per-patient cost per correct diagnosis of cirrhosis, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each strategy for base cirrhosis prevalence values of 0.27%, 2%, and 4%. Results The combination of the FIB-4 and VCTE identified patients with cirrhosis in NAFLD populations with a 0.27%, 2%, and 4% prevalence of cirrhosis with the lowest cost per person ($401, $690, and $1024, respectively) and highest diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, 88.5%, and 87.5% respectively). The combination of FIB-4 and MRE ranked second in cost per person ($491, $781, and $1114, respectively) and diagnostic accuracy (92.4%, 91.6%, 90.6%, respectively). Compared with the combination of FIB-4 and VCTE (least costly), the ICERs were lower for the combination of FIB-4 and MRE ($2864, $2918, and $2921) than the combination of FIB-4 and liver biopsy ($4454, $5156, and $5956) at the cirrhosis prevalence values tested. When the goal was to avoid liver biopsy, FIB-4 + VCTE and FIB-4 + MRE had similar diagnostic accuracies, ranging from 87.5% to 89.3% and 90.6% to 92.4% for a cirrhosis diagnosis, respectively, although FIB-4 + MRE had a slightly higher cost. Conclusions In our cost-effectiveness analysis based on the US health care system, we found that results from FIB-4, followed by either VCTE, MRE, or liver biopsy, detect cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD with a high level of accuracy and low cost. Compared with FIB-4 + VCTE, which was the least costly strategy, FIB-4 + MRE had a lower ICER than FIB-4 + LB.

AB  - Context: Existing hospitalization ratios for COVID-19 typically use case counts in the denominator, which problematically underestimates total infections because asymptomatic and mildly infected persons rarely get tested. As a result, surge models that rely on case counts to forecast hospital demand may be inaccurately influencing policy and decision-maker action. Objective: Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. Design: Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. Setting: State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. Results: The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age. Conclusions: In this first study of the IHR based on population prevalence, our results can improve forecasting models of hospital demand—especially in preparation for the upcoming winter period when an increase in SARS CoV-2 infections is expected.

AB  - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wake-up stroke (WUS) accounts for a quarter of all ischemic strokes. Its conspicuous occurrence during sleep suggests that WUS may be associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We investigated the potential association among WUS, OSA, and measures of sympathetic hyperactivity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Sleep Apnea in Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke (SLEEP TIGHT) study. Ischemic stroke patients were divided into WUS and non-WUS groups. Participants underwent polysomnography and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Collected data included demographic, medical, stroke characteristics (including severity by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), cholesterol, serum catecholamines, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, B-type natriuretic peptide, blood pressure, and polysomnographic (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI); measures of hypoxia). Because both stroke and OSA affect men and women to varying degrees, the cohort was considered as a whole and by gender stratification. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among 164 participants, 30.3% had WUS. The mean age was 62.0 ± 11.3 and the mean body mass index was 30.2 ± 7.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. One-hundred-and-five participants (63.6%) were males and 92 participants (56.8%) were Caucasian. Neither AHI nor OSA (AHI ≥5) frequency differed between WUS and non-WUS groups. Men tended to be more likely than women to have WUS (74.0 vs. 59.6%; p = 0.08), but this was not statistically significant. In gender-stratified analyses, men with WUS compared to men with non-WUS had significantly higher rates of severe OSA (AHI &gt;30: 45.0 vs. 17.6%; p = 0.03) and tended toward more 3% oxygen desaturation events (57.0 ± 63.9 vs. 31.8 ± 22.9; p = 0.06). These differences were not seen in women. WUS patients tended to be of the male gender (74.0 vs. 59.6%; p = 0.08). History of stroke, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or atrial fibrillation, serum catecholamines, and inflammatory biomarkers was no different between the groups. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly higher in WUS (114.5 ± 36.3 vs. 101.4 ± 37.6; p = 0.04). Baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly greater in the WUS group. There was no difference in systolic or ambulatory blood pressure (including nighttime blood pressure) between WUS and non-WUS groups. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; WUS may be associated with severe OSA with more oxygen desaturation in men but not in women. WUS may be associated with high DBP and increased LDL cholesterol.

AB  - We conducted a randomized controlled trial of an individually tailored, virtual perspective-taking intervention to reduce race and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in providers' pain treatment decisions. Physician residents and fellows (n = 436) were recruited from across the United States for this two-part online study. Providers first completed a bias assessment task in which they made treatment decisions for virtual patients with chronic pain who varied by race (black/white) and SES (low/high). Providers who demonstrated a treatment bias were randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of personalized feedback about their bias, real-time dynamic interactions with virtual patients, and videos depicting how pain impacts the patients' lives. Treatment bias was re-assessed 1 week later. Compared with the control group, providers who received the tailored intervention had 85% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against black patients and 76% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against low SES patients at follow-up. Providers who received the intervention for racial bias also showed increased compassion for patients compared with providers in the control condition. Group differences did not emerge for provider comfort in treating patients. Results suggest an online intervention that is tailored to providers according to their individual treatment biases, delivers feedback about these biases, and provides opportunities for increased contact with black and low SES patients, can produce substantial changes in providers' treatment decisions, resulting in more equitable pain care. Future studies should examine how these effects translate to real-world patient care and the optimal timing/dose of the intervention.

AB  - Perinatal depression (PND) is a prevalent and disabling problem both during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The legacy screening measure has been the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). This systematic review examines the validity of the PHQ-9 as a screener for PND.The following databases were searched from January 2001 (when the PHQ-9 was first published) through June 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychInfo. Studies that compared the PHQ-9 to a criterion standard psychiatric interview were used to determine the operating characteristics of sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC). Studies comparing the PHQ-9 to the EPDS and other depression scales evaluated convergent validity.A total of 35 articles were eligible for criterion (n = 10) or convergent (n = 25) validity. Meta-analysis of the 7 criterion validity studies using the standard PHQ-9 cut point ≥10 showed a pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of 0.84, 0.81 and 0.89, respectively. Operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 and EPDS were nearly identical in head-to-head comparison studies. The median correlation between the PHQ-9 and EPDS was 0.59, and categorical agreement was moderate.The PHQ-9 appears to be a viable option for perinatal depression screening with operating characteristics similar to the legacy EPDS.

AB  - As people are living longer, dementia is becoming a significant issue for society. Dementia is now recognised as a major concern in society, and the numbers of people estimated to have dementia in the UK population appear to have stabilised at around 700,000 . Globally, 35.6 million people are estimated to meet criteria for dementia, a number predicted to double every 20 years . Given the absence of treatments that significantly alter the natural history of the clinical syndrome of dementia, there has been increased emphasis on early diagnosis, with research exploring assessment tools and biomarkers that might predict with certainty a particular clinical outcome. At the same time, there has been pressure to focus on biomedical profiles, which assume a very close link between the pathobiology and the manifest clinical syndrome.

AB  - We describe perceived physician communication behaviors and its association with adherence to care, among HIV patients in Kenya. This cross-sectional study was conducted between July and August 2011. The study was conducted in three adult HIV clinics within the Academic Model Providing Healthcare program in western Kenya. HIV adult patients. Patient's predisposition to attend clinic, missed appointment and missed combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) medication. A total of 400 patients were enrolled and participated in the study; the median age was 38 years (IQR = 33–44) and 56.5% were female. Patients perceived physicians engaged in a high number of communication behaviors (mean = 3.80, range 1–5). A higher perceived general health status (P = 0.01), shorter distance to the health facility (P = 0.03) and lesser time spent at the health facility (P = 0.02) were associated with a higher number of perceived physician communication behaviors. Physician–patient relationship factors were not associated with physician communication behaviors. In addition, a higher number of perceived physician communication behaviors was associated with a very high likelihood of patients' attending the next HIV clinic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49–2.40], a lower likelihood of patients' missing an appointment (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61–0.92) and missing cART medication (AOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52–0.87). Patients' perception of physician communication behaviors was found to be associated with their adherence to HIV care.

AB  - The Patient Health Questionnaire – 15 (PHQ-15) and the Somatic Symptom Scale – 8 (SSS-8) are self-report measures which assess somatic symptom burden. The present study investigates whether the two measures are comparable in terms of their psychometric properties and estimates of symptom burden. Item characteristics, reliability, symptom severity and construct validity with regard to other relevant psychological, health-related quality of life and disability measures were compared for the PHQ-15m and the SSS-8 in 294 primary care patients who participated in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial targeting pain and mood symptoms. The reliabilities of the PHQ-15m and the SSS-8 were α = 0.66 and α = 0.72, respectively. Both measures were highly correlated (r = 0.79). All item characteristics were comparable and both instruments showed the same pattern of correlations with instruments measuring depression, anxiety, pain, quality of life and impairment (r = 0.25 to 0.53). A 1-point score increase (worsening of somatic symptoms) on either instrument resulted in a 3.7% to 3.9% increase in the number of disability days reported for the last four weeks. Using the same severity thresholds (5: low, 10: medium, 15: high), both measures identified nearly identical subgroups of patients with regard to health-related quality of life and disability. The PHQ-15m and the SSS-8 are comparable measures in terms of reliability and validity and severity classifications. These findings are in line with previous results and support the use of the SSS-8 as a valuable and short alternative to the original PHQ-15 in settings with limited assessment time.

AB  - Cancer patients have high rates of persistent and disabling symptoms. Evidence suggests that social constraints (e.g., avoidance and criticism) negatively impact symptoms, but pathways linking these variables have yet to be identified. This study examined whether cancer-related loneliness (i.e., feeling socially disconnected related to having cancer) mediated the relationships between social constraints and symptoms (i.e., pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive complaints) in patients with various cancers (N = 182). Patients (51% female, mean age = 59) were recruited from the Indiana Cancer Registry and completed questionnaires assessing social constraints, cancer-related loneliness, and symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the hypothesized relationships among variables. The model demonstrated good fit. Consistent with our hypothesis, cancer-related loneliness mediated the relationships between social constraints and each symptom. Findings suggest that addressing cancer-related loneliness in symptom management interventions may mitigate the negative impact of social constraints on outcomes.

AB  - Objectives To describe the relationship between nursing facility resident risk conditions and signs and symptoms at time of acute transfer and diagnosis of conditions associated with potentially avoidable acute transfers (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, dehydration, pressure sores). Design As part of a demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers, Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project clinical staff collected data on residents who transferred to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Cross‐tabulations were used to identify associations between risk conditions or symptoms and hospital diagnoses or death. Mixed‐effects logistic regression models were used to describe the significance of risk conditions, signs, or symptoms as predictors of potentially avoidable hospital diagnoses or death. Setting Indiana nursing facilities (N=19). Participants Long‐stay nursing facility residents (N=1,174), who experienced 1,931 acute transfers from November 2014 to July 2016. Measurements Participant symptoms, transfers, risk factors, and hospital diagnoses. Results We found that 44% of acute transfers were associated with 1 of 6 potentially avoidable diagnoses. Symptoms before transfer did not discriminate well among hospital diagnoses. Symptoms mapped into multiple diagnoses and most hospital diagnoses had multiple associated symptoms. For example, more than two‐thirds of acute transfers of residents with a history of CHF and COPD were for reasons other than exacerbations of those two conditions. Conclusion Although it is widely recognized that many transfers of nursing facility residents are potentially avoidable, determining “avoidability” at time of transfer is complex. Symptoms and risk conditions were only weakly predictive of hospital diagnoses.

AB  - Background and objective Electronic health records databases are increasingly used for identifying cohort populations, covariates, or outcomes, but discerning such clinical ‘phenotypes’ accurately is an ongoing challenge. We developed a flexible method using overlapping (Venn diagram) queries. Here we describe this approach to find patients hospitalized with acute congestive heart failure (CHF), a sampling strategy for one-by-one ‘gold standard’ chart review, and calculation of positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivities, with SEs, across different definitions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To identify the top priority areas for research to optimize pharmacotherapy in older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN Consensus meeting. SETTING Multidisciplinary workshop supported by the National Institute on Aging, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Geriatrics Society, February 6–7, 2017. PARTICIPANTS Leaders in the Cardiology and Geriatrics communities, (officers in professional societies, journal editors, clinical trialists, Division chiefs), representatives from the NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Food and Drug Administration; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine, Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, pharmaceutical industry, and trainees and early career faculty with interests in geriatric cardiology. MEASUREMENTS Summary of workshop proceedings and recommendations. RESULTS To better align older adults’ healthcare preferences with their care, research is needed to improve skills in patient engagement and communication. Similarly, to coordinate and meet the needs of older adults with multiple comorbidities encountering multiple healthcare providers and systems, systems and disciplines must be integrated. The lack of data from efficacy trials of CVD medications relevant to the majority of older adults creates uncertainty in determining the risks and benefits of many CVD therapies; thus, developing evidence‐based guidelines for older adults with CVD is a top research priority. Polypharmacy and medication nonadherence lead to poor outcomes in older people, making research on appropriate prescribing and deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy and methods to improve adherence to beneficial therapies a priority. CONCLUSION The needs and circumstances of older adults with CVD differ from those that the current medical system has been designed to meet. Optimizing pharmacotherapy in older adults will require new data from traditional and pragmatic research to determine optimal CVD therapy, reduce polypharmacy, increase adherence, and meet person‐centered goals. Better integration of the multiple systems and disciplines involved in the care of older adults will be essential to implement and disseminate best practices. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:371–380, 2019.

AB  - Interoperable health information technologies, like electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchange (HIE), provide greater access to patient information from across multiple organizations. Also, an increasing number of public data sources exist to describe social determinant of health factors. These data may help better inform risk prediction models, but the relative importance or value of these data has not been established. This study assessed the performance of different classes of information individually, and in combination, in predicting emergency department (ED) revisits. In a sample of 279,611 adult ED encounters. We compared the performance of Two-Class Boosted Decision Trees machine learning algorithm using 5 classes of information: 1) social determinants of health measures only, 2) current visit EHR information only, 3) current and historical EHR information, 4) HIE information only, and 5) all available information combined. The social determinants of health measure only model had the overall worst performance with an area under the curve AUC of 0.61. The model using all information classes together had the best performance (AUC = 0.732). The model using HIE information only performed better than all other single information class models. Broad information sources, which are reflective of patients’ reliance on multiple organizations for care, better support risk prediction modeling in the emergency department.

AB  - The ability of future electronics to derive operational power from the working environment is attractive for realizing self-powered unattended electronics. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) effectively harvests the otherwise wasted ubiquitous mechanical energy. Despite the recent advances in the design and development of various triboelectric devices, these devices' output still falls short in meeting the practical needs of directly powering electronics and sensors. Here, we review the recent progress in the design and optimization strategies for improving the TENG output performance, including but not limited to theoretical simulation, materials engineering, device engineering, and power management. The ubiquitous applications of the TENGs in micro/high-voltage power source, multifunctional intelligence, blue energy harvesting, and self-powered electrochemical system are also discussed. Finally, we provide our perspectives regarding the challenges and opportunities for the future development of triboelectric devices with engineered high-performance and designer functionalities.

AB  - Nanostructured piezoelectric semiconductors offer unprecedented opportunities for high-performance sensing in numerous catalytic processes of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural interests, leveraging piezocatalysis that enhances the catalytic efficiency with the strain-induced piezoelectric field. Here, a cost-efficient, high-performance piezo-electrocatalytic sensor for detecting l-ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments, is designed and demonstrated. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and nanosheets are prepared to characterize and compare their efficacy for the piezo-electrocatalysis of AA. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting ZnO catalysts. The charge transfer between the strained ZnO nanostructures and AA is elucidated to reveal the mechanism for the related piezo-electrocatalytic process. The low-temperature synthesis of high-quality ZnO nanostructures allows low-cost, scalable production, and integration directly into wearable electrocatalytic sensors whose performance can be boosted by otherwise wasted mechanical energy from the working environment, for example, human-generated mechanical signals.

AB  - Measuring activity spaces, places adolescents spend time, provides information about relations between contextual exposures and risk behaviors. We studied whether contextual exposures in adolescents' activity spaces differ from contextual risks present in residential contexts and examined relationships between contextual exposures in activity spaces and alcohol/marijuana use.Adolescents (N = 18) aged 16-17 years carried global positioning system (GPS)-enabled smartphones for 1 week, with locations tracked. Activity spaces were created by connecting global positioning system points sequentially and adding buffers. Contextual exposure data (e.g., alcohol outlets) were connected to routes. Adolescents completed texts regarding behaviors.Adolescent activity spaces intersected 24.3 census tracts and contained nine times more alcohol outlets than that of residential census tracts. Outlet exposure in activity spaces was related to drinking. Low-socioeconomic status exposure was related to marijuana use.Findings suggest substantial differences between activity spaces and residential contexts and suggest that activity spaces are relevant for adolescent risk behaviors.

AB  - To identify challenges, lessons learned and best practices for service-oriented clinical decision support, based on the results of the Clinical Decision Support Consortium, a multi-site study which developed, implemented and evaluated clinical decision support services in a diverse range of electronic health records.Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process, a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis, including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and 91 interviews.We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework.Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards.The Clinical Decision Support Consortium successfully developed a clinical decision support service and implemented it in four different electronic health records and four diverse clinical sites; however, the process was arduous. The lessons identified by the Consortium may be useful for other developers and implementers of clinical decision support services.

AB  - This study aims to determine the prevalence of maltreatment experienced by institutionalized children prior to their admission to Charitable Children's Institutions (orphanages) in western Kenya, and to describe their socio-demographic characteristics, reasons for admission, and the factors associated with prior experiences of maltreatment.A systematic file review was undertaken in five CCIs. Demographic, prior caregiving settings and maltreatment data were extracted. Forms of maltreatment were recorded according to WHO and ISPCAN guidelines. Logistic regression was used in bivariate and multivariable analyses of factors associated with reasons for placement and forms of maltreatment.A total of 462 files were reviewed. The median (interquartile range) age of children was 6.8 (5.08) years at admission, 56% were male, and 71% had lost one or both parents. The reasons for admission were destitution (36%), abandonment (22%), neglect (21%), physical/sexual abuse (8%), and lack of caregiver (8%). The majority of child and youth residents had experienced at least one form of maltreatment (66%): physical abuse (8%), sexual abuse (2%), psychological abuse (28%), neglect (26%), medical neglect (18%), school deprivation (38%), abandonment (30%), and child labor (23%). The most common reason for non-orphans to be admitted was maltreatment (90%), whereas the most common reason for orphans to be admitted was destitution (49%). Girls (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: .61, 95% CI: .39-.95) and orphans (AOR: .04, 95% CI: .01-.17) were both independently less likely to have a history of maltreatment irrespective of whether it was the reason for admission. Children whose primary caregiver had not been a parent (AOR: .36, 95% CI: .15-.86) and orphans (AOR: .17, 95% CI: .06-.44) were less likely to have been admitted for maltreatment, while children who were separated from siblings were more likely to have been admitted for maltreatment (AOR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.01-2.60).The high prevalence of maltreatment prior to admission, particularly among nonorphans, suggests the need for better child abuse and neglect prevention programs in communities, and psychosocial support services in institutions. The significant proportion of children admitted for poverty, predominantly among orphans, indicates that community-based poverty-reduction programs might reduce the need for institutionalization.

AB  - Hypertension is the leading global risk factor for mortality. Hypertension treatment and control rates are low worldwide, and delays in seeking care are associated with increased mortality. Thus, a critical component of hypertension management is to optimize linkage and retention to care.This study investigates whether community health workers, equipped with a tailored behavioral communication strategy and smartphone technology, can increase linkage and retention of hypertensive individuals to a hypertension care program and significantly reduce blood pressure among them. The study will be conducted in the Kosirai and Turbo Divisions of western Kenya. An initial phase of qualitative inquiry will assess facilitators and barriers of linkage and retention to care using a modified Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework. Subsequently, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) usual care (community health workers with the standard level of hypertension care training); 2) community health workers with an additional tailored behavioral communication strategy; and 3) community health workers with a tailored behavioral communication strategy who are also equipped with smartphone technology. The co-primary outcome measures are: 1) linkage to hypertension care, and 2) one-year change in systolic blood pressure among hypertensive individuals. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted in terms of costs per unit decrease in blood pressure and costs per disability-adjusted life year gained.This study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies to optimize linkage and retention to hypertension care that can be applicable to non-communicable disease management in low- and middle-income countries.This trial is registered with (NCT01844596) on 30 April 2013.

AB  - We sought to estimate rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among criminal offenders in the 1 year after arrest or release from incarceration.We performed a retrospective cohort study of risk of having a positive STI (chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis) or incident-positive HIV test in the 1 year following arrest or incarceration in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana. Participants were 247,211 individuals with arrest or incarceration in jail, prison, or juvenile detention between 2003 and 2008.Test positivity rates (per 100,000 and per year) were highest for chlamydia (2968) and gonorrhea (2305), and lower for syphilis (278) and HIV (61). Rates of positive STI and HIV were between 1.5 and 2.8 times higher in female than male participants and between 2.7 and 6.9 times higher for Blacks than Whites. Compared with nonoffenders, offenders had a relative risk of 3.9 for chlamydia, 6.6 for gonorrhea, 3.6 for syphilis, and 4.6 for HIV.The 1-year period following arrest or release from incarceration represents a high-impact opportunity to reduce STI and HIV infection rates at a population level.

AB  - Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for all persons to ensure that the care they receive aligns with their values and preferences. Objective: To evaluate an ACP intervention developed to better meet the needs and priorities of persons with chronic diseases, including mild cognitive impairment. Research Design: A year-long, pre-post intervention using lay community health workers [care coordinator assistants (CCAs)] trained to conduct and document ACP conversations with patients during home health visits with pre-post evaluation. Subjects: The 818 patients were 74.2 years old (mean); 78% women; 51% African American; 43% white. Measures: Documentation of ACP conversation in electronic health record fields and health care utilization outcomes. Results: In this target population ACP documentation rose from 3.4% (pre-CCA training) to 47.9% (post) of patients who had at least 1 discussion about ACP in the electronic health record. In the 1-year preintervention period, there were no differences in admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits between patients who did and did not have ACP discussion. After adjusting for prior hospitalization and ED use histories, ACP discussions were associated with a 34% less probability of hospitalization (hazard ratios, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.97), and similar effects are apparent on ED use independent of age and prior ED use effects. Conclusions: Patients with chronic diseases including mild cognitive impairment can engage in ACP conversations with trusted home health care providers. Having ACP conversation is associated with significant reduction in seeking urgent health care and in hospitalizations.

AB  - Prescription opioids have been linked to over half of the 28,000 opioid overdose deaths in 2014. High rates of prescription opioid non-medical use have continued despite nearly all states implementing large-scale prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), which points to the need to examine the impact of state PDMP’s on curbing inappropriate opioid prescribing. In the short-term, PDMPs have been associated with short-term prescribing declines. Yet little is known about how such policies differentially impact patient subgroups or are interpreted by prescribing providers. Our objective was to compare volumes of prescribed opioids before and after Indiana implemented opioid prescribing emergency rules and stratify the changes in opioid prescribing by patient and provider subgroups. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted using data obtained from the Indiana PDMP. Prescription level data was merged with census data to characterize patient socioeconomic status. Analyses were stratified by patients’ gender, age, opioid dosage, and payer. The primary outcome indicator was the total morphine equivalent dose (MED) of dispensed opioids per day in the state of Indiana. Also considered were number of unique patients, unique providers, and prescriptions; MED per transaction and per day; and number of days supplied. After controlling for time trends, we found that total MED for opioids decreased after implementing the new emergency rules, differing by patient gender, age, and payer. The effect was larger for males than females and almost 10 times larger for 0–20 year olds as compared to the 60+ age range. Medicare and Medicaid patients experienced more decline in prescribing than patients with private insurance. Patients with prescriptions paid for by workers’ comp experienced the most significant decline. The emergency rules were associated with decline in both the number of prescribers and the number of day supply. Although the Indiana opioid prescribing emergency rules impacted statewide prescribing behavior across all individual patient and provider characteristics, the emergency rules’ effect was not consistent across patient characteristics. Further studies are needed to assess how individual patient characteristics influence the interpretation and application of state policies on opioid prescribing.

The study purpose was to evaluate responsiveness for the PROMIS-PI scales and to compare their responsiveness with legacy pain measures. We used data from 3 clinical trials totaling 759 participants. The clinical trials included patients with chronic low back pain (n = 261), chronic back or osteoarthritis pain (n = 240), and a history of stroke (n = 258). At both baseline and follow-up, participants completed PROMIS-PI scales and legacy pain measures (Brief Pain Inventory Interference scale; Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity scale; 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Bodily Pain scale; and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire). We measured global ratings of pain change, both prospectively and retrospectively, as anchors to identify patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened. Responsiveness was assessed with standardized response means, statistical tests comparing change groups, and area under the curve analysis. The PROMIS-PI scales had largely comparable responsiveness with the Brief Pain Inventory Interference and Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity scales. The 4 PROMIS-PI short forms had comparable responsiveness. For all pain questionnaires, responsiveness varied based on the study population and whether pain improved or worsened. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents 1) how responsive the PROMIS-PI scales were to detect change over time in the context of 3 clinical trials and 2) how their responsiveness compared with legacy pain measures. The findings can help researchers and clinicians choose between different patient-reported pain outcome measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE The benefits and harms of screening of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are unknown. This study addressed the question of whether the benefits outweigh the harms of screening for ADRDs among older adults in primary care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single‐blinded, two‐arm, randomized controlled trial (October 2012‐September 2016) in urban, suburban, and rural primary care settings in Indiana. A total of 4005 primary care patients (aged ≥65 years) were randomized to ADRD screening (n = 2008) or control (n = 1997). INTERVENTION Patients were screened using the Memory Impairment Screen or the Mini‐Cog and referred for a voluntary follow‐up diagnostic assessment if they screened positive on either or both screening tests. MEASUREMENTS Primary measures were health‐related quality of life (HRQOL; Health Utilities Index) at 12 months, depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven‐item scale) at 1 month. RESULTS The mean age was 74.2 years (SD = 6.9 years); 2257 (66%) were female and 2301 (67%) were white. At 12 months, we were unable to detect differences in HRQOL between the groups (effect size = 0.009 [95% confidence interval {CI} = −0.063 to 0.080]; P = .81). At 1 month, differences in mean depressive symptoms (mean difference = −0.23 [90% CI = −0.42 to ‐0.039]) and anxiety symptoms (mean difference = −0.087 [90% CI = −0.246 to 0.072]) were within prespecified equivalency range. Scores for depressive and anxiety symptoms were similar between the groups at all time points. No differences in healthcare utilization, advance care planning, and ADRD recognition by physicians were detected at 12 months. CONCLUSION We were unable to detect a difference in HRQOL for screening for ADRD among older adults. We found no harm from screening measured by symptoms of depression or anxiety. Missing data, low rates of dementia detection, and high rate of refusal for follow‐up diagnostic assessments after a positive screen may explain these findings. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:535–543, 2020

AB  - Rationale & ObjectiveThe use of kidney histopathology for predicting kidney failure is not established. We hypothesized that the use of histopathologic features of kidney biopsy specimens would improve prediction of clinical outcomes made using demographic and clinical variables alone.Study DesignRetrospective cohort study and development of a clinical prediction model.Setting & ParticipantsAll 2,720 individuals from the Biopsy Biobank Cohort of Indiana who underwent kidney biopsy between 2002 and 2015 and had at least 2 years of follow-up.New Predictors & Established PredictorsDemographic variables, comorbid conditions, baseline clinical characteristics, and histopathologic features.OutcomesTime to kidney failure, defined as sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73 m2.Analytical ApproachMultivariable Cox regression model with internal validation by bootstrapping. Models including clinical and demographic variables were fit with the addition of histopathologic features. To assess the impact of adding a histopathology variable, the amount of variance explained (r2) and the C index were calculated. The impact on prediction was assessed by calculating the net reclassification index for each histopathologic variable and for all combined.ResultsMedian follow-up was 3.1 years. Within 5 years of biopsy, 411 (15.1%) patients developed kidney failure. Multivariable analyses including demographic and clinical variables revealed that severe glomerular obsolescence (adjusted HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.51-2.03), severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (adjusted HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.52-2.59), and severe arteriolar hyalinosis (adjusted HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.14-2.05) were independently associated with the primary outcome. The addition of all histopathologic variables to the clinical model yielded a net reclassification index for kidney failure of 5.1% (P < 0.001) with a full model C statistic of 0.915. Analyses addressing the competing risk for death, optimism, or shrinkage did not significantly change the results.LimitationsSelection bias from the use of clinically indicated biopsies and exclusion of patients with less than 2 years of follow-up, as well as reliance on surrogate indicators of kidney failure onset.ConclusionsA model incorporating histopathologic features from kidney biopsy specimens improved prediction of kidney failure and may be valuable clinically. Future studies will be needed to understand whether even more detailed characterization of kidney tissue may further improve prognostication about the future trajectory of estimated glomerular filtration rate.

AB  - Evidence-based programs such as mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach can only affect health outcomes if they can be successfully implemented. However, attempts to implement programs are often limited by organizational-level factors. As part of the Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations (STOP CRC) pragmatic trial, we evaluated how organizational factors impacted the extent to which health centers implemented a mailed FIT outreach program. Eight health centers participated in STOP CRC. The intervention consisted of customized electronic health record tools and clinical staff training to facilitate mailing of an introduction letter, FIT kit, and reminder letter. Health centers had flexibility in how they delivered the program. We categorized the health centers’ level of implementation based on the proportion of eligible patients who were mailed a FIT kit, and applied configurational comparative methods to identify combinations of relevant organizational-level and program-level factors that distinguished among high, medium, and low implementing health centers. The factors were categorized according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research model. FIT tests were mailed to 21.0–81.7% of eligible participants at each health center. We identified a two-factor solution that distinguished among levels of implementation with 100% consistency and 100% coverage. The factors were having a centralized implementation team (inner setting) and mailing the introduction letter in advance of the FIT kit (intervention characteristics). Health centers with high levels of implementation had the joint presence of both factors. In health centers with medium levels of implementation, only one factor was present. Health centers with low levels of implementation had neither factor present. Full implementation of the STOP CRC intervention relied on a centralized implementation team with dedicated staffing time, and the advance mailing of an introduction letter.

AB  - A number of countries have healthcare systems where access to elective surgery is constrained. The inevitable outcome is wait lists for surgery. The objective of this study is to report cross-sectional health data collected from a broad sample of patients awaiting elective surgery and shed light on potential non-surgical treatments to improve health. Prospective cross-sectional survey of patients newly enrolled on the surgical wait list in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Multivariate regression models were used to estimate the associations between patient characteristics and health, pain and depression. Health status instruments were used to measure study participants’ general health, pain, and depression immediately after they were enrolled on the wait list for one of the targeted elective surgeries. A majority of patients reported some problems with pain or discomfort, and a large portion reported problems associated with anxiety or depression. Orthopedic patients were significantly more likely to report problems with mobility, usual activities and pain/discomfort. Neurosurgery patients were the most likely to report significant and severe depression. The high rates of pain and depression not only have implications for patients’ immediate health, but may also affect long-term surgical outcomes. This study draws attention to recognizing a wider array of morbidity, some potentially requiring non-surgical interventions, while patients wait for elective surgery. Policy options include re-examining the surgical triage system and expanding surgical capacity to match self-reported health.

AB  - Objectives To examine racial and ethnic differences in initiation and time to discontinuation of antidementia medication in Medicare beneficiaries. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Secondary analysis of 2009–10 enrollment, claims, and Part D prescription data for a 10% national sample of U.S. Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries. Participants Beneficiaries aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia ( ADRD ) before 2009 and no fills for antidementia medications in the first half of 2009 (N = 84,043). Measurements Initiation was defined as having one or more fills for antidementia medication in the second half of 2009 and discontinuation as a gap in coverage of 30 days or more during the year after initiation. The Andersen Behavioral Model was used to guide covariate selection. Results Overall, 3,481 (4.1%) of previous nonusers initiated antidementia medication in the second half of 2009. Of those initiating one drug class (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AC h EI s) or memantine), 9% later added the other class, and 2% switched classes. Of initiators, 23% discontinued within 1 month, and 62% discontinued within 1 year. Hispanic beneficiaries were more likely than white beneficiaries to initiate (adjusted odds ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.10–1.41). Black and white beneficiaries did not differ in likelihood of initiation. Hispanic (adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.34–1.82) and black ( aHR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.08–1.44) beneficiaries discontinued at a faster rate than white beneficiaries. Conclusion Initiation of antidementia medications was no different in black and white beneficiaries and more likely in Hispanic beneficiaries; black and Hispanic beneficiaries discontinued at a faster rate. More research into reasons explaining these differences is needed.

AB  - The quality of usability testing is highly dependent upon the associated usability scenarios. To promote usability testing as part of electronic health record (EHR) certification, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology requires that vendors test specific capabilities of EHRs with clinical end-users and report their usability testing process – including the test scenarios used – along with the results. The ONC outlines basic expectations for usability testing, but there is little guidance in usability texts or scientific literature on how to develop usability scenarios for healthcare applications. The objective of this article is to outline key factors to consider when developing usability scenarios and tasks to evaluate computer-interface based health information technologies. To achieve this goal, we draw upon a decade of our experience conducting usability tests with a variety of healthcare applications and a wide range of end-users, to include healthcare professionals as well as patients. We discuss 10 key factors that influence scenario development: objectives of usability testing; roles of end-user(s); target performance goals; evaluation time constraints; clinical focus; fidelity; scenario-related bias and confounders; embedded probes; minimize risks to end-users; and healthcare related outcome measures. For each factor, we present an illustrative example. This article is intended to aid usability researchers and practitioners in their efforts to advance health information technologies. The article provides broad guidance on usability scenario development and can be applied to a wide range of clinical information systems and applications.

AB  - To examine the relationship between hospital diagnoses associated with hospital transfers of long stay nursing home residents, ratings of avoidability of transfer, and RN-identified quality improvement opportunities. Prospective clinical demonstration project, named OPTIMISTIC, with trained RNs embedded in nursing homes that performed root cause analyses for 1,931 transfers to the hospital between November 2014 and July 2016. OPTIMISTIC RNs also rated whether transfers were avoidable, identified quality improvement opportunities, and recorded hospital diagnoses. Resident characteristics were obtained from Minimum Data Set assessments. Relationships between six hospital diagnoses commonly considered “potentially avoidable” and OPTIMISTIC RN root cause analysis findings were examined. Facilities were participating in the OPTIMISTIC demonstration project designed to reduce hospital transfers during the study period. Twenty-five percent of acute transfers associated with six common diagnoses were considered definitely or probably avoidable by project RNs versus 22% of transfers associated with other diagnoses. The most common quality improvement opportunity identified for transfers rated as avoidable was that the condition could have been managed safely if appropriate resources were available, a factor cited in 45% of transfers associated with any of the six diagnoses. Problems with communication among stakeholders were the most commonly noted area for improvement (48%) for transfers associated with other diagnoses. Many other areas for quality improvement were noted, including earlier detection of change in status and the need for understanding patient preferences or a palliative care plan. Although some nursing home transfers may later be deemed potentially avoidable based on post-transfer hospital diagnosis from Medicare claims data, OPTIMISTIC nurses caring for these residents at time of transfer categorized the majority of these transfers as unavoidable irrespective of the hospital diagnosis. Multiple quality improvement opportunities were identified associated with these hospital transfers, whether the transfer was considered potentially avoidable or unavoidable.

AB  - Rapid advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have produced higher-resolution cellular subtypes in multiple tissues and species. Methods are increasingly needed across datasets and species to (i) remove systematic biases, (ii) model multiple datasets with ambiguous labels and (iii) classify cells and map cell type labels. However, most methods only address one of these problems on broad cell types or simulated data using a single model type. It is also important to address higher-resolution cellular subtypes, subtype labels from multiple datasets, models trained on multiple datasets simultaneously and generalizability beyond a single model type.We developed a species- and dataset-independent transfer learning framework (LAmbDA) to train models on multiple datasets (even from different species) and applied our framework on simulated, pancreas and brain scRNA-seq experiments. These models mapped corresponding cell types between datasets with inconsistent cell subtype labels while simultaneously reducing batch effects. We achieved high accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes (weighted accuracy simulated 1 datasets: 90%; simulated 2 datasets: 94%; pancreas datasets: 88% and brain datasets: 66%) using LAmbDA Feedforward 1 Layer Neural Network with bagging. This method achieved higher weighted accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes than two other state-of-the-art methods, scmap and CaSTLe in brain (66% versus 60% and 32%). Furthermore, it achieved better performance in correctly predicting ambiguous cellular subtype labels across datasets in 88% of test cases compared with CaSTLe (63%), scmap (50%) and MetaNeighbor (50%). LAmbDA is model- and dataset-independent and generalizable to diverse data types representing an advance in biocomputing.github.com/tsteelejohnson91/LAmbDA.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - Because it is not known whether particular clusters of depressive symptoms are associated with a greater risk of adverse cardiac outcomes, we compared the utility of four clusters in predicting incident coronary artery disease (CAD) events during a 15-year period in a large cohort of primary care patients 60 years and older.Participants were 2537 primary care patients 60 years or older who were screened for depression between 1991 and 1993 and had no existing CAD diagnosis. Depressive symptoms cluster scores (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, interpersonal distress, and positive affect) were computed from responses on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale administered at baseline. CAD events, defined as the occurrence of a nonfatal acute myocardial infarction or CAD death during the follow-up period, were identified using electronic medical record and National Death Index data.There were 678 CAD events. In separate fully adjusted Cox proportional hazard models (controlling for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors), the depressed affect (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.20), somatic (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.08-1.26), and positive affect (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82-0.95) clusters each predicted CAD events. When the depressive symptom clusters were entered simultaneously into the fully adjusted model, however, only the somatic cluster remained predictive of CAD events (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23).Our findings suggest that the longitudinal relationship between overall depressive symptom severity and incident CAD events may be driven primarily by the somatic cluster.

AB  - Objective . To understand older primary care patients’ perceptions of the risks and benefits of dementia screening and to measure the association between attitudes and screening behaviors. Methods . Eligible patients completed the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) questionnaire and then were asked to undergo dementia screening by a telephone screening instrument. Results . Higher scores on the PRISM-PC questionnaire items that measure attitudes about benefits of screening were associated with decreased odds of refusing screening. Participants who refused screening had significantly lower PRISM-PC questionnaire scores on the items that measure perceived benefits compared to those who agreed to screening. Participants who refused screening were less likely to agree on screening for other conditions, such as depression and cancer. Participants who know someone with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were less likely to refuse screening. Discussion . Patients’ attitudes about the benefits of dementia screening are associated with their acceptance of dementia screening.

AB  - Regenstrief Institute developed one of the seminal computerized order entry systems, the Medical Gopher, for implementation at Wishard Hospital nearly three decades ago. Wishard Hospital and Regenstrief remain committed to homegrown software development, and over the past 4 years we have fully rebuilt Gopher with an emphasis on usability, safety, leveraging open source technologies, and the advancement of biomedical informatics research. Our objective in this paper is to summarize the functionality of this new system and highlight its novel features. Applying a user-centered design process, the new Gopher was built upon a rich-internet application framework using an agile development process. The system incorporates order entry, clinical documentation, result viewing, decision support, and clinical workflow. We have customized its use for the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department settings. The new Gopher is now in use by over 1100 users a day, including an average of 433 physicians caring for over 3600 patients daily. The system includes a wizard-like clinical workflow, dynamic multimedia alerts, and a familiar ‘e-commerce’-based interface for order entry. Clinical documentation is enhanced by real-time natural language processing and data review is supported by a rapid chart search feature. As one of the few remaining academically developed order entry systems, the Gopher has been designed both to improve patient care and to support next-generation informatics research. It has achieved rapid adoption within our health system and suggests continued viability for homegrown systems in settings of close collaboration between developers and providers.

AB  - ObjectivesTo describe emergency department (ED) utilization among long-stay nursing home residents with different levels of dementia severity.DesignRetrospective cohort study.SettingPublic Health System.ParticipantsA total of 4491 older adults (age 65 years and older) who were long-stay nursing home residents.MeasurementsPatient demographics, dementia severity, comorbidities, ED visits, ED disposition decisions, and discharge diagnoses.ResultsForty-seven percent of all long-stay nursing home residents experienced at least 1 transfer to the ED over the course of a year. At their first ED transfer, 36.4% of the participants were admitted to the hospital, whereas 63.1% of those who visited the ED were not. The median time to first ED visit for the participants with advanced stage dementia was 258 days, whereas it was 250 days for the participants with early to moderate stage dementia and 202 days for the participants with no dementia (P = .0034). Multivariate proportional hazard modeling showed that age, race, number of comorbidities, number of hospitalizations in the year prior, and do not resuscitate status all significantly influenced participants’ time to first ED visit (P < .05 for all). After accounting for these effects, dementia severity (P = .66), years in nursing home before qualification (P = .46), and gender (P = .36) lost their significance.ConclusionsThis study confirms high rates of transfer of long-stay nursing home residents, with nearly one-half of the participants experiencing at least 1 ED visit over the course of a year. Although dementia severity is not a predictor of time to ED use in our analyses, other factors that influence ED use are readily identifiable. Nursing home providers should be aware of these factors when developing strategies that meet patient care goals and avoid transfer from the nursing home to the ED.

AB  - In a randomized clinical trial, Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders ( GRACE ), a model of care that works in collaboration with primary care providers ( PCP s) and patient‐centered medical homes to provide home‐based geriatric care management focusing on geriatric syndromes and psychosocial problems commonly found in older adults, improved care quality and reduced acute care use for high‐risk, low‐income older adults. To assess the effect of GRACE at a Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Medical Center ( VAMC ), veterans aged 65 and older from Marion County, Indiana, with PCP s from four of five VAMC clinics who were not on hospice or dialysis were enrolled in GRACE after discharge home from an acute hospitalization. After an initial home‐based transition visit to GRACE enrollees, the GRACE team returned to conduct a geriatric assessment. Guided by 12 protocols and input from an interdisciplinary panel and the PCP , the GRACE team developed and implemented a veteran‐centric care plan. Hospitalized veterans from the fifth clinic, who otherwise met enrollment criteria, served as a usual‐care comparison group. Demographic, comorbidity, and usage data were drawn from VA databases. The GRACE and comparison groups were similar in age, sex, and burden of comorbidity, although predicted risk of 1‐year mortality in GRACE veterans was higher. Even so, GRACE enrollment was associated with 7.1% fewer emergency department visits, 14.8% fewer 30‐day readmissions, 37.9% fewer hospital admissions, and 28.5% fewer total bed days of care, saving the VAMC an estimated $200,000 per year after program costs during the study for the 179 veterans enrolled in GRACE . Having engaged, enthusiastic VA leadership and GRACE staff; aligning closely with the medical home; and accommodating patient acuity were among the important lessons learned during implementation.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer disease results in progressive functional decline, leading to loss of independence. Objective: To determine whether collaborative care plus 2 years of home-based occupational therapy delays functional decline. Design: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01314950) Setting: Urban public health system. Patients: 180 community-dwelling participants with Alzheimer disease and their informal caregivers. Intervention: All participants received collaborative care for dementia. Patients in the intervention group also received in-home occupational therapy delivered in 24 sessions over 2 years. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS ADL); performance-based measures included the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure (SPSM). Results: At baseline, clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between groups; the mean Mini-Mental State Examination score for both groups was 19 (SD, 7). The intervention group received a median of 18 home visits from the study occupational therapists. In both groups, ADCS ADL scores declined over 24 months. At the primary end point of 24 months, ADCS ADL scores did not differ between groups (mean difference, 2.34 [95% CI, −5.27 to 9.96]). We also could not definitively demonstrate between-group differences in mean SPPB or SPSM values. Limitation: The results of this trial are indeterminate and do not rule out potential clinically important effects of the intervention. Conclusion: The authors could not definitively demonstrate whether the addition of 2 years of in-home occupational therapy to a collaborative care management model slowed the rate of functional decline among persons with Alzheimer disease. This trial underscores the burden undertaken by caregivers as they provide care for family members with Alzheimer disease and the difficulty in slowing functional decline.

AB  - Most prior studies use objectively measured data (e.g., census-based indicators) to assess contextual risks. However, teens' observations might be more important for their risk behavior. Objectives: 1) determine relationships between observed and objective indicators of contextual risks 2) determine relations of observed and objective indicators with teen alcohol use and problem behavior. Teens aged 14–16 (N=170) carried GPS-enabled smartphones for one month, with locations documented. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measured teens' observations via texts regarding risk behaviors and environmental observations. Objective indicators of alcohol outlets and disorganization were spatially joined to EMAs based on teens' location at the time of the texts. Observed and objective disorganization, and objective indicators of alcohol outlets were related to alcohol use. Observed disorganization was related to problem behavior, while objective indicators were unrelated. Findings suggest the importance of considering teens' observations of contextual risk for understanding influences on risk behavior and suggest future directions for research and prevention strategies.

AB  - Importance Pregnant people are at high risk for severe COVID-19 but were excluded from mRNA vaccine trials; data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) are needed. Objective To evaluate the estimated effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against medically attended COVID-19 among pregnant people during Delta and Omicron predominance. Design, Setting, and Participants This test-negative, case-control study was conducted from June 2021 to June 2022 in a network of 306 hospitals and 164 emergency department and urgent care (ED/UC) facilities across 10 US states, including 4517 ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations among pregnant people with COVID-19–like illness (CLI) who underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Exposures Two doses (14-149 and ≥150 days prior) and 3 doses (7-119 and ≥120 days prior) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (≥1 dose received during pregnancy) vs unvaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures Estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounter or hospitalization, based on the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for prior vaccination; VE was calculated as (1 − aOR) × 100%. Results Among 4517 eligible CLI-associated ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations, 885 (19.6%) and 334 (34.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive, respectively; the median (IQR) patient age was 28 (24-32) years and 31 (26-35) years, 537 (12.0%) and 118 (12.0%) were non-Hispanic Black and 1189 (26.0%) and 240 (25.0%) were Hispanic. During Delta predominance, the estimated VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters was 84% (95% CI, 69% to 92%) for 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 75% (95% CI, 5% to 93%) for 2 doses 150 or more days prior, and 81% (95% CI, 30% to 95%) for 3 doses 7 to 119 days prior; estimated VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%), 96% (95% CI, 86% to 99%), and 97% (95% CI, 79% to 100%), respectively. During Omicron predominance, for ED/UC encounters, the estimated VE of 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 2 doses 150 or more days, 3 doses within 7 to 119 days, and 3 doses 120 or more days prior was 3% (95% CI, −49% to 37%), 42% (95% CI, −16% to 72%), 79% (95% CI, 59% to 89%), and −124% (95% CI, −414% to 2%), respectively; for hospitalization, estimated VE was 86% (95% CI, 41% to 97%), 64% (95% CI, −102% to 93%), 86% (95% CI, 28% to 97%), and −53% (95% CI, −1254% to 83%), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, maternal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, including booster dose, was associated with protection against medically attended COVID-19. VE estimates were higher against COVID-19–associated hospitalization than ED/UC visits and lower against the Omicron variant than the Delta variant. Protection waned over time, particularly during Omicron predominance.

AB  - Joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes have been used with increasing frequency in clinical investigations. Correct specification of fixed and random effects is essential for practical data analysis. Simultaneous selection of variables in both longitudinal and survival components functions as a necessary safeguard against model misspecification. However, variable selection in such models has not been studied. No existing computational tools, to the best of our knowledge, have been made available to practitioners. In this article, we describe a penalized likelihood method with adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) penalty functions for simultaneous selection of fixed and random effects in joint models. To perform selection in variance components of random effects, we reparameterize the variance components using a Cholesky decomposition; in doing so, a penalty function of group shrinkage is introduced. To reduce the estimation bias resulted from penalization, we propose a two-stage selection procedure in which the magnitude of the bias is ameliorated in the second stage. The penalized likelihood is approximated by Gaussian quadrature and optimized by an EM algorithm. Simulation study showed excellent selection results in the first stage and small estimation biases in the second stage. To illustrate, we analyzed a longitudinally observed clinical marker and patient survival in a cohort of patients with heart failure.

AB  - This systematic review assessed the quantitative literature to determine whether orphans are more likely to experience physical and/or sexual abuse compared to non-orphans in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It also evaluated the quality of evidence and identified research gaps. Our search identified 10 studies, all published after 2005, from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda. The studies consisted of a total 17,336 participants (51% female and 58% non-orphans). Of those classified as orphans (n = 7,315), 73% were single orphans, and 27% were double orphans. The majority of single orphans were paternal orphans (74%). Quality assessment revealed significant variability in the quality of the studies, although most scored higher for general design than dimensions specific to the domain of orphans and abuse. Combined estimates of data suggested that, compared to non-orphans, orphans are not more likely to experience physical abuse (combined OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.16]) or sexual abuse (combined OR = 1.25, 95% CI [0.88, 1.78]). These data suggest that orphans are not systematically at higher risk of experiencing physical or sexual abuse compared to non-orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. However, because of inconsistent quality of data and reporting, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Several recommendations are made for improving data quality and reporting consistency on this important issue.

AB  - To describe 12-month treatment patterns and outcomes for patients starting a new medication for fibromyalgia in routine clinical practice.Data from 1,700 patients were collected at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Repeated measures and Poisson regression models controlling for demographic, clinical, and baseline outcomes were used to assess changes in health outcomes (Brief Pain Inventory severity and interference, Sheehan Disability Scale, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), satisfaction, and economic factors for patients who initiated on pregabalin (214, 12.6%), duloxetine (264, 15.5%), milnacipran (134, 7.9%), or tricyclic antidepressants (66, 3.9%). Sensitivity analyses were run using propensity-matched cohorts.Patients started on 145 unique drugs for fibromyalgia, and over 75% of patients took two or more medications concurrently for fibromyalgia at each time point assessed. Overall, patients showed improvement on the four health outcomes, with few differences across medication cohorts. At baseline, patients reported annual averages of 20.3 visits for outpatient care, 27.7 missed days of work, and 32.6 days of care by an unpaid caregiver. The duloxetine and milnacipran (vs pregabalin or tricyclic antidepressant) cohorts had fewer outpatient visits during the 12-month study. Patients reported satisfaction with overall treatment and their fibromyalgia medication (46.0% and 42.8%, respectively).In this real-world setting, patients with fibromyalgia reported modest improvements, high resource, and medication use, and were satisfied with the care they received. Cohort differences were difficult to discern because of the high rates of drug discontinuation and concomitant medication use over the 12-month study period.

AB  - Adolescents living in HIV endemic settings face unique sexual health risks, and in the context of abject poverty, orphanhood, social marginalization, and discrimination, adolescents may be particularly at-risk of horizontal HIV transmission. Street-connected children and youth are a particularly vulnerable and marginalized population and therefore may be a key population at-risk.We sought to describe the sexual behaviours of street-connected children and youth in order to comprehend their sexual practices and elucidate circumstances that put them at increased risk of contracting HIV utilizing qualitative methods from a sample of street-connected children and youth in Eldoret, Kenya. We recruited participants aged 11-24 years who had lived on the street for ≥ 3 months to participate in 25 in-depth interviews and 5 focus group discussions stratified by age and sex.In total we interviewed 65 street-connected children and youth; 69 % were male with a median age of 18 years (IQR: 14-20.5 years). Participants identified both acceptable and unacceptable sexual acts that occur on the streets between males and females, between males, and between females. We grouped reasons for having sex into four categories based on common themes: pleasure, procreation, transactional, and forced. Transactional sex and multiple concurrent partnerships were frequently described by participants. Rape was endemic to street life for girls.These findings have important policy and programming implications, specifically for the government of Kenya's adolescent reproductive health policy, and highlight the need to target out-of-school youth. There is an urgent need for social protection to reduce transactional sex and interventions addressing the epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.

AB  - Objective Little is known about the reproductive health or family planning needs of street-connected children and youth in resource-constrained countries. The study objective was to describe how street-connected children and youth (SCCY) in Eldoret, Kenya, perceive pregnancy. Methods This qualitative study was conducted between August 2013 and February 2014. A total of 65 SCCY aged 11–24 years were purposively sampled from the three referral points: 1) A dedicated study clinic for vulnerable children and youth at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH); 2) Primary locations in which street children reside known as “bases/barracks”; and 3) Street youth community-based organizations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Content analysis was performed after thematic coding by 4 independent coders. Results The majority of SCCY interviewed were male (69%) and sexually active (81.5%). None had gone beyond primary level of education. The strong desire for SCCY to go through conventional life experiences including marriage and child bearing was evident. Sub-themes around desired pregnancies included: sense of identity with other SCCY, sense of hope, male ego, lineage, source of income, and avoiding stigmatization. The desire for children was highly gendered with male SCCY more focused on their social status in the street community, while for females it was primarily for survival on the street. Female SCCY generally lacked agency around reproductive health issues and faced gender-based violence. Abortions (either assisted or self-induced), infanticide, and child abandonment were reported. Respondents described a lucrative market for babies born to SCCY and alleged that healthcare workers were known to abduct these babies following hospital deliveries. Conclusion Our findings indicate gender differences in the reasons why SCCY become pregnant and have children. We also noted gender inequalities in reproductive health decisions. SCCY friendly interventions that provide tailored reproductive health services are needed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Depression has been associated with higher rates of mortality in medical patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of depression in medical inpatients on the rate of mortality during a prolonged follow-up period. Method This is a prospective follow-up study of a cohort of medical inpatients assessed during 1997–1998 in medical and surgical units at a tertiary university hospital in Spain and followed-up for a period ranging between 16.5 and 18 years. Eight hundred three patients were included; 420 (52.3%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 41.7 (13.8) years. Main outcome was death for any cause during follow-up. The original full Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was administered at baseline as self-report from which the PHQ-9 was derived. Depressive disorders were assessed using PHQ-9 and a structured clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition ). Results Depressive disorders as defined by PHQ-9 were detected in 206 patients (25.7%), 122 (15.2%) of them fulfilling criteria for major depression. During follow-up, 152 patients (18.9%) died. A PHQ score indicating the presence of major depressive disorder predicted increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.39–4.29), even after adjusting for important demographic and clinical variables. Similarly, the PHQ-9 score as a continuous measure of depression severity predicted increased mortality (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.10). Results were similar for clinical interview diagnoses of major depression (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.04–4.09). Conclusions Medical inpatients with a PHQ depressive disorder had a nearly 2-fold higher risk of long-term mortality, even after adjustment for several confounders. Depression severity as represented by the PHQ-9 score was also a risk factor.

AB  - Over recent decades, epidemiology has made significant contributions to our understanding of dementia, translating scientific discoveries into population health. Here, we propose reframing dementia epidemiology as "population neuroscience," blending techniques and models from contemporary neuroscience with those of epidemiology and biostatistics. On the basis of emerging evidence and newer paradigms and methods, population neuroscience will minimize the bias typical of traditional clinical research, identify the relatively homogenous subgroups that comprise the general population, and investigate broader and denser phenotypes of dementia and cognitive impairment. Long-term follow-up of sufficiently large study cohorts will allow the identification of cohort effects and critical windows of exposure. Molecular epidemiology and omics will allow us to unravel the key distinctions within and among subgroups and better understand individuals' risk profiles. Interventional epidemiology will allow us to identify the different subgroups that respond to different treatment/prevention strategies. These strategies will inform precision medicine. In addition, insights into interactions between disease biology, personal and environmental factors, and social determinants of health will allow us to measure and track disease in communities and improve population health. By placing neuroscience within a real-world context, population neuroscience can fulfill its potential to serve both precision medicine and population health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To examine changes in tooth loss and untreated tooth decay among older low‐income and higher‐income US adults and whether disparities have persisted. DESIGN Sequential cross‐sectional study using nationally representative data. SETTING The 1999 to 2004 and 2011 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PARTICIPANTS Noninstitutionalized US adults, aged 65 years and older (N = 3539 for 1999‐2004, and N = 3514 for 2011‐2016). MEASUREMENTS Differences in prevalence of tooth loss (having 19 teeth or fewer, 8 teeth or fewer, and no teeth) and untreated decay and mean number of decayed and missing teeth (DMT) between low‐ and high‐income adults 65 years and older in each survey and changes between surveys. Adjusted prevalence and count outcomes were estimated with logistic and negative binomial regression models, respectively. Models controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. Reported findings are significant at P &lt; .05. RESULTS In 2011 to 2016, unadjusted prevalence of having 19 teeth or fewer, 8 teeth or fewer, no teeth, and untreated decay among low‐income adults 65 years and older was 50.6%, 42.0%, 28.6%, and 28.6%, respectively. Multivariate analyses indicated that although most tooth loss measures improved between surveys for both income groups, tooth loss among low‐income adults remained at almost twice that among higher‐income adults. The disparity in untreated decay prevalence in 2011 to 2016, 15.2 percentage points (26.1% vs 10.9% for low vs high income) was twice that in 1999 to 2004, 8.5 percentage points (22.9% vs 14.4% for low vs high income). DMT decreased for both groups, with lower‐income adults having about five more affected teeth in both surveys. CONCLUSION Tooth loss is decreasing, but differential access to restorative care by income appears to have increased.

AB  - Websites figure predominantly in everyday life. However, many websites remain inaccessible to autistic people, and existing efforts to improve accessibility are in early stages, do not directly include autistic users in their development, or have not been empirically evaluated. The Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) used a community-based participatory research approach to create a website to improve health care access for autistic adults. We used the creation of that website as a "living laboratory" to develop the AASPIRE Web Accessibility Guidelines for Autistic Web Users. Our guidelines are grounded in accessibility theory, had autistic end-user involvement at all stages, and were empirically evaluated through a usability study and evaluation surveys. We incorporated what we learned into the design of the website, and compiled the accessibility information into a set of guidelines. The guidelines offer recommendations for increasing the physical, intellectual, and social acceptability of websites for use by autistic adults. In the evaluation of the website by 170 autistic end users, nearly all indicated it was easy to use (97%), easy to understand (95%), important (97%), and useful (96%). Ninety-two percent would recommend it to a friend, and 95% would recommend it to a health care provider. There were no significant associations between usability or understandability and education level, receipt of help using the site, browser type (e.g., IE or Safari), or device type (e.g., PC or tablet). We recommend using the guidelines to improve website accessibility for autistic Internet users.AASPIRE Web Accessibility Guideline: This guideline is a summary of the accessibility features we identified and implemented during the course of our study. None of these items were difficult or expensive for us to implement. They did not require special expertise beyond basic web programming and technical communications skills. We recommend that anyone seeking to create accessible websites for autistic users follow the Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) Web Accessibility Guideline in addition to broader web and communications standards and principles.Physical accessibility:Provide at least one low-contrast neutral color palette option to accommodate sensitive vision.Provide a selection of color palettes, including one with a dark background and one with a light background, again to accommodate color and contrast sensitivity.Provide a no-style option (i.e., no cascading style sheets (CSS) to accommodate browser customization and users who prefer no stylistic formatting.Provide simple consistent navigation and highly consistent site behavior for increased ease of operation.Avoid textured backgrounds, moving images, decorative elements that do not convey information, and other visual and/or sonic "clutter"; these types of elements may make the site difficult or impossible to comprehend.Provide smaller font sizes in addition to larger ones; large font sizes may make the page appear cluttered and difficult to read.Use a plain accessible sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for ease of readability.Intellectual accessibility:Use the simplest interface possible for ease of understanding.Use simple concrete icons or images to communicate redundant information with text, and accommodate multiple ways of understanding information.Clearly label site elements with their purpose everywhere on the site, even if it seems redundant, to make navigation and site functionality easier to follow.Provide concrete examples where applicable to accommodate difficulties in understanding abstractions or generalizations.Minimize scrolling so the user does not need to rely on assumptions about content to guess what might be on the page.Show all important features and site navigation (as opposed to within combo box drop-down areas) so the user does not need to rely on assumptions to guess whether the item exists and how to access it. For example, completely visible list boxes or radio buttons can be used instead of combo boxes.Make content as short as possible without sacrificing precision and specificity, to reduce cognitive burden.Social accessibility:Be specific and precise in language use; avoid colloquialisms, idioms, and ambiguity to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Explain the reason behind any nonstandard instructions or unusual information; provide additional pragmatic context to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Provide alternatives to definitive response items on surveys and forms, for example, "do not know," "do not wish to say," or "not applicable," to reduce frustration for not being able to produce an exact answer.Use FAQ formats to organize complex information to enhance clarity as to why the information might be useful to the user and how it connects to their life.Define terms that might have different meanings depending on social context, or which might be jargon related to a specialized field (e.g., "drug interactions" and "health care providers"), to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Be mindful of autistic culture and community preferences, including the language used to describe autism and how community-based symbols and history might influence content and perception of site credibility.

AB  - To determine the cognitive consequences of anticholinergic medications (aCH) in cognitively normal older adults as well as interactive effects of genetic and CSF Alzheimer disease (AD) risk factors.A total of 688 cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were evaluated (mean age 73.5 years, 49.6% female). Cox regression examined risk of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) over a 10-year period and linear mixed effects models examined 3-year rates of decline in memory, executive function, and language as a function of aCH. Interactions with APOE ε4 genotype and CSF biomarker evidence of AD pathology were also assessed.aCH+ participants had increased risk of progression to MCI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.47, p = 0.02), and there was a significant aCH × AD risk interaction such that aCH+/ε4+ individuals showed greater than 2-fold increased risk (HR 2.69, p < 0.001) for incident MCI relative to aCH-/ε4-), while aCH+/CSF+) individuals demonstrated greater than 4-fold (HR 4.89, p < 0.001) increased risk relative to aCH-/CSF-. Linear mixed effects models revealed that aCH predicted a steeper slope of decline in memory (t = -2.35, p = 0.02) and language (t = -2.35, p = 0.02), with effects exacerbated in individuals with AD risk factors.aCH increased risk of incident MCI and cognitive decline, and effects were significantly enhanced among individuals with genetic risk factors and CSF-based AD pathophysiologic markers. Findings underscore the adverse impact of aCH medications on cognition and the need for deprescribing trials, particularly among individuals with elevated risk for AD.

AB  - The United States has a significant shortage of trained geriatricians and of nurses, social workers, and paraprofessionals educated to care for elderly adults. As the aging population continues to grow, providing high‐quality care will require new models that better address the many needs of aging individuals and their caregivers, using cost‐effective strategies. Responding to this need, the Indiana University Center for Aging Research implementation scientists developed, tested, and are now scaling up a successful collaborative care coordination model for older adults with dementia, depression, or both: the Aging Brain Care program. This model now includes a newly created frontline care provider position, the Care Coordinator Assistant. The Care Coordinator Assistant works with individuals and caregivers to monitor biopsychosocial needs and deliver evidence‐based and individualized care protocols, with close supervision from the registered nurse Care Coordinator. Recognizing that current hiring practices for frontline providers were insufficient to screen for critical abilities expected in this new position, including the ability to express “caring” and empathy, a new screening process was created building on the Multiple Mini Interview ( MMI ) format. The Care Coordinator Assistant MMI comprised six stations, each created to simulate challenging scenarios that will be frequently encountered and to assess important candidate abilities. Overall, the six‐station MMI , with two to three items per station, provided factorially valid measures and good predictive ability. The process did not appear to be overly burdensome for candidates, and interviewers noted that it was helpful in discriminating between candidates.

AB  - Emergency departments are a major entry point for the initial management of acute heart failure (AHF) patients throughout the world. The initial diagnosis, management and disposition - the decision to admit or discharge - of AHF patients in the emergency department has significant downstream implications. Misdiagnosis, under or overtreatment, or inappropriate admission may place patients at increased risk for adverse events, and add costs to the healthcare system. Despite the critical importance of initial management, data are sparse regarding the impact of early AHF treatment delivered in the emergency department compared to inpatient or chronic heart failure management. Unfortunately, outcomes remain poor, with nearly a third of patients dying or re-hospitalised within 3 months post-discharge. In the absence of robust research evidence, consensus is an important source of guidance for AHF care. Thus, we convened an international group of practising emergency physicians, cardiologists and advanced practice nurses with the following goals to improve outcomes for AHF patients who present to the emergency department or other acute care setting through: (a) a better understanding of the pathophysiology, presentation and management of the initial phase of AHF care; (b) improving initial management by addressing knowledge gaps between best practices and current practice through education and research; and

AB  - Background: Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) forms are used to document patient treatment preferences as medical orders. Prior research demonstrates that use of POLST alters medical treatments in a way that is consistent with the POLST orders. However, there are minimal data about the quality of POLST decisions, including whether they reflect the current preferences of well-informed patients. Objective: Evaluate the quality of POLST decisions. Design: Chart abstraction; interviews. Subjects: Nursing home residents and healthcare agents of incapacitated nursing home residents (n = 28). Measurements: Characteristics of the POLST conversation were assessed. Brief vignettes were used to assess knowledge about how POLST orders guide medical treatment. Current treatment preferences were elicited and compared with the patient's POLST orders to assess discordance. Results: A majority (59%) of participants recognized the POLST form. Participants were generally accurate in their knowledge of how POLST orders guide treatment concerning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (68%), antibiotics (74%), and artificial nutrition (79%), but less so for medical interventions (50%). Current treatment preferences were initially discordant with one or more POLST orders for 64% (18/28) of participants, but half of these discordances were resolved with further discussion (e.g., participant agreed with the existing order). Discordance by treatment decision was as follows: CPR (7%), level of medical intervention (18%), antibiotics (21%), and artificial nutrition (11%). Conclusions: Discordance between current preferences and POLST orders is complex. Interventions are needed to support high-quality POLST decisions that are informed and concordant with current preferences.

AB  - At the end of life, spiritual well-being is a central aspect of quality of life for many patients and their family caregivers. A prevalent spiritual value in advanced cancer patients is the need to actively give. To address this need, the current randomized trial examined whether adding a peer helping component to a coping skills intervention leads to improved meaning in life and peace for advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients and their caregivers. Feasibility and acceptability outcomes were also assessed. Advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients and caregivers (n = 50 dyads) were randomly assigned to a 5-session, telephone-based coping skills intervention or a peer helping + coping skills intervention. One or both dyad members had moderate–severe distress. Peer helping involved contributing to handouts on coping skills for other families coping with cancer. Patients and caregivers completed measures of meaning in life/peace, fatigue, psychological symptoms, coping self-efficacy, and emotional support. Patient pain and caregiver burden were also assessed. Small effects in favor of the coping skills group were found regarding meaning in life/peace at 1 and 5 weeks post-intervention. Other outcomes did not vary as a function of group assignment, with both groups showing small decreases in patient and caregiver fatigue and caregiver distress and burden. High recruitment and retention rates supported feasibility, and high participant satisfaction ratings supported acceptability. Although a telephone-based intervention is feasible and acceptable for this population, peer helping in the context of a coping skills intervention does not enhance spiritual well-being relative to coping skills alone.

AB  - Many hospitalized adults do not have the capacity to make their own health care decisions and thus require a surrogate decision-maker. While the ethical standard suggests that decisions should focus on a patient’s preferences, our study explores the principles that surrogates consider most important when making decisions for older hospitalized patients. We sought to determine how frequently surrogate decision-makers prioritized patient preferences in decision-making and what factors may predict their doing so. We performed a secondary data analysis of a study conducted at three local hospitals that surveyed surrogate decision-makers for hospitalized patients 65 years of age and older. Surrogates rated the importance of 16 decision-making principles and selected the one that was most important. We divided the surrogates into two groups: those who prioritized patient preferences and those who prioritized patient well-being. We analyzed the two groups for differences in knowledge of patient preferences, presence of advance directives, and psychological outcomes. A total of 362 surrogates rated an average of six principles as being extremely important in decision-making; 77.8% of surrogates selected a patient well-being principle as the most important, whereas only 21.1% selected a patient preferences principle. Advance directives were more common to the patient preferences group than the patient well-being group (61.3% vs. 44.9%; 95% CI: 1.01–3.18; p = 0.04), whereas having conversations with the patient about their health care preferences was not a significant predictor of surrogate group identity (81.3% vs. 67.4%; 95% CI: 0.39–1.14; p = 0.14). We found no differences between the two groups regarding surrogate anxiety, depression, or decisional conflict. While surrogates considered many factors, they focused more often on patient well-being than on patient preferences, in contravention of our current ethical framework. Surrogates more commonly prioritized patient preferences if they had advance directives available to them.

AB  - To explore the possible association of childhood residence, education levels, and occupation with declining incidence rates of dementia in 2 cohorts of elderly African Americans.African Americans residing in Indianapolis without dementia were enrolled in 1992 and 2001 and evaluated every 2-3 years. The cohorts consist of 1,440 participants in 1992 and 1,835 participants in 2001 aged 70 years and older. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to compare cohort differences in dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.The 2001 cohort had significantly decreased risk of both incident dementia and AD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62/0.57 for dementia/AD). Years of education was associated with decreased risk of dementia (HR = 0.93; p = .0011). A significant interaction (p = .0477) between education and childhood rural residence was found for the risk of AD that higher education level is significantly associated with reduced AD risk (HR = 0.87) in participants with childhood rural residence, but no association in those with urban upbringing. The cohort difference for dementia rates were attenuated by adjusting for the 3 risk factors but remained significant (HR = 0.75; p = .04).These results emphasize the importance of early life factors including rural residence and education for the risk for dementia later in life.

All participants received feedback according to guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and were asked to discuss their level of comfort with following these guidelines.Two acute care teaching hospitals for adult patients.None.Data from transcribed interviews were analyzed using emergent thematic analysis.Participants were receptive to guidelines and believed they were useful. However, participants' responses to the case vignettes demonstrated that IDSA guideline recommendations were not routinely followed for SSTI, HAP, and ASB. We identified 3 barriers to guideline-concordant care: (1) physicians' lack of awareness of specific guideline recommendations; (2) tension between adhering to guidelines and the desire to individualize patient care; and (3) skepticism of certain guideline recommendations.Case vignettes may be useful tools to assess physician knowledge and acceptance of antibiotic-prescribing guidelines. Using case vignettes, we identified 3 barriers to following IDSA guidelines. Efforts to improve guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing should focus on reducing such barriers at the local level.

AB  - The literature about the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and stroke location is conflicting with some studies finding an association and others demonstrating no relationship. Among acute ischemic stroke patients, we sought to examine the relationship between stroke location and the prevalence of OSA; OSA severity based on apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), arousal frequency, and measure of hypoxia; and number of central and obstructive respiratory events. Data were obtained from patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial (NCT01446913) that evaluated the effectiveness of a strategy of diagnosing and treating OSA among patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Stroke location was classified by brain imaging reports into subdivisions of lobes, subcortical areas, brainstem, cerebellum, and vascular territory. The association between acute stroke location and polysomnographic findings was evaluated using logistic regression for OSA presence and negative binomial regression for AHI. Among 73 patients with complete polysomnography and stroke location data, 58 (79%) had OSA. In unadjusted models, no stroke location variable was associated with the prevalence or severity of OSA. Similarly, in multivariable modeling, groupings of stroke location were also not associated with OSA presence. These results indicate that OSA is present in the majority of stroke patients and imply that stroke location cannot be used to identify a group with higher risk of OSA. The results also suggest that OSA likely predated the stroke. Given this high overall prevalence, strong consideration should be given to obtaining polysomnography for all ischemic stroke patients.

AB  - This article identifies sources of variation in clinical workflow and implications for the design and implementation of electronic clinical decision support. Sources of variation in workflow were identified via rapid ethnographic observation, focus groups, and interviews across a total of eight medical centers in both the Veterans Health Administration and academic medical centers nationally regarded as leaders in developing and using clinical decision support. Data were reviewed for types of variability within the social and technical subsystems and the external environment as described in the sociotechnical systems theory. Two researchers independently identified examples of variation and their sources, and then met with each other to discuss them until consensus was reached. Sources of variation were categorized as environmental (clinic staffing and clinic pace), social (perception of health information technology and real-time use with patients), or technical (computer access and information access). Examples of sources of variation within each of the categories are described and discussed in terms of impact on clinical workflow. As technologies are implemented, barriers to use become visible over time as users struggle to adapt workflow and work practices to accommodate new technologies. Each source of variability identified has implications for the effective design and implementation of useful health information technology. Accommodating moderate variability in workflow is anticipated to avoid brittle and inflexible workflow designs, while also avoiding unnecessary complexity for implementers and users.

AB  - Abstract Electronic reporting of genetic testing results is increasing, but they are often represented in diverse formats and naming conventions. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) is a vocabulary standard that provides universal identifiers for laboratory tests and clinical observations. In genetics, LOINC provides codes to improve interoperability in the midst of reporting style transition, including codes for cytogenetic or mutation analysis tests, specific chromosomal alteration or mutation testing, and fully structured discrete genetic test reporting. LOINC terms follow the recommendations and nomenclature of other standards such as the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee’s terminology for gene names. In addition to the narrative text they report now, we recommend that laboratories always report as discrete variables chromosome analysis results, genetic variation(s) found, and genetic variation(s) tested for. By adopting and implementing data standards like LOINC, information systems can help care providers and researchers unlock the potential of genetic information for delivering more personalized care.

AB  - Background Many adults are discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) prior to returning home from the hospital. Patient characteristics and factors that can help to prevent postdischarge adverse outcomes are poorly understood. Objective To identify whether early post–SNF discharge care reduces likelihood of 30-day hospital readmissions. Design Secondary data analysis using the Electronic Medical Record, Medicare, Medicaid and the Minimum Data Set. Participants/setting Older (age > 65 years), community-dwelling adults admitted to a safety net hospital in the Midwest for 3 or more nights and discharged home after an SNF stay (n = 1543). Measurements The primary outcome was hospital readmission within 30 days of SNF discharge. The primary independent variables were either a home health visit or an outpatient provider visit within a week of SNF discharge. Results Out of 8754 community-dwelling, hospitalized older adults, 3025 (34.6%) were discharged to an SNF, of whom 1543 (51.0%) returned home. Among the SNF to home group, a home health visit within a week of SNF discharge was associated with reduced hazard of 30-day hospital readmission [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.61, P < .001] but outpatient provider visits were not associated with reduced risk of hospital readmission (aHR = 0.67, P = .821). Conclusion For patients discharged from an SNF to home, the finding that a home health visit within a week of discharge is associated with reduced hazard of 30-day hospital readmissions suggests a potential avenue for intervention.

AB  - The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms ranges from 17% to 44% in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. The relationship between the comorbidity of psychiatric symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors has not been carefully examined. This study examined the relationship between psychiatric comorbidities and QoL in 58 survivors of ICU delirium. Patients completed 3 psychiatric screens at 3 months after discharge from the hospital, including the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 (GAD‐7) questionnaire for anxiety, and the Post‐Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS‐10) questionnaire for posttraumatic stress disorder. Patients with 3 positive screens (PHQ‐9 ≥ 10; GAD‐7 ≥ 10; and PTSS‐10 &gt; 35) comprised the high psychiatric comorbidity group. Patients with 1 to 2 positive screens were labeled the low to moderate (low‐moderate) psychiatric comorbidity group. Patients with 3 negative screens were labeled the no psychiatric morbidity group. Thirty‐one percent of patients met the criteria for high psychiatric comorbidity. After adjusting for age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index, discharge status, and prior history of depression and anxiety, patients who had high psychiatric comorbidity were more likely to have a poorer QoL compared with the low‐moderate comorbidity and no morbidity groups, as measured by a lower EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire 3‐level Index (no, 0.69 ± 0.25; low‐moderate, 0.70 ± 0.19; high, 0.48 ± 0.24; P = 0.017). Future studies should confirm these findings and examine whether survivors of ICU delirium with high psychiatric comorbidity have different treatment needs from survivors with lower psychiatric comorbidity.

AB  - Provider burnout is a critical problem in mental health services. Contributing factors have been explicated across three domains: personal, job and organizational characteristics. Of these, organizational characteristics, including workplace environment, appear to be particularly important given that most interventions addressing burnout via the other domains (e.g. bolstering personal coping skills) have been modestly effective at best.This study builds on previous research by using social capital as a framework for the experience of work social milieu, and aims to provide a richer understanding of how workplace social environment might impact burnout and help create more effective ways to reduce burnout.Providers (n = 40) taking part in a larger burnout intervention study were randomly selected to take part in interviews regarding their workplace environment and burnout. Participant responses were analyzed thematically.Workplace social milieu revolved around two primary themes: workplace social capital in provider burnout and the protective qualities of social capital in cohesive work teams that appear to mitigate burnout.These results imply that work environments where managers support collaboration and social interaction among work teams may reduce burnout.

AB  - Objectives To examine the effect of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) on the detection of cognitive impairment and on follow‐up cognitive care for older adults. Design Retrospective matched‐cohort study. Setting United States. Participants A 5% random sample of fee‐for‐service Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled for 12 months before and after an index ambulatory visit occurring from 2011 to 2013 with no claims evidence of cognitive impairment before index. Measurements Outcomes include 12‐month post‐index visit claims‐based measurements of cognitive impairment, including new Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) diagnoses; medications for ADRD; and cognitive care‐related diagnostic examination such as neurobehavioral testing, brain imaging, and blood tests for thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH), serum B12, folate, and syphilis. We also measured changes in burden of anticholinergic medication. Results There were no clinically relevant differences between the AWV and control groups in the rates of incident ADRD diagnoses (6.16% vs 6.86%, p&lt;.001) and initiation of ADRD medications (1.00% vs 1.08%, p=.15), although there were differences favoring the AWV group in rates of TSH (39.80% vs 28.36%, p&lt;.001), B12 (9.41% vs 6.97%, p&lt;.001), folate (4.76% vs 3.72%, p&lt;.001), and neurobehavioral (0.75% vs 0.55%, p&lt;.001) testing. Conclusions Although the AWV is correlated with an increase in some measures of cognitive care, such as laboratory testing for reversible causes of cognitive impairment, it does not appear to substantially increase recognition of undetected ADRD.

AB  - To assess the efficacy of haloperidol in reducing postoperative delirium in individuals undergoing thoracic surgery.Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of tertiary care center.Individuals undergoing thoracic surgery (N=135).Low-dose intravenous haloperidol (0.5 mg three times daily for a total of 11 doses) administered postoperatively.The primary outcome was delirium incidence during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were time to delirium, delirium duration, delirium severity, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and delirium severity using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised.Sixty-eight participants were randomized to receive haloperidol and 67 placebo. No significant differences were observed between those receiving haloperidol and those receiving placebo in incident delirium (n=15 (22.1%) vs n=19 (28.4%); p = .43), time to delirium (p = .43), delirium duration (median 1 day, interquartile range (IQR) 1-2 days vs median 1 day, IQR 1-2 days; p = .71), delirium severity, ICU length of stay (median 2.2 days, IQR 1-3.3 days vs median 2.3 days, IQR 1-4 days; p = .29), or hospital length of stay (median 10 days, IQR 8-11.5 days vs median 10 days, IQR 8-12 days; p = .41). In the esophagectomy subgroup (n = 84), the haloperidol group was less likely to experience incident delirium (n=10 (23.8%) vs n=17 (40.5%); p = .16). There were no differences in time to delirium (p = .14), delirium duration (median 1 day, IQR 1-2 days vs median 1 day, IQR 1-2 days; p = .71), delirium severity, or hospital length of stay (median 11 days, IQR 10-12 days vs median days 11, IQR 10-15 days; p = .26). ICU length of stay was significantly shorter in the haloperidol group (median 2.8 days, IQR 1.1-3.8 days vs median 3.1 days, IQR 2.1-5.1 days; p = .03). Safety events were comparable between the groups.Low-dose postoperative haloperidol did not reduce delirium in individuals undergoing thoracic surgery but may be efficacious in those undergoing esophagectomy.

AB  - Objective: To characterize public health informatics (PHI) specialists and identify the informatics needs of the public health workforce. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: US local and state health agencies. Participants: Employees from state health agencies central office (SHA-COs) and local health departments (LHDs) participating in the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS). We characterized and compared the job roles for self-reported PHI, “information technology specialist or information system manager” (IT/IS), “public health science” (PHS), and “clinical and laboratory” workers. Main Outcome Measure: Descriptive statistics for demographics, income, education, public health experience, program area, job satisfaction, and workplace environment, as well as data and informatics skills and needs. Results: A total of 17 136 SHA-CO and 26 533 LHD employees participated in the survey. PHI specialist was self-reported as a job role among 1.1% and 0.3% of SHA-CO and LHD employees. The PHI segment most closely resembled PHS employees but had less public health experience and had lower salaries. Overall, fewer than one-third of PHI specialists reported working in an informatics program area, often supporting epidemiology and surveillance, vital records, and communicable disease. Compared with PH WINS 2014, current PHI respondents' satisfaction with their job and workplace environment moved toward more neutral and negative responses, while the IT/IS, PHS, and clinical and laboratory subgroups shifted toward more positive responses. The PHI specialists were less likely than those in IT/IS, PHS, or clinical and laboratory roles to report gaps in needed data and informatics skills. Conclusions: The informatics specialists' role continues to be rare in public health agencies, and those filling that role tend to have less public health experience and be less well compensated than staff in other technically focused positions. Significant data and informatics skills gaps persist among the broader public health workforce.

AB  - Objective The 5 SPADE (sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue) symptoms are among the most prevalent and disabling symptoms in clinical practice. This study evaluates the minimally important difference (MID) of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures and their correspondence with other brief measures to assess SPADE symptoms. Study Design and Setting Three hundred primary care patients completed a 4-item PROMIS scale, a numeric rating scale (NRS), and a non-PROMIS legacy scale for each of the 5 SPADE symptoms. Optimal NRS cutpoints were examined, and cross-walk units for converting legacy measure scores to PROMIS scores were determined. PROMIS scores corresponding to standard deviation (SD) and standard error of measurement (SEM) changes in legacy scores were used to estimate MID. Results At an NRS ≥5, the mean PROMIS T-score exceeded 55 (the operational threshold for a clinically meaningful symptom) for each SPADE symptom. Correlations were high (0.70–0.86) between each PROMIS scale and its corresponding non-PROMIS legacy scale. Changes in non-PROMIS legacy scale scores of 0.35 SD and 1 SEM corresponded to mean PROMIS T-scores of 2.92 and 3.05 across the 5 SPADE symptoms, with changes in 0.2 and 0.5 SD corresponding to mean PROMIS T-scores of 1.67 and 4.16. Conclusion A 2-step screening process for SPADE symptoms might use single-item NRS scores, proceeding to PROMIS scales for NRS scores ≥5. A PROMIS T-score change of three points represents a reasonable MID estimate, with two to four points approximating lower and upper bounds.

AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are commonly implanted with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices as part of their treatment. Presently, they cannot directly access the remote monitoring (RM) data generated from these devices, representing a missed opportunity for increased knowledge and engagement in care. However, electronic health data sharing can create information overload issues for both clinicians and patients, and some older patients may not be comfortable using the technology (i.e., computers and smartphones) necessary to access this data. To mitigate these problems, patients can be directly involved in the creation of data visualization tailored to their preferences and needs, allowing them to successfully interpret and act upon their health data. We held a participatory design (PD) session with seven adult patients with HF and CRT device implants, who were presently undergoing RM, along with two informal caregivers. Working in three teams, participants used drawing supplies and design cards to design a prototype for a patient-facing dashboard with which they could engage with their device data. Information that patients rated as a high priority for the “Main Dashboard” screen included average percent pacing with alerts for abnormal pacing, other device information such as battery life and recorded events, and information about who to contact with for data-related questions. Preferences for inclusion in an “Additional Information” display included a daily pacing chart, health tips, aborted shocks, a symptom list, and a journal. These results informed the creation of an actual dashboard prototype which was later evaluated by both patients and clinicians. Additionally, important insights were gleaned regarding the involvement of older patients in PD for health technology.

AB  - Electronic health record (EHR) log data capture clinical workflows and are a rich source of information to understand variation in practice patterns. Variation in how EHRs are used to document and support care delivery is associated with clinical and operational outcomes, including measures of provider well-being and burnout. Standardized measures that describe EHR use would facilitate generalizability and cross-institution, cross-vendor research. Here, we describe the current state of outpatient EHR use measures offered by various EHR vendors, guided by our prior conceptual work that proposed seven core measures to describe EHR use. We evaluate these measures and other reporting options provided by vendors for maturity and similarity to previously proposed standardized measures. Working toward improved standardization of EHR use measures can enable and accelerate high-impact research on physician burnout and job satisfaction as well as organizational efficiency and patient health.

AB  - The value of utilizing a multigene pharmacogenetic panel to tailor pharmacotherapy is contingent on the prevalence of prescribed medications with an actionable pharmacogenetic association. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has categorized over 35 gene-drug pairs as "level A," for which there is sufficiently strong evidence to recommend that genetic information be used to guide drug prescribing. The opportunity to use genetic information to tailor pharmacotherapy among adult patients was determined by elucidating the exposure to CPIC level A drugs among 11 Implementing Genomics In Practice Network (IGNITE)-affiliated health systems across the US. Inpatient and/or outpatient electronic-prescribing data were collected between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016 for patients ≥ 18 years of age who had at least one medical encounter that was eligible for drug prescribing in a calendar year. A median of ~ 7.2 million adult patients was available for assessment of drug prescribing per year. From 2011 to 2016, the annual estimated prevalence of exposure to at least one CPIC level A drug prescribed to unique patients ranged between 15,719 (95% confidence interval (CI): 15,658-15,781) in 2011 to 17,335 (CI: 17,283-17,386) in 2016 per 100,000 patients. The estimated annual exposure to at least 2 drugs was above 7,200 per 100,000 patients in most years of the study, reaching an apex of 7,660 (CI: 7,632-7,687) per 100,000 patients in 2014. An estimated 4,748 per 100,000 prescribing events were potentially eligible for a genotype-guided intervention. Results from this study show that a significant portion of adults treated at medical institutions across the United States is exposed to medications for which genetic information, if available, should be used to guide prescribing.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the physical, social, and psychological initiation practices of street connected children and youths, in Eldoret, western Kenya.This qualitative study was conducted from August 2013 to February 2014. A total of 65 SCCY aged 11-24 years were purposively sampled from the three referral points: 1) A dedicated study clinic for vulnerable children and youth at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH); 2) Primary locations in which street children reside "bases/barracks"; 3) Street youth community-based organizations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data. All data were audio recorded, transcribed, translated to English, and a content analysis performed.The overall median age was 18 years (IQR 14-20.5 years) and 69.2% of participants were male. None had gone beyond primary level of education. The majority (81.5%) reported to be sexually active. The street community had well-defined structures and rules that were protective of members and ensured survival on the streets. To be fully accepted children had to go through an initiation ritual that had important gender differences. Common rituals between males and females included interrogation, smearing of black soot, and payment of tax. Ritual practices unique to boys were physical abuse, theft of personal possessions, volatile substance use, being forced to eat garbage, and sodomy among the physically weak. Rituals unique to girls were being forced to 'become a wife or sexual partner', rape, and gang rape. Physical and psychological abuse during initiation was normalized and there were no clear mechanisms of dealing with these forms of abuse.There were important gender differences in the initiation practices of SCCY. Normalization of physical and psychological abuse during initiation contributes to the high health risks faced by these SCCY. Appropriate interventions need to be developed in collaboration with SCCY.

AB  - Objectives To describe the perspectives of family caregivers toward stopping cancer screening tests for their relatives with dementia and identify opportunities to reduce harmful or unnecessary screening. Design Focus group study. Setting Alzheimer's Association support groups for family members of individuals with dementia. Participants Four focus groups including 32 caregivers (25 female; 24 white, 7 African American, one American/Indian; mean age 65.5, range 49–85). Measurements Focus group transcripts were transcribed and analyzed using methods of grounded theory. Results Caregivers considered decisions to stop cancer screening in terms of quality of life and burden on the patient and caregiver. Many described having to intervene in the patient's care to stop unnecessary or harmful screening, and others met resistance when they advocated for stopping. Physicians varied widely in their knowledge of dementia care and willingness to consider cessation of screening. Conclusion Many family caregivers wish to stop cancer screening tests as dementia progresses and are relieved when physicians bring it up. Caregivers are open to discussions of screening cessation that focus on quality of life, burdens, and benefits. Interventions are needed to increase caregiver and clinician discussion of screening cessation and to increase clinician awareness of the need to reconsider cancer screening in individuals with dementia.

AB  - Minnesota's Performance-Based Incentive Payment Program uses a collaborative, provider-initiated approach to nursing home quality improvement: up-front funding of evidence-based projects selected and designed by participating facilities, with accountable performance targets. During the first 4 rounds of funding (2007-10), 66 projects were launched at 174 facilities. Using a composite quality measure representing multiple dimensions of clinical care, we found that facilities participating during this period exhibited significantly greater gains than did nonparticipating facilities, in both targeted areas and overall quality, and maintained their quality advantage after project completion. Participating and nonparticipating facilities were similar at baseline with respect to quality scores and improvement trends, as well as acuity-adjusted payment, operating costs, and nurse staffing. Although self-selection precludes firm conclusions regarding the program's impacts, early findings indicate that the program shows promise for incentivizing nursing home quality improvement, both in facility-identified areas of concern and overall.

AB  - Objective: To describe HIV testing uptake and prevalence among adolescents and adults in a home-based HIV counseling and testing program in western Kenya. Methods: Since 2007, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program has implemented home-based HIV counseling and testing on a large scale. All individuals aged ≥13 years were eligible for testing. Data from 5 of 8 catchments were included in this analysis. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression to examine testing uptake and HIV prevalence among adolescents (13–18 years), younger adults (19–24 years), and older adults (≥25 years). Results: There were 154,463 individuals eligible for analyses as follows: 22% adolescents, 19% younger adults, and 59% older adults. Overall mean age was 32.8 years and 56% were female. HIV testing was high (96%) across the following 3 groups: 99% in adolescents, 98% in younger adults, and 94% in older adults (P < 0.001). HIV prevalence was higher (11.0%) among older adults compared with younger adults (4.8%) and adolescents (0.8%) (P < 0.001). Those who had ever previously tested for HIV were less likely to accept HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio: 0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.07) but more likely to newly test HIV positive (adjusted odds ratio: 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.21 to 1.40). Age group differences were evident in the sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors associated with testing uptake and HIV prevalence, particularly, gender, relationship status, and HIV testing history. Conclusions: Sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were independently associated with HIV testing and prevalence among the age groups. Community-based treatment and prevention strategies will need to consider these factors.

AB  - Unbefriended, incapacitated individuals who lack surrogates to make medical decisions present a complex problem to the healthcare providers who treat them. Adults without surrogates are among the most vulnerable in the community and are often alone and estranged from family, neglected and abused, and at risk of receiving inappropriate medical treatment. This article describes the program model and outcomes for the first 2 years of the Wishard Volunteer Advocates Program ( WVAP ), a guardianship program using trained, supervised volunteers as surrogates for unbefriended, incapacitated individuals. Of the 50 individuals enrolled during the study period, 20 were female, and 39 were Caucasian and 11 African American. Their average age was 67. Nineteen were insured with Medicare as primary and Medicaid as supplementary insurance. Ninety‐eight percent had four or more comorbid conditions at the time of the index hospitalization. Before program referral, many lived alone in unsafe conditions. Adult Protective Services was involved in almost half of the cases at the time of the index hospitalization. Approximately half of the participants required some type of property management. Healthcare usage data demonstrated that most were not receiving medical care before WVAP enrollment; the data indicated a decrease in emergency department visits and hospitalization after WVAP enrollment. The WVAP completed Medicaid applications for 12 participants, resulting in $297,481.62 in reimbursement for the index hospitalization and a payer source for subsequent hospitalization and long‐term care. The volunteer advocate model provides an efficient and quality mechanism for providing unbefriended individuals with surrogates.

AB  - BACKGROUND US healthcare underperforms on quality and safety metrics. Inpatient care constitutes an immense opportunity to intervene to improve care. OBJECTIVE Describe a model of inpatient care and measure its impact. DESIGN A quantitative assessment of the implementation of a new model of care. The graded implementation of the model allowed us to follow outcomes and measure their association with the dose of the implementation. SETTING AND PATIENTS Inpatient medical and surgical units in a large academic health center. INTERVENTION Eight interventions rooted in improving interprofessional collaboration (IPC), enabling data‐driven decisions, and providing leadership were implemented. MEASUREMENTS Outcome data from August 2012 to December 2013 were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models for associations with the implementation of the model. Length of stay (LOS) index, case‐mix index–adjusted variable direct costs (CMI‐adjusted VDC), 30‐day readmission rates, overall patient satisfaction scores, and provider satisfaction with the model were measured. RESULTS The implementation of the model was associated with decreases in LOS index ( P &lt; 0.0001) and CMI‐adjusted VDC ( P = 0.0006). We did not detect improvements in readmission rates or patient satisfaction scores. Most providers (95.8%, n = 92) agreed that the model had improved the quality and safety of the care delivered. CONCLUSIONS Creating an environment and framework in which IPC is fostered, performance data are transparently available, and leadership is provided may improve value on both medical and surgical units. These interventions appear to be well accepted by front‐line staff. Readmission rates and patient satisfaction remain challenging.

AB  - Biologic therapies have been used in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have been inadequately treated with conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Examine treatment patterns and health care costs among patients with PsAs who initiated biologic therapy either as monotherapy or adjunctively with traditional DMARDs.The MarketScan(®) database was used to identify adults with PsA who initiated therapy with a biologic (with first use identified as index date). Patients were required to have a 6-month pre-period with no biologic use and 1 year insurance eligibility pre- and post-index date. Cohorts of patients initiating biologic therapy either as monotherapy or adjunctively with traditional DMARDs were created. Medication use patterns including discontinuation, switching, and restarting were identified during the 1-year follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to compare time to discontinuation of index biologic, and logistic models were used to compare the rate of discontinuation and biologic switching between the 2 cohorts. All-cause and PsA-related costs were compared between the 2 cohorts using propensity score-adjusted bootstrapping methods. All comparisons were made after adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and PsA-related total cost over 1-year pre-index date.Among the 3164 PsA patients identified, 67.7% initiated biologics as monotherapy and 32.3% initiated biologics adjunctively with traditional DMARDs. The number of patients on pain medications, topical medications, and traditional DMARDs was significantly lower post index date compared to pre-index date (P < 0.01), while use of antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and statins increased after patients initiated biologic therapy. In 1-year post-period, approximately half of the patients (50.9%) who initiated a biologic continued their index biologic with an average time to discontinuation of 279.8 days for all patients. Rates of discontinuation, switching, and restart were 33.1%, 9.9%, and 6.1%, respectively, for all patients. Rates of switching and restart were similar between the 2 cohorts, but a significantly lower rate of discontinuation was observed in the biologic plus traditional DMARDs cohort than the biologic monotherapy cohort. Pharmacy expenditures were higher for the biologic + DMARD cohort than the biologic-monotherapy cohort ($14,486 vs $14,062; P = 0.0348). No statistically significant differences for either all-cause or PsA-specific costs were observed across the treatment cohorts.Traditional DMARDs used in combination with biologic therapy appear to reduce rates of biologic therapy discontinuation.

AB  - To describe the uptake of and factors associated with HIV prevalence among pregnant women in a large-scale home-based HIV counseling and testing (HBCT) program in western Kenya.In 2007, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Program (AMPATH) initiated HBCT to all individuals aged ≥13 years and high-risk children <13 years. Included in this analysis were females aged 13-50 years, from 6 catchment areas (11/08-01/12). We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to describe factors associated with HIV prevalence.There were 119,678 women eligible for analysis; median age 25 (interquartile range, IQR: 18-34) years. Of these, 7,396 (6.2%) were pregnant at the time of HBCT; 4,599 (62%) had ever previously tested for HIV and 2,995 (40.5%) had not yet attended ANC for their current pregnancy. Testing uptake among pregnant women was high (97%). HBCT newly identified 241 (3.3%) pregnant HIV-positive women and overall HIV prevalence among all pregnant women was 6.9%. HIV prevalence among those who had attended ANC in this pregnancy was 5.4% compared to 9.0% among those who had not. Pregnant women were more likely to newly test HIV-positive in HBCT if they had not attended ANC in the current pregnancy (AOR: 6.85, 95% CI: 4.49-10.44).Pregnant women who had never attended ANC were about 6 times more likely to newly test HIV-positive compared to those who had attended ANC, suggesting that the cascade of services for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission should optimally begin at the home and village level if elimination of perinatal HIV transmission is to be achieved.

AB  - Objective. Peer support is a novel and under-studied approach to the management of chronic pain. This study’s purpose was to uncover the elements of a peer-supported self-management intervention that are perceived by participants as essential to achieving positive changes. Design. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews. Methods. Veterans and veteran peer coaches who participated in a pilot study of peer support Improving Pain using Peer-Reinforced Self-Management Strategies (IMPPRESS, NCT01748227) took part in qualitative semi-structured interviews after completing the 4-month intervention. Questions were designed to facilitate understanding of how participants experienced the intervention. An immersion/crystallization approach was used to analyze data. Results. All 26 peer coaches and patients who completed the intervention were interviewed. Qualitative analysis revealed three elements of IMPPRESS that peer coaches and patients believed conferred benefit: 1) making interpersonal connections; 2) providing/receiving encouragement and support; and 3) facilitating the use of pain self-management strategies. Conclusions. Peer support represents a promising approach to chronic pain management that merits further study. The current study helps to identify intervention elements perceived by participants to be important in achieving positive results. Understanding how peer support may benefit patients is essential to optimize the effectiveness of peer support interventions and increase the implementation potential of peer-supported pain self-management into clinical practice.

We included white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), and Hispanic (any race) veterans, age ≥50 years, with an OA diagnosis from 2001-2011 (n = 539,841). Veterans were followed from their first OA diagnosis until September 30, 2013. As a proxy for increased clinical severity, analyses were also conducted for a subsample restricted to those who saw an orthopedic or rheumatology specialist (n = 148,844). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine racial and ethnic differences in total knee arthroplasty by year of OA diagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, physical and mental diagnoses, and pain intensity scores.We identified 12,087 total knee arthroplasty procedures in a sample of 473,170 white, 50,172 black, and 16,499 Hispanic veterans. In adjusted models examining black-white and Hispanic-white differences by year of OA diagnosis, total knee arthroplasty rates were lower for black than for white veterans diagnosed in all but 2 years. There were no Hispanic-white differences regardless of when diagnosis occurred. These patterns held in the specialty clinic subsample.Black-white differences in total knee arthroplasty appear to be persistent in the VA, even after controlling for potential clinical confounders.

AB  - An important domain of patient safety is the management of medications in home and community settings by patients and their caregiving network. This study applied human factors/ergonomics theories and methods to data about medication adherence collected from 61 patients with heart failure accompanied by 31 informal caregivers living in the US. Seventy non-adherence events were identified, described, and analysed for performance shaping factors. Half were classified as errors and half as violations. Performance shaping factors included elements of the person or team (e.g. patient limitations), task (e.g. complexity), tools and technologies (e.g. tool quality) and organisational, physical, and social context (e.g. resources, support, social influence). Study findings resulted in a dynamic systems model of medication safety applicable to patient medication adherence and the medication management process. Findings and the resulting model offer implications for future research on medication adherence, medication safety interventions, and resilience in home and community settings.Practitioner Summary: We describe situational and habitual errors and violations in medication use among older patients and their family members. Multiple factors pushed performance towards risk and harm. These factors can be the target for redesign or various forms of support, such as education, changes to the plan of care, and technology design.

AB  - Benzodiazepines and anticholinergics are risk factors for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). We tested the impact of a deprescribing intervention on short-term delirium outcomes.Multisite randomized clinical trial.ICUs of three large hospitals.Two hundred adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to an ICU with delirium, according to the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Participants had a contraindication to haloperidol (seizure disorder or prolonged QT interval) or preference against haloperidol as a treatment for delirium, and were excluded for serious mental illness, stroke, pregnancy, or alcohol withdrawal. Participants were randomized to a deprescribing intervention or usual care. The intervention included electronic alerts combined with pharmacist support to deprescribe anticholinergics and benzodiazepines.Primary outcomes were delirium duration measured by the CAM-ICU and severity measured by the Delirium Rating Scale Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) and the CAM-ICU-7; secondary outcomes included adverse events and mortality.Participants had a mean age of 61.8 (SD = 14.3) years, 59% were female, and 52% were African American, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. No differences between groups were identified in the number exposed to anticholinergics (P = .219) or benzodiazepines (P = .566), the median total anticholinergic score (P = .282), or the median total benzodiazepine dose in lorazepam equivalents (P = .501). Neither median delirium/coma-free days (P = .361) nor median change in delirium severity scores (P = .582 for DRS-R-98; P = .333 for CAM-ICU-7) were different between groups. No differences in adverse events or mortality were identified.When added to state-of-the-art clinical services, this deprescribing intervention had no impact on medication use in ICU participants. Given the age of the population, results of clinical outcomes may not be easily extrapolated to older adults. Nonetheless, improved approaches for deprescribing or preventing anticholinergics and benzodiazepines should be developed to determine the impact on delirium outcomes.

AB  - Personas can be used to understand patterns of variation in patients’ performance of cognitive work, particularly self-care decision making. In this study, we used a patient-centered cognitive task analysis (P-CTA) to develop self-care decision-making personas. We collected data from 24 older adults with chronic heart failure and 14 support persons, using critical incident and fictitious scenario interviews. Qualitative analyses produced three personas but revealed that individuals exemplify different personas across situations. The Rule-Following persona seeks clear rules, exercises caution under uncertainty, and grounds actions in confidence in clinician experts. The Researching persona seeks information to gain better understanding, invents strategies, and conducts experiments independently or with clinicians. The Disengaging persona does not actively seek rules or information and does not attempt to reduce uncertainty or conduct experiments. We discuss the situational nature of personas, their use in design, and the benefits of P-CTA for studying patient decision making.

AB  - In this study, we explored the relationship between changes in resident health outcomes, practitioner communication patterns, and practitioner perceptions of group effectiveness within a quality-improvement collaborative of nursing home clinicians. Survey and interview data were collected from nursing home clinicians participating in a quality-improvement collaborative. Quality-improvement outcomes were evaluated using US Federal and State minimum dataset measures. Models were specified evaluating the relationships between resident outcomes, staff perceptions of communication patterns, and staff perceptions of collaborative effectiveness. Interview data provided deeper understanding of the quantitative findings. Reductions in fall rates were highest in facilities where respondents experienced the highest levels of communication with collaborative members outside of scheduled meetings, and where respondents perceived that the collaborative kept them informed and provided new ideas. Clinicians observed that participation in a quality-improvement collaborative positively influenced the ability to share innovative ideas and expand the quality-improvement program within their nursing home. For practitioners, a high level of communication, both inside and outside of meetings, was key to making measurable gains in resident health outcomes.

AB  - Chronic pain in individuals with HIV is a common, impairing condition. Behavioral interventions for chronic pain specifically tailored to this population have yet to be developed. We assert that understanding self-management strategies already used by persons living with these conditions is an essential first step, and is the objective of this investigation.We conducted a thematic analysis of qualitative data from 25 in-depth interviews with individuals with HIV and chronic pain.The primary pain self-management strategies articulated by participants were: physical activity; cognitive and spiritual strategies; spending time with family and friends and social support; avoidance of physical/social activity; medication-centric pain management; and substance use.Some of these strategies may be viewed as beneficial and overlap with known HIV self-management strategies (cognitive strategies), whereas others may have negative health consequences (substance use). Interventions that incorporate healthy self-management strategies may be particularly effective in improving both HIV and pain outcomes.

AB  - While there is evidence that knowledge influences understanding of health information, less is known about the processing mechanisms underlying this effect and its impact on memory. We used the moving window paradigm to examine how older adults varying in domain-general crystallised ability (verbal ability) and health knowledge allocate attention to understand health and domain-general texts. Participants (n = 107, age: 60–88 years) read and recalled single sentences about hypertension and about non-health topics. Mixed-effects modelling of word-by-word reading times suggested that domain-general crystallised ability increased conceptual integration regardless of text domain, while health knowledge selectively increased resource allocation to conceptual integration at clause boundaries in health texts. These patterns of attentional allocation were related to subsequent recall performance. Although older adults with lower levels of crystallised ability were less likely to engage in integrative processing, when they did, this strategy had a compensatory effect in improving recall. These findings suggest that semantic integration during reading is an important comprehension process that supports the construction of the memory representation and is engendered by knowledge. Implications of the findings for theories of text processing and memory as well as for designing patient education materials are discussed.

AB  - Increasing cure rates for childhood cancers have resulted in a population of adult childhood cancer survivors (CCS) that are at risk for late effects of cancer-directed therapy. Our objective was to identify facilitators and barriers to primary care physicians (PCPs) providing late effects screening and evaluate information tools PCPs perceive as useful. We analyzed surveys from 351 practicing internal medicine and family practice physicians nationwide. A minority of PCPs perceived that their medical training was adequate to recognize late effects of chemotherapy (27.6%), cancer surgery (36.6%), and radiation therapy (38.1%). Most PCPs (93%) had never used Children's Oncology Group guidelines, but 86% would follow their recommendations. Most (84% to 86%) PCPs stated that they had never received a cancer treatment summary or survivorship care plan but (>90%) thought these documents would be useful. PCPs have a low level of awareness and receive inadequate training to recognize late effects. Overall, PCPs infrequently utilize guidelines, cancer treatment summaries, and survivorship care plans, although they perceive such tools as useful. We have identified gaps to address when providing care for CCS in routine general medical practice.

AB  - Follow-up with a primary care provider after hospital discharge has been associated with a reduced likelihood of readmission. However, primary care providers are frequently unaware of their patients' hospitalizations. Event notification may be an effective tool for reducing readmissions by notifying primary care providers when their patients have been admitted to and discharged from a hospital.We examined the effect of an event notification system on 30-day readmissions in the Bronx, New York. The Bronx has among the highest readmission rates in the country and is a particularly challenging setting to improve care due to the low socioeconomic status of the county and high rates of poor health behaviors among its residents. The study cohort included 2559 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries associated with 14 141 hospital admissions over the period January 2010 through June 2014. Linear regression models with beneficiary-level fixed-effects were used to estimate the impact of event notifications on readmissions by comparing the likelihood of rehospitalization for a beneficiary before and after event notifications were active.The unadjusted 30-day readmission rate when event notifications were not active was 29.5% compared to 26.5% when alerts were active. Regression estimates indicated that active hospitalization alert services were associated with a 2.9 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of readmission (95% confidence interval: -5.5, -0.4).Alerting providers through event notifications may be an effective tool for improving the quality and efficiency of care among high-risk populations.

AB  - On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake, followed by a tsunami and nuclear-reactor meltdowns, produced one of the most severe disasters in the history of Japan. The adverse impact of this 'triple disaster' on the health of local populations and the health system was substantial. In this study we examine population-level health indicator changes that accompanied the disaster, and discuss options for re-designing Fukushima's health system, and by extension that of Japan, to enhance its responsiveness and resilience to current and future shocks.We used country-level (Japan-average) or prefecture-level data (2005-2014) available from the portal site of Official Statistics of Japan for Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate, the prefectures that were most affected by the disaster, to compare trends before (2005-2010) and after (2011-2014) the 'disaster'. We made time-trend line plots to describe changes over time in age-adjusted cause-specific mortality rates in each prefecture.All three prefectures, and in particular Fukushima, had lower socio-economic indicators, an older population, lower productivity and gross domestic product per capita, and less higher-level industry than the Japan average. All three prefectures were 'medically underserved', with fewer physicians, nurses, ambulance calls and clinics per 100 000 residents than the Japan average. Even before the disaster, age-adjusted all-cause mortality in Fukushima was in general higher than the national rates. After the triple disaster we found that the mortality rate due to myocardial infarction increased substantially in Fukushima while it decreased nationwide. Compared to Japan average, spikes in mortality due to lung disease (all three prefectures), stroke (Iwate and Miyagi), and all-cause mortality (Miyagi and Fukushima) were also observed post-disaster. The cause-specific mortality rate from cancer followed similar trends in all three prefectures to those in Japan as a whole. Although we found a sharp rise in ambulance calls in Iwate and Miyagi, we did not see such a rise in Fukushima: a finding which may indicate limited responsiveness to acute demand because of pre-existing restricted capacity in emergency ambulance services.We analyze changes in indicators of health and health systems infrastructure in Fukushima before and five years following the disaster, and explored health systems' strengths and vulnerabilities. Spikes in mortality rates for selected non-infectious conditions common among older individuals were observed compared to the national trends. The results suggest that poorer reserves in the health care delivery system in Fukushima limited its capacity to effectively meet sudden unexpected increases in demand generated by the disaster.

AB  - Many older adults living with heart failure struggle to follow recommended self-management routines. To help older adults with heart failure more effectively and efficiently self-manage their disease, we developed Engage, a mobile health application promoting the performance, logging, and sharing of routine self-management behaviors. This paper reports on the usability evaluation of the Engage system with 15 older adults with heart failure and informal caregivers. In two phases, participants used Engage during a task-based usability test (n=5) and a scenario-based usability test (n=10). Usability and performance data were assessed through video-recorded observation and the administration of the system usability scale (SUS) and NASA Task Load Index (TLX). We found that task-based testing was useful in quickly identifying problems within our application, but scenario-based testing elicited more valuable feedback from older adults. A comparison of the different evaluation methods used and the discussion of the challenges encountered provide multiple implications for the practice of usability testing of mobile health products with older adults.

AB  - Older adults purchase and use over-the-counter (OTC) medications with potentially significant adverse effects. Some OTC medications, such as those with anticholinergic effects, are relatively contraindicated for use by older adults due to evidence of impaired cognition and other adverse effects. To inform the design of future OTC medication safety interventions for older adults, this study investigated consumers' decision making and behavior related to OTC medication purchasing and use, with a focus on OTC anticholinergic medications. The study had a cross-sectional design with multiple methods. A total of 84 adults participated in qualitative research interviews (n = 24), in-store shopper observations (n = 39), and laboratory-based simulated OTC shopping tasks (n = 21). Simulated shopping participants also rank-ordered eight factors on their importance for OTC decision making. Findings revealed that many participants had concerns about medication adverse effects, generally, but were not aware of age-related risk associated with the use of anticholinergic medications. Analyses produced a map of the workflow of OTC-related behavior and decision making as well as related barriers such as difficulty locating medications or comparing them to an alternative. Participants reported effectiveness, adverse effects or health risks, and price as most important to their OTC medication purchase and use decisions. A persona analysis identified two types of consumers: the habit follower, who frequently purchased OTC medications and considered them safe; and the deliberator, who was more likely to weigh their options and consider alternatives to OTC medications. A conceptual model of OTC medication purchase and use is presented. Drawing on study findings and behavioral theories, the model depicts dual processes for OTC medication decision making – habit-based and deliberation-based – as well as the antecedents and consequences of decision making. This model suggests several design directions for consumer-oriented interventions to promote OTC medication safety.

AB  - Health information technology is a core infrastructure for the chronic care model, integrated care, and other organized care delivery models. From the provider perspective, health information exchange (HIE) helps aggregate and share information about a patient or population from several sources. HIE technologies include direct messages, transfer of care, and event notification services. From the patient perspective, personal health records, secure messaging, text messages, and other mHealth applications may coordinate patients and providers. Patient-reported outcomes and social media technologies enable patients to share health information with many stakeholders, including providers, caregivers, and other patients. An information architecture that integrates personal health record and mHealth applications, with HIEs that combine the electronic health records of multiple healthcare systems will create a rich, dynamic ecosystem for patient collaboration.

AB  - Adults who have advanced cancer experience distress, and many use religion and spirituality to cope. Research on the spiritual experiences of patients with advanced cancer will help guide the provision of high-quality spiritual care.To qualitatively describe advanced cancer patients' spiritual experiences of illness.We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews at a single cancer center with 21 patients with stage IV solid malignancies who had a prognosis of less than 12 months, as estimated by each patient's medical oncologist. Five investigators conducted a thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews.We found 31 patients who were eligible for enrollment, and 21 (67.7%) participated in interviews to thematic saturation. Using a thematic-analysis approach, five major themes emerged. Relationships with family and friends was the most important theme among all 21 patients irrespective of their religious or spiritual identity. Relationship with God and faith community was frequently identified by those who considered themselves spiritually religious. Cancer often led to reflection about the meaning of life and the nature of existential suffering. Patients addressed the extent to which identity was changed or maintained through the cancer experience, and some expressed acceptance as a way of coping with illness.Spiritual care for dying cancer patients should always include the exploration of relationships with family and friends, as well as God and faith community for some patients. Relationships with family, friends, and God can be a source of strength for many. Making meaning, addressing identity concerns, supporting acceptance as a resource for coping with illness, and acknowledging existential suffering will often arise for these patients.

AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal pain is often accompanied by depression or anxiety wherein co-occurring pain and mood symptoms can be more difficult to treat than either alone. However, few clinical trials have examined interventions that simultaneously target both pain and mood conditions. To determine the comparative effectiveness of automated self-management (ASM) vs. ASM-enhanced collaborative care. Randomized clinical trial conducted in six primary care clinics in a VA medical center. Two hundred ninety-four patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain of at least moderate intensity and clinically significant depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. ASM consisted of automated monitoring and 9 web-based self-management modules. Comprehensive symptom management (CSM) combined ASM with collaborative care management by a nurse-physician team. Both interventions were delivered for 12 months. Primary outcome was a composite pain-anxiety-depression (PAD) z-score consisting of the mean of the BPI, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 z-scores: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 represent potentially small, moderate, and large clinical differences. Secondary outcomes included global improvement, health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and health services use. Both CSM and ASM groups had moderate PAD score improvement at 12 months (z = − 0.65 and − 0.52, respectively). Compared to the ASM group, the CSM group had a − 0.23 (95% CI, − 0.38 to − 0.08; overall P = .003) greater decline in composite PAD z-score over 12 months. CSM patients were also more likely to report global improvement and less likely to report worsening at 6 (P = .004) and 12 months (P = .013). Two intervention models relying heavily on telecare delivery but differing in resource intensity both produced moderate improvements in pain and mood symptoms. However, the model combining collaborative care led by a nurse-physician team with web-based self-management was superior to self-management alone. ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT0175730

AB  - With the remarkable success of digital histopathology, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of computational methods for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image patches. However, the unprecedented scale and heterogeneous patterns of histopathological images have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new computational histopathology tools. Recently, deep learning technology has been extremely successful in the field of computer vision, which has also boosted considerable interest in digital pathology applications. Deep learning and its extensions have opened several avenues to tackle many challenging histopathological image analysis problems including color normalization, image segmentation, and the diagnosis/prognosis of human cancers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive up-to-date review of the deep learning methods for digital H&E-stained pathology image analysis. Specifically, we first describe recent literature that uses deep learning for color normalization, which is one essential research direction for H&E-stained histopathological image analysis. Followed by the discussion of color normalization, we review applications of the deep learning method for various H&E-stained image analysis tasks such as nuclei and tissue segmentation. We also summarize several key clinical studies that use deep learning for the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers from H&E-stained histopathological images. Finally, online resources and open research problems on pathological image analysis are also provided in this review for the convenience of researchers who are interested in this exciting field.

AB  - Quality indicator collection and feedback improves stroke care. We sought to determine whether quality improvement training plus indicator feedback was more effective than indicator feedback alone in improving inpatient stroke indicators.We conducted a cluster-randomised quality improvement trial, randomising hospitals to quality improvement training plus indicator feedback versus indicator feedback alone to improve deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and dysphagia screening. Intervention sites received collaborative-based quality improvement training, external facilitation and indicator feedback. Control sites received only indicator feedback. We compared indicators pre-implementation (pre-I) to active implementation (active-I) and post-implementation (post-I) periods. We constructed mixed-effect logistic models of the two indicators with a random intercept for hospital effect, adjusting for patient, time, intervention and hospital variables.Patients at intervention sites (1147 admissions), had similar race, gender and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores to control sites (1017 admissions). DVT prophylaxis improved more in intervention sites during active-I period (ratio of ORs 4.90, p<0.001), but did not differ in post-I period. Dysphagia screening improved similarly in both groups during active-I, but control sites improved more in post-I period (ratio of ORs 0.67, p=0.04). In logistic models, the intervention was independently positively associated with DVT performance during active-I period, and negatively associated with dysphagia performance post-I period.Quality improvement training was associated with early DVT improvement, but the effect was not sustained over time and was not seen with dysphagia screening. External quality improvement programmes may quickly boost performance but their effect may vary by indicator and may not sustain over time.

AB  - In order to improve our understanding of the relationship between the built environment and physical activity, it is important to identify associations between specific geographic characteristics and physical activity behaviors.Examine relationships between observed physical activity behavior and measures of the built environment collected on 291 street segments in Indianapolis and St. Louis.Street segments were selected using a stratified geographic sampling design to ensure representation of neighborhoods with different land use and socioeconomic characteristics. Characteristics of the built environment on-street segments were audited using two methods: in-person field audits and audits based on interpretation of Google Street View imagery with each method blinded to results from the other. Segments were dichotomized as having a particular characteristic (e.g., sidewalk present or not) based on the two auditing methods separately. Counts of individuals engaged in different forms of physical activity on each segment were assessed using direct observation. Non-parametric statistics were used to compare counts of physically active individuals on each segment with built environment characteristic.Counts of individuals engaged in physical activity were significantly higher on segments with mixed land use or all non-residential land use, and on segments with pedestrian infrastructure (e.g., crosswalks and sidewalks) and public transit.Several micro-level built environment characteristics were associated with physical activity. These data provide support for theories that suggest changing the built environment and related policies may encourage more physical activity.

AB  - Use of hospice has been associated with improved outcomes for nursing home residents and attitudes of nursing home staff toward hospice influences hospice referral. The objective of this study is to describe attitudes of certified nursing assistants (CNAs), nurses, and social workers toward hospice care in nursing homes.We conducted a survey of 1859 staff from 52 Indiana nursing homes.Study data include responses to 6 scaled questions and 3 open-ended qualitative prompts. In addition, respondents who cared for a resident on hospice in the nursing home were asked how often hospice: (1) makes their job easier; (2) is responsive when a patient has symptoms or is actively dying; (3) makes care coordination smooth; (4) is needed; (5) taught them something; and (6) is appreciated by patients/families. Responses were dichotomized as always/often or sometimes/never.A total of 1229 surveys met criteria for inclusion. Of the respondents, 48% were CNAs, 49% were nurses, and 3% were social workers; 83% reported caring for a nursing home patient on hospice. The statement with the highest proportion of always/often rating was 'patient/family appreciate added care' (84%); the lowest was 'hospice makes my job easier' (54%). More social workers responded favorably regarding hospice responsiveness and coordination of care compared with CNAs (P = .03 and P = .05, respectively).A majority of staff responded favorably regarding hospice care in nursing homes. About one-third of nursing home staff rated coordination of care lower than other aspects, and many qualitative comments highlighted examples of when hospice was not responsive to patient needs, representing important opportunities for improvement.

AB  - Health literacy is associated with health outcomes presumably because it influences the understanding of information needed for self-care. However, little is known about the language comprehension mechanisms that underpin health literacy.We explored the relationship between a commonly used measure of health literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults [STOFHLA]) and comprehension of health information among 145 older adults.Results showed that performance on the STOFHLA was associated with recall of health information. Consistent with the Process-Knowledge Model of Health Literacy, mediation analysis showed that both processing capacity and knowledge mediated the association between health literacy and recall of health information. In addition, knowledge moderated the effects of processing capacity limits, such that processing capacity was less likely to be associated with recall for older adults with higher levels of knowledge.These findings suggest that knowledge contributes to health literacy and can compensate for deficits in processing capacity to support comprehension of health information among older adults. The implications of these findings for improving patient education materials for older adults with inadequate health literacy are discussed.

AB  - Background: An accurate physical fitness survey could be useful in research and clinical care. Purpose: To estimate the validity and reliability of a Self-Reported Fitness (SRFit) survey; an instrument that estimates muscular fitness, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, BMI, and body composition (BC) in adults ≥ 40 years of age. Methods: 201 participants completed the SF-36 Physical Function Subscale, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Older Adults’ Desire for Physical Competence Scale (Rejeski), the SRFit survey, and the Rikli and Jones Senior Fitness Test. BC, height and weight were measured. SRFit survey items described BC, BMI, and Senior Fitness Test movements. Correlations between the Senior Fitness Test and the SRFit survey assessed concurrent validity. Cronbach’s Alpha measured internal consistency within each SRFit domain. SRFit domain scores were compared with SF-36, IPAQ, and Rejeski survey scores to assess construct validity. Intraclass correlations evaluated test-retest reliability. Results: Correlations between SRFit and the Senior Fitness Test domains ranged from 0.35 to 0.79. Cronbach’s Alpha scores were .75 to .85. Correlations between SRFit and other survey scores were –0.23 to 0.72 and in the expected direction. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.79 to 0.93. All P -values were 0.001. Conclusion: Initial evaluation supports the SRFit survey’s validity and reliability.

AB  - Increased adoption of electronic health records has resulted in increased availability of free text clinical data for secondary use. A variety of approaches to obtain actionable information from unstructured free text data exist. These approaches are resource intensive, inherently complex and rely on structured clinical data and dictionary-based approaches. We sought to evaluate the potential to obtain actionable information from free text pathology reports using routinely available tools and approaches that do not depend on dictionary-based approaches.We obtained pathology reports from a large health information exchange and evaluated the capacity to detect cancer cases from these reports using 3 non-dictionary feature selection approaches, 4 feature subset sizes, and 5 clinical decision models: simple logistic regression, naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and J48 decision tree. The performance of each decision model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.Decision models parameterized using automated, informed, and manual feature selection approaches yielded similar results. Furthermore, non-dictionary classification approaches identified cancer cases present in free text reports with evaluation measures approaching and exceeding 80-90% for most metrics.Our methods are feasible and practical approaches for extracting substantial information value from free text medical data, and the results suggest that these methods can perform on par, if not better, than existing dictionary-based approaches. Given that public health agencies are often under-resourced and lack the technical capacity for more complex methodologies, these results represent potentially significant value to the public health field.

AB  - Objectives: Describe the development of a competent workforce committed to providing patient-centered care to persons with dementia and/or depression and their caregivers; to report on qualitative analyses of our workforce's case reports about their experiences; and to present lessons learned about developing and implementing a collaborative care community-based model using our new workforce that we call care coordinator assistants (CCAs).Method: Sixteen CCAs were recruited and trained in person-centered care, use of mobile office, electronic medical record system, community resources, and team member support. CCAs wrote case reports quarterly that were analyzed for patient-centered care themes.Results: Qualitative analysis of 73 cases using NVivo software identified six patient-centered care themes: (1) patient familiarity/understanding; (2) patient interest/engagement encouraged; (3) flexibility and continuity of care; (4) caregiver support/engagement; (5) effective utilization/integration of training; and (6) teamwork. Most frequently reported themes were patient familiarity – 91.8% of case reports included reference to patient familiarity, 67.1% included references to teamwork and 61.6% of case reports included the theme flexibility/continuity of care. CCAs made a mean number of 15.7 (SD = 15.6) visits, with most visits for coordination of care services, followed by home visits and phone visits to over 1200 patients in 12 months.Discussion: Person-centered care can be effectively implemented by well-trained CCAs in the community.

AB  - Background: There is no validated, discriminating, and easy-to-apply tool for estimating risk of colorectal neoplasia. We studied whether the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Risk Assessment Tool, which estimates future CRC risk, could estimate current risk for advanced colorectal neoplasia among average-risk persons. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved individuals age 50 to 80 years undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy. We measured medical and family history, lifestyle information, and physical measures and calculated each person’s future CRC risk using the NCI tool’s logistic regression equation. We related quintiles of future CRC risk to the current risk of advanced neoplasia (sessile serrated polyp or tubular adenoma ≥ 1 cm, a polyp with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia, or CRC). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: For 4457 (98.5%) with complete data (mean age = 57.2 years, SD = 6.6 years, 51.7% women), advanced neoplasia prevalence was 8.26%. Based on quintiles of five-year estimated absolute CRC risk, current risks of advanced neoplasia were 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3% to 3.3%), 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), 6.4% (95% CI = 4.9% to 8.2%), 10.0% (95% CI = 8.1% to 12.1%), and 17.6% (95% CI = 15.5% to 20.6%; P &amp;lt; .001). For quintiles of estimated 10-year CRC risk, corresponding current risks for advanced neoplasia were 2.2% (95% CI = 1.4% to 3.5%), 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), 6.5% (95% CI = 5.0% to 8.3%), 9.3% (95% CI = 7.5% to 11.4%), and 18.4% (95% CI = 15.9% to 21.1%; P &amp;lt; .001). Among persons with an estimated five-year CRC risk above the median, current risk for advanced neoplasia was 12.8%, compared with 3.7% among those below the median (relative risk = 3.4, 95 CI = 2.7 to 4.4). Conclusions: The NCI’s Risk Assessment Tool, which estimates future CRC risk, may be used to estimate current risk for advanced neoplasia, making it potentially useful for tailoring and improving CRC screening efficiency among average-risk persons.

AB  - Background and Aims Endoscopic suturing of fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FC-SEMSs) may prevent migration. The aim of this study was to compare rates of migration between sutured FC-SEMSs (S-FCSEMSs), unsecured FC-SEMSs, and partially covered SEMSs (PC-SEMSs) placed for benign esophageal leaks and strictures. Methods In a retrospective, single-center, cohort study, rates of migration for S-FCSEMSs, FC-SEMSs, and PC-SEMSs were assessed in patients with at least 1 month of follow-up or experiencing clinically significant stent migration (CSSM) any time after placement. CSSM was defined as proximal or distal displacement of the stent by ≥2 cm or passage into the stomach plus the recurrence of pre-SEMS symptoms or signs. A multivariable analysis was done to identify additional risk factors for stent migration. Results A total of 184 SEMSs were placed in 101 patients, including 32 S-FCSEMSs in 25 patients, 114 FC-SEMSs in 59 patients, and 38 PC-SEMSs in 30 patients. CSSM occurred with 56 of 184 stents (30.4%) in 36 of 101 patients (35.6%), including 3 of 32 (9.4%) S-FCSEMSs, 45 of 114 (39.5%) FC-SEMSs, and 8 of 38 (21.1%) PC-SEMSs (P = .005). Migration was less likely for S-FCSEMSs than for FC-SEMSs (9.4% vs 39.5%; P = .01) but not between S-FCSEMSs and PC-SEMSs (9.4% vs 21.1%; P = .07) or between FC-SEMSs and PC-SEMSs (39.5% vs 21.1%; P = .38). Previous stent migration (odds ratio [OR], 3.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.88-8.19; P = .01) and previous esophageal surgery (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16-0.67; P = .002) were associated with increased and decreased risk of CSSM, respectively. Conclusions Endoscopic suturing of FC-SEMSs for benign esophageal disease reduces CSSM compared with unsecured FC-SEMSs but not PC-SEMSs. Patients with previous stent migration may benefit from prophylactic suturing of FC-SEMSs. Endoscopic suturing of fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FC-SEMSs) may prevent migration.

AB  - The timely delivery of guideline-concordant care may reduce the risk of recurrent vascular events for patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke. Although many health care organizations measure stroke care quality, few evaluate performance for patients with TIA or minor stroke, and most include only a limited subset of guideline-recommended processes.To assess the quality of guideline-recommended TIA and minor stroke care across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system nationwide.This cohort study included 8201 patients with TIA or minor stroke cared for in any VHA emergency department (ED) or inpatient setting during federal fiscal year 2014 (October 1, 2013, through September 31, 2014). Patients with length of stay longer than 6 days, ventilator use, feeding tube use, coma, intensive care unit stay, inpatient rehabilitation stay before discharge, or receipt of thrombolysis were excluded. Outlier facilities for each process of care were identified by constructing 95% CIs around the facility pass rate and national pass rate sites when the 95% CIs did not overlap. Data analysis occurred from January 16, 2016, through June 30, 2017.Ten elements of care were assessed using validated electronic quality measures.In the 8201 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [11.4] years; 7877 [96.0%] male; 4856 [59.2%] white), performance varied across elements of care: brain imaging by day 2 (6720/7563 [88.9%]; 95% CI, 88.2%-89.6%), antithrombotic use by day 2 (6265/7477 [83.8%]; 95% CI, 83.0%-84.6%), hemoglobin A1c measurement by discharge or within the preceding 120 days (2859/3464 [82.5%]; 95% CI, 81.2%-83.8%), anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation by day 7 after discharge (1003/1222 [82.1%]; 95% CI, 80.0%-84.2%), deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis by day 2 (3253/4346 [74.9%]; 95% CI, 73.6%-76.2%), hypertension control by day 90 after discharge (4292/5979 [71.8%]; 95% CI, 70.7%-72.9%), neurology consultation by day 1 (5521/7823 [70.6%]; 95% CI, 69.6%-71.6%), electrocardiography by day 2 or within 1 day prior (5073/7570 [67.0%]; 95% CI, 65.9%-68.1%), carotid artery imaging by day 2 or within 6 months prior (4923/7685 [64.1%]; 95% CI, 63.0%-65.2%), and moderate- to high-potency statin prescription by day 7 after discharge (3329/7054 [47.2%]; 95% CI, 46.0%-48.4%). Performance varied substantially across facilities (eg, neurology consultation had a facility outlier rate of 53.0%). Performance was higher for admitted patients than for patients cared for only in EDs with the greatest disparity for carotid artery imaging (4478/5927 [75.6%] vs 445/1758 [25.3%]; P < .001).This national study of VHA system quality of care for patients with TIA or minor stroke identified opportunities to improve care quality, particularly for patients who were discharged from the ED. Health care systems should engage in ongoing TIA care performance assessment to complement existing stroke performance measurement.

AB  - Genotype-guided prescribing in pediatrics could prevent adverse drug reactions and improve therapeutic response. Clinical pharmacogenetic implementation guidelines are available for many medications commonly prescribed to children. Frequencies of medication prescription and actionable genotypes (genotypes where a prescribing change may be indicated) inform the potential value of pharmacogenetic implementation.To assess potential opportunities for genotype-guided prescribing in pediatric populations among multiple health systems by examining the prevalence of prescriptions for each drug with the highest level of evidence (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium level A) and estimating the prevalence of potential actionable prescribing decisions.This serial cross-sectional study of prescribing prevalences in 16 health systems included electronic health records data from pediatric inpatient and outpatient encounters from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017. The health systems included academic medical centers with free-standing children's hospitals and community hospitals that were part of an adult health care system. Participants included approximately 2.9 million patients younger than 21 years observed per year. Data were analyzed from June 5, 2018, to April 14, 2020.Prescription of 38 level A medications based on electronic health records.Annual prevalence of level A medication prescribing and estimated actionable exposures, calculated by combining estimated site-year prevalences across sites with each site weighted equally.Data from approximately 2.9 million pediatric patients (median age, 8 [interquartile range, 2-16] years; 50.7% female, 62.3% White) were analyzed for a typical calendar year. The annual prescribing prevalence of at least 1 level A drug ranged from 7987 to 10 629 per 100 000 patients with increasing trends from 2011 to 2014. The most prescribed level A drug was the antiemetic ondansetron (annual prevalence of exposure, 8107 [95% CI, 8077-8137] per 100 000 children). Among commonly prescribed opioids, annual prevalence per 100 000 patients was 295 (95% CI, 273-317) for tramadol, 571 (95% CI, 557-586) for codeine, and 2116 (95% CI, 2097-2135) for oxycodone. The antidepressants citalopram, escitalopram, and amitriptyline were also commonly prescribed (annual prevalence, approximately 250 per 100 000 patients for each). Estimated prevalences of actionable exposures were highest for oxycodone and ondansetron (>300 per 100 000 patients annually). CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 substrates were more frequently prescribed than medications influenced by other genes.These findings suggest that opportunities for pharmacogenetic implementation among pediatric patients in the US are abundant. As expected, the greatest opportunity exists with implementing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic guidance for commonly prescribed antiemetics, analgesics, and antidepressants.

AB  - Apathy is one of the most prevalent, stable and persistent neuropsychiatric symptom across the neurocognitive disorders spectrum. Recent advances in understanding of phenomenology, neurobiology and intervention trials highlight apathy as an important target for clinical intervention. We conducted a comprehensive review and critical evaluation of recent advances to determine the evidence-based suggestions for future trial designs. This review focused on 4 key areas: 1) pre-dementia states; 2) assessment; 3) mechanisms/biomarkers and 4) treatment/intervention efficacy. Considerable progress has been made in understanding apathy as a treatment target and appreciating pharmacological and non-pharmacological apathy treatment interventions. Areas requiring greater investigation include: diagnostic procedures, symptom measurement, understanding the biological mechanisms/biomarkers of apathy, and a well-formed approach to the development of treatment strategies. A better understanding of the subdomains and biological mechanisms of apathy will advance apathy as a treatment target for clinical trials.

AB  - Evidence describing the incidence of severe COVID-19 illness following vaccination and booster with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines is needed, particularly for high-risk populations.To describe the incidence of severe COVID-19 illness among a cohort that received vaccination plus a booster vaccine dose.Retrospective cohort study of adults receiving care at Veterans Health Administration facilities across the US who received a vaccination series plus 1 booster against SARS-CoV-2, conducted from July 1, 2021, to May 30, 2022. Patients were eligible if they had received a primary care visit in the prior 2 years and had documented receipt of all US Food and Drug Administration-authorized doses of the initial mRNA vaccine or viral vector vaccination series after December 11, 2020, and a subsequent documented booster dose between July 1, 2021, and April 29, 2022. The analytic cohort consisted of 1 610 719 participants.Receipt of any combination of mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) primary vaccination series and a booster dose.Outcomes were breakthrough COVID-19 (symptomatic infection), hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia and/or death, and hospitalization with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and/or death. A subgroup analysis of nonoverlapping populations included those aged 65 years or older, those with high-risk comorbid conditions, and those with immunocompromising conditions.Of 1 610 719 participants, 1 100 280 (68.4%) were aged 65 years or older and 132 243 (8.2%) were female; 1 133 785 (70.4%) had high-risk comorbid conditions, 155 995 (9.6%) had immunocompromising conditions, and 1 467 879 (91.1%) received the same type of mRNA vaccine (initial series and booster). Over 24 weeks, 125.0 (95% CI, 123.3-126.8) per 10 000 persons had breakthrough COVID-19, 8.9 (95% CI, 8.5-9.4) per 10 000 persons were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia or died, and 3.4 (95% CI, 3.1-3.7) per 10 000 persons were hospitalized with severe pneumonia or died. For high-risk populations, incidence of hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia or death was as follows: aged 65 years or older, 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.6) per 10 000 persons; high-risk comorbid conditions, 6.7 (95% CI, 6.2-7.2) per 10 000 persons; and immunocompromising conditions, 39.6 (95% CI, 36.6-42.9) per 10 000 persons. Subgroup analyses of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia or death by time after booster demonstrated similar incidence estimates among those aged 65 years or older and with high-risk comorbid conditions but not among those with immunocompromising conditions.In a US cohort of patients receiving care at Veterans Health Administration facilities during a period of Delta and Omicron variant predominance, there was a low incidence of hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia or death following vaccination and booster with any of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S vaccines.

AB  - Background: Early television (TV) viewing has been linked with maternal depression and has adverse health effects in children. However, it is not known how early TV viewing occurs. This study evaluated the prevalence at which parents report TV viewing for their children if asked in the first 2 years of life and whether TV viewing is associated with maternal depression symptoms. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, TV viewing was evaluated in children 0 to 2 years of age in 4 pediatric clinics in Indianapolis, IN, between January 2011 and April 2012. Families were screened for any parental report of depression symptoms (0–15 months) and for parental report of TV viewing (before 2 years of age) using a computerized clinical decision support system linked to the patient's electronic health record. Results: There were 3254 children in the study. By parent report, 50% of children view TV by 2 months of age, 75% by 4 months of age, and 90% by 2 years of age. Complete data for both TV viewing and maternal depression symptoms were available for 2397 (74%) of children. In regression models, the odds of parental report of TV viewing increased by 27% for each additional month of child's age (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25–1.30; p < .001). The odds of TV viewing increased by almost half with parental report of depression symptoms (OR, 1.47; CI, 1.07–2.00, p = .016). Publicly insured children had 3 times the odds of TV viewing compared to children with private insurance (OR, 3.00; CI, 1.60–5.63; p = .001). Black children had almost 4 times the odds (OR, 3.75; CI, 2.70–5.21; p < .001), and white children had one-and-a-half times the odds (OR, 1.55; CI, 1.04–2.30; p = .032) of TV viewing when compared to Latino children. Conclusions: By parental report, TV viewing occurs at a very young age in infancy, usually between 0 and 3 months and varies by insurance and race/ethnicity. Children whose parents report depression symptoms are especially at risk for early TV viewing. Like maternal depression, TV viewing poses added risks for reduced interpersonal interactions to stimulate infant development. This work suggests the need to develop early targeted developmental interventions. Children as young as 0 to 3 months are viewing TV on most days. In the study sample of 0 to 2 year olds, the odds of TV viewing increased by more than a quarter for each additional month of child's age and by as much as half when the mother screened positive for depression symptoms.

AB  - Objective Little is known about the association between mentorship and career choice during residency in pediatrics. This study examines graduating residents with mentors who provide career advice and the relationship between having a mentor who is a subspecialist and having a subspecialty practice goal. Methods National, random samples of 1000 graduating pediatrics residents were surveyed each year from 2006 to 2012; 4197 (61%) responded. Responses were pooled across years to examine mentor specialty and career goal at time of residency graduation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine relationships between mentor specialty and career goal at the time of graduation. Results Most (87%) residents reported having a mentor who provided career advice during residency; the proportion linearly increased from 83% in 2006 to 87% in 2012; P < .05. Forty-five percent of those with mentors had a mentor who was a subspecialist; 55% had a generalist as a mentor. Overall, 45% of residents had a subspecialty career goal at time of graduation. After controlling for career goal at the start of residency and resident characteristics, residents with a subspecialist mentor were more likely to have a subspecialty career goal at time of graduation (adjusted odds ratio = 5.25; 95% confidence interval, 4.41–6.25). Residents who were male, without children, without debt, not married, not minority, and from larger residency programs were also more likely to have a subspecialty career goal at the time of graduation from residency. Conclusions Almost 9 in 10 pediatric residents have a mentor who provides career advice. Although multiple factors shape decisions about careers, mentor specialty is one factor that might encourage residents to pursue fellowship training.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) is a technology that uses computer-based linguistics and artificial intelligence to identify and extract information from free-text data sources such as progress notes, procedure and pathology reports, and laboratory and radiologic test results. With the creation of large databases and the trajectory of health care reform, NLP holds the promise of enhancing the availability, quality, and utility of clinical information with the goal of improving documentation, quality, and efficiency of health care in the United States. To date, NLP has shown promise in automatically determining appropriate colonoscopy intervals and identifying cases of inflammatory bowel disease from electronic health records. The objectives of this review are to provide background on NLP and its associated terminology, to describe how NLP has been used thus far in the field of digestive diseases, and to identify its potential future uses.

AB  - <h3>Objective:</h3> To measure the extent and timing of physicians9 documentation of communication with patients and families regarding limitations on life-sustaining interventions, in a population cohort of adults who died within 30 days after hospitalization for ischemic stroke. <h3>Methods:</h3> We used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database to identify a retrospective cohort of adults with ischemic strokes at all California acute care hospitals from December 2006 to November 2007. Of 326 eligible hospitals, a representative sample of 39 was selected, stratified by stroke volume and mortality. Medical records of 981 admissions were abstracted, oversampled on mortality and tissue plasminogen activator receipt. Among 198 patients who died by 30 days postadmission, overall proportions and timing of documented preferences were calculated; factors associated with documentation were explored. <h3>Results:</h3> Of the 198 decedents, mean age was 80 years, 78% were admitted from home, 19% had mild strokes, 11% received tissue plasminogen activator, and 42% died during the index hospitalization. Preferences about at least one life-sustaining intervention were recorded on 39% of patients: cardiopulmonary resuscitation 34%, mechanical ventilation 23%, nasogastric tube feeding 10%, and percutaneous enteral feeding 6%. Most discussions occurred within 5 days of death. Greater stroke severity was associated with increased in-hospital documentation of preferences (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Documented discussions about limitations on life-sustaining interventions during hospitalization were low, even though this cohort died within 30 days poststroke. Improving the documentation of preferences may be difficult given the 2015 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 30-day stroke mortality hospital performance measure that is unadjusted for patient preferences regarding life-sustaining interventions.

AB  - Population-wide research on the impact of parent health literacy to children's health outcomes is limited. We assessed the relationship of low parent health literacy to a range of pediatric health risks within a large cohort of primary care patients.Data were from 17 845 English- and Spanish-speaking parents of children aged ≤7 years presenting for well-child care. We used a 3-item screener to measure health literacy. Outcomes included secondhand smoke exposure, asthma treatment nonadherence, parent depression, child-rearing practices, injury prevention, and parent first-aid knowledge. We summarized study variables with descriptive statistics and then performed multivariable logistic regression to identify associations between low parent literacy and our dependent measures.Mean child age was 4.8 years (SD 3.7); 36.5% of parent respondents had low health literacy. In models adjusted for child gender, race/ethnicity, insurance, age, and parent language preference, low parent health literacy was related to a range of pediatric health risks, including parent depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.48), firearm access (AOR 1.68; 1.49-1.89), not having a working smoke detector (AOR 3.54; 2.74-4.58), and lack of first-aid knowledge about choking (AOR 1.67; 1.44-1.93) and burns (AOR 1.45; 1.29-1.63). Children of parents with low health literacy were also more likely to watch >2 hours of television per day (AOR 1.27; 1.17-1.36).Low parent health literacy is independently and significantly related to parent depression, child television viewing, and at-risk family behaviors associated with child injury. Use of low-literacy approaches to health-behavior interventions may be essential to address common child morbidities.

AB  - This study explored the relationship between race and two key aspects of patient engagement—patient activation and working alliance—among a sample of African-American and White veterans (N = 152) seeking medication management for mental health conditions. After adjusting for demographics, race was significantly associated with patient activation, working alliance, and medication adherence scores. Patient activation was also associated with working alliance. These results provide support for the consideration of race and ethnicity in facilitating patient engagement and patient activation in mental healthcare. Minority patients may benefit from targeted efforts to improve their active engagement in mental healthcare.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect over 5 million Americans. Over a typical disease course of 5-10 years, family caregivers provide the majority of the day-to-day hands-on on care for persons with dementia. Most caregivers enter this complex role with little training and inadequate household resources and they are tasked to navigate a fragmented health care system as well as a patchwork of community services. Our nation can and should do more to help family caregivers provide care in the home to their loved ones who suffer from dementia. We will all benefit if we design and implement a better system of care for persons with dementia. We will benefit financially as a nation, we will benefit morally as a community, and in case we have forgotten, we stand to benefit ourselves as we age and face our own aging brain. Building a system of care requires excellent science and engineering, but we also need creative approaches that design systems of care that are available nationwide because they are scalable and affordable. Most importantly, families need our help now. We need to move faster.

AB  - Delirium is a highly prevalent and morbid syndrome in intensive care units (ICUs). Changing the stressful environment within the ICU via music may be an effective and a scalable way to reduce the burden of delirium.The Decreasing Delirium through Music (DDM) study is a three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled feasibility trial. Sixty patients admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation will be randomized to one of three arms (20 participants per arm): (1) personalized music, (2) non-personalized relaxing music, or (3) attention-control. Music preferences will be obtained from all enrolled participants or their family caregivers. Participants will receive two 1-h audio sessions a day through noise-cancelling headphones and mp3 players. Our primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the trial design (recruitment, adherence, participant retention, design and delivery of the music intervention). Our secondary aim is to estimate the potential effect size of patient-preferred music listening in reducing delirium, as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Participants will receive twice daily assessments for level of sedation and presence of delirium. Enrolled participants will be followed in the hospital until death, discharge, or up to 28 days, and seen in the Critical Care Recovery Clinic at 90 days.DDM is a feasibility trial to provide personalized and non-personalized music interventions for critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Our trial will also estimate the preliminary efficacy of music interventions on reducing delirium incidence and severity.ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03095443 . Registered on 23 March 2017.

AB  - Chronic pain is an important and understudied comorbidity in people living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted a pilot trial of Skills TO Manage Pain (STOMP), an innovative social cognitive theory-based pain self-management intervention tailored to PLWH, to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Eligibility criteria included being HIV+, ≥ moderate pain for ≥ 3 months and a score of ≥ 4 on the three-item PEG pain severity and interference scale. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to STOMP or a usual care comparison. Among 22 participants randomized to STOMP, median session attendance was 9/12 (75%). Of 19 STOMP participants surveyed, 13 reported being "much better" overall since beginning treatment. Brief pain inventory-total scores decreased by 2 points in the intervention group and 0.9 in the control group (p = 0.11). STOMP is feasible, acceptable, and shows preliminary evidence of efficacy and promise for a full-scale trial.

AB  - Persons living with dementia have complex care needs including memory loss that should be taken into account by providers and family caregivers involved with their care. The prevalence of comorbid conditions in people with dementia is high and, thus, how primary care, community providers and family caregivers provide best practice care, person-centered care is important.Care providers should understand the ongoing medical management needs of persons living with dementia in order to maximize their quality of life, proactively plan for their anticipated needs, and be as well prepared as possible for health crises that may occur.This article provides eight practice recommendations intended to promote understanding and support of the role of nonphysician care providers in educating family caregivers about ongoing medical management to improve the wellbeing of persons living with dementia.Key among these are recommendations to use nonpharmacological interventions to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as the first line of treatment and recommendations on how to best support the use and discontinuation of pharmacological interventions as necessary.

AB  - Fast-spiking (FS) neurons can fire action potentials (APs) up to 1,000 Hz and play key roles in vital functions such as sound location, motor coordination, and cognition. Here we report that the concerted actions of Kv3 voltage-gated K+ (Kv) and Na+ (Nav) channels are sufficient and necessary for inducing and maintaining FS. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed a robust correlation between the Kv3/Nav current ratio and FS. Expressing Kv3 channels alone could convert ∼30%–60% slow-spiking (SS) neurons to FS in culture. In contrast, co-expression of either Nav1.2 or Nav1.6 together with Kv3.1 or Kv3.3, but not alone or with Kv1.2, converted SS to FS with 100% efficiency. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing-based genome-wide analysis revealed that the Kv3/Nav ratio and Kv3 expression levels strongly correlated with the maximal AP frequencies. Therefore, FS is established by the properly balanced activities of Kv3 and Nav channels and could be further fine-tuned by channel biophysical features and localization patterns.

AB  - Abstract Healthcare information technologies are now a routine component of patient–clinician interactions. Originally designed for operational functions including billing and regulatory compliance, these systems have had unintended consequences including increased exam room documentation, divided attention during the visit, and use of scribes to alleviate documentation burdens. In an age in which technology is ubiquitous in everyday life, we must re-envision healthcare technology to support both clinical operations and, above all, the patient–clinician relationship. We present 6 habits for designing user-centered health technologies: (1) put patient care first, (2) assemble a team with the right skills, (3) relentlessly ask WHY, (4) keep it simple, (5) be Darwinian, and (6) don’t lose the forest for the trees. These habits should open dialogues between developers, implementers, end users, and stakeholders, as well as outline a path for better, more usable technology that puts patients and their clinicians back at the center of care.

AB  - Tumors are heterogeneous tissues with different types of cells such as cancer cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. Although the morphological features of tumors are critical for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the underlying molecular events and genes for tumor morphology are far from being clear. With the advancement in computational pathology and accumulation of large amount of cancer samples with matched molecular and histopathology data, researchers can carry out integrative analysis to investigate this issue. In this study, we systematically examine the relationships between morphological features and various molecular data in breast cancers. Specifically, we identified 73 breast cancer patients from the TCGA and CPTAC projects matched whole slide images, RNA-seq, and proteomic data. By calculating 100 different morphological features and correlating them with the transcriptomic and proteomic data, we inferred four major biological processes associated with various interpretable morphological features. These processes include metabolism, cell cycle, immune response, and extracellular matrix development, which are all hallmarks of cancers and the associated morphological features are related to area, density, and shapes of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. In addition, protein specific biological processes were inferred solely from proteomic data, suggesting the importance of proteomic data in obtaining a holistic understanding of the molecular basis for tumor tissue morphology. Furthermore, survival analysis yielded specific morphological features related to patient prognosis, which have a strong association with important molecular events based on our analysis. Overall, our study demonstrated the power for integrating multiple types of biological data for cancer samples in generating new hypothesis as well as identifying potential biomarkers predicting patient outcome. Future work includes causal analysis to identify key regulators for cancer tissue development and validating the findings using more independent data sets.

AB  - Abstract Prior research on health information exchange (HIE) typically measured provider usage through surveys or they summarized the availability of HIE services in a healthcare organization. Few studies utilized user log files. Using HIE access log files, we measured HIE use in real-world clinical settings over a 7-year period (2011-2017). Use of HIE increased in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED) settings. Further, while extant literature has generally viewed the ED as the most relevant setting for HIE, the greatest change in HIE use was observed in the inpatient setting, followed by the ED setting and then the outpatient setting. Our findings suggest that in addition to federal incentives, the implementation of features that address barriers to access (eg, Single Sign On), as well as value-added services (eg, interoperability with external data sources), may be related to the growth in user-initiated HIE.

AB  - Despite broad electronic health record (EHR) adoption in U.S. hospitals, there is concern that an "advanced use" digital divide exists between critical access hospitals (CAHs) and non-CAHs. We measured EHR adoption and advanced use over time to analyzed changes in the divide.We used 2008 to 2018 American Hospital Association Information Technology survey data to update national EHR adoption statistics. We stratified EHR adoption by CAH status and measured advanced use for both patient engagement (PE) and clinical data analytics (CDA) domains. We used a linear probability regression for each domain with year-CAH interactions to measure temporal changes in the relationship between CAH status and advanced use.In 2018, 98.3% of hospitals had adopted EHRs; there were no differences by CAH status. A total of 58.7% and 55.6% of hospitals adopted advanced PE and CDA functions, respectively. In both domains, CAHs were less likely to be advanced users: 46.6% demonstrated advanced use for PE and 32.0% for CDA. Since 2015, the advanced use divide has persisted for PE and widened for CDA.EHR adoption among hospitals is essentially ubiquitous; however, CAHs still lag behind in advanced use functions critical to improving care quality. This may be rooted in different advanced use needs among CAH patients and lack of access to technical expertise.The advanced use divide prevents CAH patients from benefitting from a fully digitized healthcare system. To close the widening gap in CDA, policymakers should consider partnering with vendors to develop implementation guides and standards for functions like dashboards and high-risk patient identification algorithms to better support CAH adoption.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is more common in women than in men; data characterizing sex differences in the management and outcomes of HFpEF patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are limited.Using Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry Emergency Module data linked to Medicare claims, we conducted a retrospective analysis of acute HF patients in the ED, identifying HFpEF (ejection fraction [EF] ≥40%) patients and stratifying by sex to compare baseline characteristics, ED therapies, hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and post-discharge outcomes. Of 4161 HFpEF patients, 2808 (67%) were women, who were more likely to be older and hypertensive, but less likely to be diabetic or smokers (all P < .01). Women more often presented with systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg (62.5% vs 56.4%; P = .0001) and higher EF. There were no sex differences in ED therapies, adjusted 30- and 180-day all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, or 30- and 180-day readmissions. After adjustment, women had longer LOS (0.40 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.70; P = .008).Women with HFpEF presenting to the ED were more likely to have elevated systolic blood pressure, but overall ED management strategies were similar to those in men. We observed adjusted differences in hospital LOS, but no differences in 30- and 180-day outcomes.

AB  - There is now widespread recognition of the powerful potential of electronic health record (EHR) systems to improve the health-care delivery system. The benefits of EHRs grow even larger when the health data within their purview are seamlessly shared, aggregated and processed across different providers, settings and institutions. Yet, the plethora of idiosyncratic conventions for identifying the same clinical content in different information systems is a fundamental barrier to fully leveraging the potential of EHRs. Only by adopting vocabulary standards that provide the lingua franca across these local dialects can computers efficiently move, aggregate and use health data for decision support, outcomes management, quality reporting, research and many other purposes. In this regard, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) is an important standard for physiotherapists because it provides a framework and standard language for describing health and health-related states. However, physiotherapists and other health-care professionals capture a wide range of data such as patient histories, clinical findings, tests and measurements, procedures, and so on, for which other vocabulary standards such as Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine Clinical Terms are crucial for interoperable communication between different electronic systems. In this paper, we describe how the ICF and other internationally accepted vocabulary standards could advance physiotherapy practise and research by enabling data sharing and reuse by EHRs. We highlight how these different vocabulary standards fit together within a comprehensive record system, and how EHRs can make use of them, with a particular focus on enhancing decision-making. By incorporating the ICF and other internationally accepted vocabulary standards into our clinical information systems, physiotherapists will be able to leverage the potent capabilities of EHRs and contribute our unique clinical perspective to other health-care providers within the emerging electronic health information infrastructure.

AB  - Hope (goal-directed thinking) and patient activation (knowledge and skills to manage one’s illness) are both important in managing chronic conditions like schizophrenia. The relationship between hope and patient activation has not been clearly defined. However, hope may be viewed as a foundational, motivating factor that can lead to greater involvement in care and feelings of efficacy. The purpose of the present study was to understand the prospective relationship between hope and patient activation in a sample of adults with schizophrenia (N=118). This study was a secondary data analysis from a study on Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) – a curriculum-based approach to schizophrenia self-management. Data were collected at baseline (prior to any intervention), and at 9 and 18-month follow-up. As predicted, hope and patient activation were significantly related with each other, showing large positive concurrent correlations. Demographics and background characteristics were not significantly related to patient activation or hope. Longitudinal analyses found no specific directional effect, yet suggested that hope and patient activation mutually influence each other over time. Our findings add flexibility in designing recovery-based interventions – fostering hope may not be a pre-requisite for activating consumers to be more involved in their own care.

AB  - The current study investigated clinicians' treatment preferences for chronic pain and depression and the extent to which these preferences were related to clinicians' experience and attitudes.Eighty-five participants (50 physicians, 35 medical students) made treatment recommendations for 8 virtual patients with chronic low back pain and depression. The 10 treatment options included pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Participants also provided information about their clinical experience and completed measures assessing their attitudes toward patients with pain and depression.The highest recommended treatments were over-the-counter medications and topical modalities, whereas "no intervention," referral to a pain specialist, and opioid medication received the lowest ratings. Physicians gave higher ratings to physical therapy (P<0.05) and lifestyle activities (P<0.05) than did medical students. Students reported more negative attitudes about patients with depression (P<0.05) than did physicians. After controlling for participants' attitudes, the treatment preference×training level interaction was no longer significant (P>0.05).Physicians and medical students shared a general preference for "low-risk," self-management approaches for chronic pain and depression; however, they differed in their recommendations for some specific treatments. Participants' attitudes toward patients with pain and depression were associated with their preferences and accounted for the differences in their treatment decisions. These results suggest a need for early and continuing education to reduce clinicians' negative attitudes toward and improve the management of patients with chronic pain and depression.

AB  - Prescribers and patients need a proper surveillance system for cognitive side effects 

A growing number of observational studies have shown the critical role of potentially inappropriate medications for increasing the risk of cognitive impairment. In a linked paper, Billioti de Gage and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj.g5205) extend the pharmacoepidemiological research on the adverse cognitive effects of benzodiazepines with an investigation of their link with Alzheimer’s disease.1 Their results suggest that long term exposure to benzodiazepines might be a modifiable risk factor for this condition.

The authors conducted a nested case-control study of about 2000 older members of a public drug plan in the province of Quebec, Canada. They observed a cumulative dose-effect association between exposure to benzodiazepines (at least 90 days) and risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and found that exposure lasting more than 180 days was associated with a nearly twofold increase in risk. In further analyses, they showed that longer acting benzodiazepines were associated with greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease compared with shorter acting benzodiazepines, adding support for a causal association.

AB  - We have proposed needed information management capabilities for future US health departments predicated on trends in health care reform and health information technology. Regardless of whether health departments provide direct clinical services (and many will), they will manage unprecedented quantities of sensitive information for the public health core functions of assurance and assessment, including population-level health surveillance and metrics. Absent improved capabilities, health departments risk vestigial status, with consequences for vulnerable populations. Developments in electronic health records, interoperability and information exchange, public information sharing, decision support, and cloud technologies can support information management if health departments have appropriate capabilities. The need for national engagement in and consensus on these capabilities and their importance to health department sustainability make them appropriate for consideration in the context of accreditation.

AB  - Objective Over 8 years, we have developed an innovative computer decision support system that improves appropriate delivery of pediatric screening and care. This system employs a guidelines evaluation engine using data from the electronic health record (EHR) and input from patients and caregivers. Because guideline recommendations typically exceed the scope of one visit, the engine uses a static prioritization scheme to select recommendations. Here we extend an earlier idea to create patient-tailored prioritization. Materials and methods We used Bayesian structure learning to build networks of association among previously collected data from our decision support system. Using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of discriminability (a sine qua non for expected value calculations needed for prioritization), we performed a structural analysis of variables with high AUC on a test set. Our source data included 177 variables for 29 402 patients. Results The method produced a network model containing 78 screening questions and anticipatory guidance (107 variables total). Average AUC was 0.65, which is sufficient for prioritization depending on factors such as population prevalence. Structure analysis of seven highly predictive variables reveals both face-validity (related nodes are connected) and non-intuitive relationships. Discussion We demonstrate the ability of a Bayesian structure learning method to ‘phenotype the population’ seen in our primary care pediatric clinics. The resulting network can be used to produce patient-tailored posterior probabilities that can be used to prioritize content based on the patient's current circumstances. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of EHR-driven population phenotyping for patient-tailored prioritization of pediatric preventive care services.

AB  - Abstract Recent investigations into appointment scheduling within facilities operated by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) illuminate systemic challenges in meeting its goal of providing timely access to care for all Veterans. In the wake of these investigations, new policies have been enacted to expand access to care at VA facilities as well as non-VA facilities if the VA is unable to provide access within a reasonable timeframe or a Veteran lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility. These policies are similar to broader health reform efforts that seek to expand access to care for other vulnerable populations. In this perspective, we discuss the informatics implications of expanded access within the VA and its wider applicability across the US health system. Health systems will require robust health information exchange, to maintain coordination while access to care is expanded. Existing informatics research can guide short-term implementation; furthermore, new research is needed to generate evidence about how best to achieve the long-term aim of expanded access to care.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate educational differences in treatment responses to memory, reasoning, and speed of processing cognitive training relative to no-contact control.Secondary analyses of the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly trial were conducted. Two thousand eight hundred older adults were randomized to memory, reasoning, or speed of processing training or no-contact control. A repeated-measures mixed-effects model was used to investigate immediate post-training and 1-year outcomes with sensitivity analyses out to 10 years. Outcomes were as follows: (1) memory composite of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test; (2) reasoning composite of letter series, letter sets, and word series; and (3) speed of processing measured using three trials of useful field of view and the digit symbol substitution test.The effects of reasoning and memory training did not differ by educational attainment. The effect of speed of processing training did. Those with fewer than 12 years of education experienced a 50% greater effect on the useful field of view test compared with those with 16 or more years of education. The training advantage for those with fewer than 12 years of education was maintained to 3 years post-training.Older adults with less than a secondary education are at elevated risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The analyses here indicate that speed of processing training is effective in older adults with low educational attainment.

AB  - Background:From 1992 to 2008, older adults in the United States incurred more healthcare expense per capita than any other age group. Home telemonitoring has emerged as a potential solution to reduce these costs, but evidence is mixed. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate whether the mean difference in total direct medical cost consequence between older adults receiving additional home telemonitoring care (TELE) (n=102) and those receiving usual medical care (UC) (n=103) were significant. Inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, decedents, survivors, and 30-day readmission costs were evaluated as secondary aim.Materials and Methods:Multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs) and parametric bootstrapping method were used to model cost and to determine significance of the cost differences. We also compared the differences in arithmetic mean costs.Results:From the conditional GLMs, the estimated mean cost differences (TELE versus UC) for total, inpatient, outpatient, and ED were −$9,537 (p=0.068), −$8,482 (p =0.098), −$1,160 (p=0.177), and $106 (p=0.619), respectively. Mean postenrollment cost was 11% lower than the prior year for TELE versus 22% higher for UC. The ratio of mean cost for decedents to survivors was 2.1:1 (TELE) versus 12.7:1 (UC).Conclusions:There were no significant differences in the mean total cost between the two treatment groups. The TELE group had less variability in cost of care, lower decedents to survivors cost ratio, and lower total 30-day readmission cost than the UC group.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined symptom‐based subgroups of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and the extent to which they differed across key constructs of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Methods Eighty women with MBC completed self‐report surveys assessing 10 common symptoms and several ACT variables (ie, activity engagement, psychological inflexibility, value obstruction, and value progress) during a single time point. Results A cluster analysis yielded 3 patient subgroups: low symptoms, low‐moderate symptoms, and moderate‐high symptoms. Relative to the subgroup with low symptoms, the other subgroups reported less activity engagement. In addition, compared with patients with low symptoms, the subgroup with moderate‐high symptoms reported greater psychological inflexibility (ie, avoidance of unwanted internal experiences) and greater difficulty living consistently with their values. Conclusions Women with MBC show heterogeneity in their symptom profiles, and those with higher symptom burden are more likely to disengage from valued activities and avoid unwanted experiences (eg, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations). Findings are largely consistent with the ACT model and provide strong justification for testing ACT to address symptom interference in MBC patients.

AB  - The burden on health systems due to increased volume of patients with HIV continues to rapidly increase. The goal of this study was to examine the experiences of HIV care providers in a high patient volume HIV treatment and care program in eastern Africa. Sixty care providers within the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program in western Kenya were recruited into this qualitative study. We conducted in-depth interviews focused on providers' perspectives on health system factors that impact patient engagement in HIV care. Results from thematic analysis demonstrated that providers perceive a work environment that constrained their ability to deliver high-quality HIV care and encouraged negative patient-provider relationships. Providers described their roles as high strain, low control, and low support. Health system strengthening must include efforts to improve the working environment and easing burden of care providers tasked with delivering antiretroviral therapy to increasing numbers of patients in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - In response to widespread concerns regarding Veterans’ access to VA care, Congress enacted the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, which required VA to establish the Veterans Choice Program (VCP). Since the inception of VCP, more than two million Veterans have received care from community providers, representing approximately 25% of Veterans enrolled in VA care. However, expanded access to non-VA care has created challenges in care coordination between VA and community health systems. In March 2018, the VA Health Services Research & Development Service hosted a VA State of the Art conference (SOTA) focused on care coordination. The SOTA convened VA researchers, program directors, clinicians, and policy makers to identify knowledge gaps regarding care coordination within the VA and between VA and community systems of care. This article provides a summary and synthesis of relevant literature and provides recommendations generated from the SOTA about how to evaluate cross-system care coordination. Care coordination is typically evaluated using health outcomes including hospital readmissions and death; however, in cross-system evaluations of care coordination, measures such as access, cost, Veteran/patient and provider satisfaction (including with cross-system communication), comparable quality metrics, context (urban vs. rural), and patient complexity (medical and mental health conditions) need to be included to fully evaluate care coordination effectiveness. Future research should examine the role of multiple individuals coordinating VA and non-VA care, and how these coordinators work together to optimize coordination.

AB  - Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely-advocated practice that has been linked to improved patient adherence, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. SDM is a process in which patients and providers share information, express opinions, and build consensus toward a treatment decision. Chronic pain and its treatment present unique challenges for SDM, especially in the current environment in which opioids are viewed as harmful and a national opioid crisis has been declared. The purpose of this qualitative study is to understand treatment decision-making with patients taking opioids for chronic pain. Ninety-five clinic visits and 31 interviews with patients and primary care providers (PCPs) were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results revealed that 1) PCPs desire patient participation in treatment decisions, but with caveats where opioids are concerned; 2) Disagreements about opioids, including perceptions of lack of listening, presented challenges to SDM; and 3) PCPs described engaging in persuasion or negotiation to convince patients to try alternatives to opioids, or appeasing patients requesting opioids with very small amounts in an effort to maintain the patient-provider relationship. Results are discussed through the lens of Charles, Gafni, and Whelan’s SDM model, and implications of the role of the patient-provider relationship in SDM and chronic pain treatment are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background Cannabis is increasingly available and used for medical and recreational purposes, but few studies have assessed provider knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding cannabis. Methods We administered a 47-item electronic survey to assess nationwide Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinician knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and practice regarding patients’ use of cannabis. Results We received 249 completed surveys from 39 states and the District of Columbia. Fifty-five percent of respondents were female, 74% were white, and the mean age was 50 years. There were knowledge gaps among a substantial minority of respondents in specific areas: terminology, psychoactive effects of cannabis components, VHA policy, and evidence regarding benefits and harms of cannabis. Most respondents were likely or very likely to plan to taper opioids if urine drug testing was positive for tetra-hydro cannabinol (THC; 73%). A significantly greater proportion of respondents from states in which cannabis is illegal for any purpose (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0–10.8) or is recreationally illegal (OR = 5.0, 95% CI = 2.4–10.8) reported being likely or very likely to taper opioids as compared with respondents from states in which cannabis is legal for medical and recreational purposes. Conclusions Among the sample, we found knowledge gaps, areas of discomfort discussing key aspects of cannabis use with their patients, and variation in practice regarding opioids in patients also using THC. These results suggest a need for more widespread clinician education about cannabis, as well as an opportunity to develop more robust guidance and evidence regarding management of patients using prescription opioids and cannabis concomitantly.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives To identify the implementation barriers, facilitators, and conditions associated with successful outcomes from a clinical demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long-stay nursing facility residents in 19 Indiana nursing homes. Research Design and Methods Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical quality, Improving Symptoms—Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) is a multicomponent intervention that includes enhanced geriatric care, transition support, and palliative care. The configurational analysis was used to analyze descriptive and quantitative data collected during the project. The primary outcome was reductions in hospitalizations per 1,000 eligible resident days. Results Analysis of barriers, facilitators, and conditions for success yielded a model with 2 solution pathways associated with a 10% reduction in potentially avoidable hospitalizations per 1,000 resident days: (a) lower baseline hospitalization rates and investment of senior management; or (b) turnover by the director of nursing during the observation period. Conditions for success were similar for a 20% reduction, with the addition of increased resident acuity. Discussion and Implications Key conditions for successful implementation of the OPTIMISTIC intervention include strong investment by senior leadership and an environment in which baseline hospitalization rates leave ample room for improvement. Turnover in the position of director of nursing also linked to successful implementation; this switch in leadership may represent an opportunity for culture change by bringing in new perspectives and viewpoints. These findings help define the conditions for the successful implementation of the OPTIMISTIC model and have implications for the successful implementation of interventions in the nursing facility more generally.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to determine the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in improving fatigue-related outcomes in adult cancer survivors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases and reference lists of included studies. Separate random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for fatigue and vitality/vigor. Twenty-three studies reporting on 21 RCTs (N = 2239) met inclusion criteria. MBIs significantly reduced fatigue compared to controls at post-intervention (g = 0.60, 95 % CI [0.36, 0.83]) and first follow-up (g = 0.42, 95 % CI [0.20, 0.64]). Likewise, MBIs significantly improved vitality/vigor at post-intervention (g = 0.39, 95 % CI [0.25, 0.52]) and first follow-up (g = 0.35, 95 % CI [0.03, 0.67]). The evidence grade was low due to risk of bias, substantial heterogeneity, and publication bias among studies. MBIs show promise in improving fatigue and vitality/vigor in cancer survivors. More rigorous trials are needed to address current gaps in the evidence base.

AB  - To categorize and describe the public health informatics (PHI) and global health informatics (GHI) literature between 2012 and 2014.We conducted a semi-systematic review of articles published between January 2012 and September 2014 where information and communications technologies (ICT) was a primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups.A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes.There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles.While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.

AB  - BackgroundLiterature has shown that computerized creatinine clearance alerts reduce errors during prescribing, and applying human factors principles may further reduce errors. Our objective was to apply human factors principles to creatinine clearance alert design and assess whether the redesigned alerts increase usability and reduce prescribing errors compared with the original alerts.MethodsTwenty Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient providers (14 physicians, 2 nurse practitioners, and 4 clinical pharmacists) completed 2 usability sessions in a counterbalanced study to evaluate original and redesigned alerts. Each session consisted of fictional patient scenarios with 3 medications that warranted prescribing changes because of renal impairment, each associated with creatinine clearance alerts. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess alert usability and the occurrence of prescribing errors.ResultsThere were 43% fewer prescribing errors with the redesigned alerts compared with the original alerts (P = .001). Compared with the original alerts, redesigned alerts significantly reduced prescribing errors for allopurinol and ibuprofen (85% vs 40% and 65% vs 25%, P = .012 and P = .008, respectively), but not for spironolactone (85% vs 65%). Nine providers (45%) voiced confusion about why the alert was appearing when they encountered the original alert design. When laboratory links were presented on the redesigned alert, laboratory information was accessed 3.5 times more frequently.ConclusionsAlthough prescribing errors were high with both alert designs, the redesigned alerts significantly improved prescribing outcomes. This investigation provides some of the first evidence on how alerts may be designed to support safer prescribing for patients with renal impairment.

AB  - Global health experiences evoke a profound awareness of cultural differences, inspire learners to prioritize professional values, and provide a lens for addressing global health care challenges. This study compares the long-term career and practice choices of participants in a 2-month Indiana University-Moi University, Kenya elective from 1989-2013 with those of a control group.Global health elective (GHE) participants and a random sample of alumni without GHE experience were surveyed on their clinical practice, public health and global health activities.Responses from 176 former participants were compared with a control group of 177 alumni. GHE participants were more likely than similar controls to provide care to underserved U.S. populations (p=0.037), spend time in global health, public health, and public policy activities (p=0.005) and be involved in global health advocacy (p=0.001). Using multivariable analysis, GHE participants were more likely to be generalists (p<0.05), report that healthcare costs influenced medical decision-making (p<0.05), and provide healthcare outside the U.S. for ≥1 week/year (p<0.001).Many years out of training, GHE participants were more likely to be generalists working with underserved populations, to be cost-conscious in their healthcare decision-making, and to be involved in global health, public health or public policy.With the primary care provider shortage and need for greater awareness among providers of healthcare costs, our study shows that that global health experiences may yield broader benefits to the U.S. medical system.

AB  - For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0–14 years and their caregivers over 6 months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring Systems® (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (≥90 or <90 % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7 days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients.

Associated with advanced adenoma on the second surveillance colonoscopy were age at index colonoscopy (scored 0 for younger than 55 years of age, 1 for 55-59 years of age, 2 for 60-64 years of age, and 3 for older than 65 years of age) and previous findings (non-neoplastic, nonadvanced, advanced [scored 0, 1, and 2, respectively]) on index colonoscopy and the first surveillance colonoscopy, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. Risks of advanced adenoma on the second surveillance colonoscopy with scores of 5 or less and more than 5 were 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.5%-6.4%) and 14.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.4%-25.7%), respectively, comprising 93% and 7%, respectively, of the cohort. Corresponding results in the validation cohort were 5.6% and 19.2%, respectively, comprising 86.1% and 13.9%, respectively, of the cohort.Retrospective study with potential for selection bias.This index stratifies the risk of advanced adenoma on the second surveillance colonoscopy. If validated independently, it may be useful for tailoring surveillance.

AB  - Background: Older people with dementia have increased risk of nursing home (NH) use and higher Medicaid payments. Dementia’s impact on acute care use and Medicare payments is less well understood. Objectives: Identify trajectories of incident dementia and NH use, and compare Medicare and Medicaid payments for persons having different trajectories. Research Design: Retrospective cohort of older patients who were screened for dementia in 2000–2004 and were tracked for 5 years. Trajectories were identified with latent class growth analysis. Subjects: A total of 3673 low-income persons aged 65 or older without dementia at baseline. Measures: Incident dementia diagnosis, comorbid conditions, dual eligibility, acute and long-term care use and payments based on Medicare and Medicaid claims, medical record systems, and administrative data. Results: Three trajectories were identified based on dementia incidence and short-term and long-term NH use: (1) high incidence of dementia with heavy NH use (5% of the cohort) averaging $56,111/year ($36,361 Medicare, $19,749 Medicaid); (2) high incidence of dementia with little or no NH use (16% of the cohort) averaging $16,206/year ($14,644 Medicare, $1562 Medicaid); and (3) low incidence of dementia and little or no NH use (79% of the cohort) averaging $8475/year ($7558 Medicare, $917 Medicaid). Conclusions: Dementia and its interaction with NH utilization are major drivers of publicly financed acute and long-term care payments. Medical providers in Accountable Care Organizations and other health care reform efforts must effectively manage dementia care across the care continuum if they are to be financially viable.

AB  - Background Advances in electronic health record (EHR) systems and health information exchange (HIE) are shifting efforts in public health toward greater use of information systems to automate notifiable disease surveillance. Little is known about infection preventionists' (IPs) awareness, adoption, and use of these technologies to report information to public health. Methods To measure awareness and engagement in EHR and HIE activities, an online survey of IPs was conducted in states with HIE networks. A total of 63 IPs was invited to participate; 44 IPs (69%) responded. The survey asked about the adoption and use of EHR systems, participation in regional HIE initiatives, and IP needs with respect to EHR systems and public health reporting. Results Over 70% of responding IPs reported access to an EHR system, but less than 20% of IPs with access to an EHR reported being involved in the design, selection, or implementation of the system. Just 10% of IPs reported that their organizations were formally engaged in HIE activities, and 49% were unaware of organizational involvement in HIE. IPs expressed a desire for better decision support, paperless reporting methods, and situational awareness of community outbreaks. Conclusion Many IPs lack awareness and engagement in EHR and HIE activities, which may limit IPs ability to influence or utilize key information technologies as they are implemented in health care organizations.

AB  - Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of educational sessions that accompanied breast cancer screening events in three communities in western Kenya between October and November 2013. Five hundred and thirty-two women were recruited to complete a test of breast cancer-relevant knowledge and randomly allocated to 'pre-test' or 'post-test' groups that immediately preceded or followed participation in the educational sessions. The education was organized as a presentation by health professionals and focused mainly on causes of breast cancer, early and late cancer presentation signs, high-risk groups, screening methods to find early-stage breast cancer, self-breast exam procedures and treatment options for this disease. Participants were invited to ask questions and practice finding nodules in silicone breast models. The median age was 35 years (interquartile range: 28-45), and 86% had not undergone breast cancer screening previously. Many individual items in our test of knowledge showed statistically significant shifts to better-informed responses. When all items in the assessment questionnaire were scored as a 'test', on average there was a 2.80 point (95% CI: 2.38, 3.22) significant improvement in knowledge about breast cancer after the educational session. Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of an educational strategy carefully tailored for women in these communities in Kenya.

AB  - Street-connected children and youth (SCCY) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have multiple vulnerabilities in relation to participation in research. These require additional considerations that are responsive to their needs and the social, cultural, and economic context, while upholding core ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The objective of this paper is to describe processes and outcomes of adapting ethical guidelines for SCCY’s specific vulnerabilities in LMIC. As part of three interrelated research projects in western Kenya, we created procedures to address SCCY’s vulnerabilities related to research participation within the local context. These consisted of identifying ethical considerations and solutions in relation to community engagement, equitable recruitment, informed consent, vulnerability to coercion, and responsibility to report. Substantial community engagement provided input on SCCY’s participation in research, recruitment, and consent processes. We designed an assent process to support SCCY to make an informed decision regarding their participation in the research that respected their autonomy and their right to dissent, while safeguarding them in situations where their capacity to make an informed decision was diminished. To address issues related to coercion and access to care, we worked to reduce the unequal power dynamic through street outreach, and provided access to care regardless of research participation. Although a vulnerable population, the specific vulnerabilities of SCCY can to some extent be managed using innovative procedures. Engaging SCCY in ethical research is a matter of justice and will assist in reducing inequities and advancing their health and human dignity.

AB  - Accurately predicting future frequent emergency department (ED) utilization can support a case management approach and ultimately reduce health care costs. This study assesses the feasibility of using routinely collected registration data to predict future frequent ED visits. Using routinely collected registration data in the state of Indiana, U.S.A., from 2008, we developed multivariable logistic regression models to predict frequent ED visits in the subsequent two years. We assessed the model’s accuracy using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and positive predictive value (PPV). Strong predictors of frequent ED visits included age between 25 and 44 years, female gender, close proximity to the ED (less than 5 miles traveling distance), total visits in the baseline year, and respiratory and dental chief complaint syndromes. The area under ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.92 for models predicting patients with 8 or more visits to 16 or more visits in the subsequent two years, suggesting acceptable discrimination. With 25 % sensitivity, the model predicting frequent ED use as defined as 16 or more visits in 2009 and 2010 had a PPV of 59.5 % and specificity of 99.9 %. The “adjusted” PPV of this model, which includes patients having 8 or more visits, is 81.9 %. We demonstrate a strong association between predictor variables present in registration data and frequent ED use. The algorithm’s performance characteristics suggest that it is technically feasible to use routinely collected registration data to predict future frequent ED use.

AB  - Objectives: Delirium is a highly prevalent syndrome of acute brain dysfunction among critically ill patients that has been linked to multiple risk factors, such as age, preexisting cognitive impairment, and use of sedatives; but to date, the relationship between race and delirium is unclear. We conducted this study to identify whether African-American race is a risk factor for developing ICU delirium. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical and surgical ICUs of a university-affiliated, safety net hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Patients: A total of 2,087 consecutive admissions with 1,008 African Americans admitted to the ICU services from May 2009 to August 2012. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Incident delirium was defined as first positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU result after an initial negative Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU; and prevalent delirium was defined as positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU on first Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU assessment. The overall incident delirium rate in African Americans was 8.7% compared with 10.4% in Caucasians ( p = 0.26). The prevalent delirium rate was 14% in both African Americans and Caucasians ( p = 0.95). Significant age and race interactions were detected for incident delirium ( p = 0.02) but not for prevalent delirium ( p = 0.3). The hazard ratio for incident delirium for African Americans in the 18–49 years age group compared with Caucasians of similar age was 0.4 (0.1–0.9). The hazard and odds ratios for incident and prevalent delirium in other groups were not different. Conclusions: African-American race does not confer any additional risk for developing incident or prevalent delirium in the ICU. Instead, younger African Americans tend to have lower rates of incident delirium compared with Caucasians of similar age.

AB  - Purpose Cervical cancer screening has been successful in reducing the rates of cervical cancer in developed countries, but this disease remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to understand factors associated with limited uptake of screening services in our cervical cancer-screening program in Western Kenya. Participants and Methods Using items from a previously validated cancer awareness questionnaire repurposed for use in cervical cancer and culturally adapted for use in Kenya, we interviewed 2,505 women aged 18–55 years receiving care in gynecology clinics or seeking other services in 4 health facilities in Western Kenya between April 2014 and September 2014. We used logistic regression modeling to assess factors associated with uptake (or non-uptake), associated odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results Only two hundred and seventy-three women out of 2505 (11%) accepted VIA cervical cancer screening. Knowledge of just how women are screened for cervical cancer was significantly associated with reduced uptake of cervical cancer screening (OR: 0.53; CI 0.38–0.73) as was fear that screening would reveal a cancer (OR 0.70; CI 0.63–0.77), and reliance on prayer with the onset of illness (OR 0.43; CI 0.26–0.71). Participants who thought that one should get cervical cancer screening even if there were no symptoms were more than twice as likely to accept cervical cancer screening (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.24–3.93). Older patients, patients living with HIV and women who do not know if bleeding immediately after sex might be a sign of cervical cancer were also more likely to accept screening (OR 1.03, CI 1.02–1.04; OR 1.78, CI 1.01–3.14; OR 2.39, CI 1.31–4.39, respectively). Conclusions In our population, a high percent of women knew that it is appropriate for all women to get cervical cancer screening, but only a small proportion of women actually got screening. There may be an opportunity to design educational materials for this population that will not only encourage participation in cervical cancer screening but also remediate misconceptions. The discussion illustrates how our findings could be used in such an effort.

AB  - Background and objective: The first class of oral pharmacologic treatments for overactive bladder (OAB) are antimuscarinics that are associated with poor persistence, anticholinergic adverse events, and increased anticholinergic burden (ACB) with risk of cognitive impairment. Mirabegron, a β3-adrenoceptor agonist, is an oral treatment that does not contribute to ACB and has early evidence of improved persistence. The objective of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron for OAB vs six antimuscarinics in the US.Methods: A Markov state-transition model assessed US commercial health-plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives over a 3-year time horizon in an OAB patient population. Transition probabilities between five micturition and five incontinence severity states were derived from a network meta-analysis of 44 trials of oral OAB treatments. Therapy beginning with an oral OAB agent could discontinue or switch to another oral agent and could be followed by tibial nerve stimulation, sacral neuromodulation, or onabotulinumtoxinA. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Utilities were mapped from incontinence and micturition frequencies as well as demographics. Based on analysis of data from a large healthcare system, elevated ACB was associated with increased healthcare utilization and probability of cognitive impairment.Results: From both commercial and Medicare Advantage perspectives, mirabegron was the most clinically effective treatment, while oxybutynin was the least expensive. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) was also on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The analysis estimated costs per QALY of $59,690 and $66,347 for mirabegron from commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, respectively, compared to tolterodine IR. Other antimuscarinics were dominated.Conclusions: This analysis estimated that mirabegron is a cost-effective treatment for OAB from US commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, due to fewer projected adverse events and comorbidities, and data suggesting better persistence.

AB  - Our study objective was to determine the validity and reliability of the breast module of a cancer awareness measure (BCAM) among adult women in western Kenya.The study was conducted between October and November 2012, following three breast cancer screening events. Purposive and systematic random sampling methods were used to identity 48 women for cognitive focus group discussions, and 1061 (594 who attended vs. 467 who did not attend screening events) for surveys, respectively. Face and psychometric validity of the BCAM survey was assessed using cognitive testing, factor analysis of survey data, and correlations. Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.Among survey participants, the overall median age was 34 (IQR: 26-44) years. Compared to those women who did not attend the screening events, women attendees were older (median: 35 vs. 32 years, p = 0.001) more often married (79% vs. 72%, p = 0.006), more educated (52% vs. 46% with more than an elementary level of education, p = 0.001), more unemployed (59% vs. 11%, p = 0.001), more likely to report doing breast self-examination (56% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and more likely to report having felt a breast lump (16% vs. 7%, p = 0.001). For domain 1 on knowledge of breast cancer symptoms, one factor (three items) with Eigen value of 1.76 emerged for the group that did not attend screening, and 1.50 for the group that attended screening. For both groups two factors (factor 1 "internal influences" and factor 2 "external influences") emerged among domain 4 on barriers to screening, with varied item loadings and Eigen values. There were no statistically significant differences in the factor scores between attendees and non-attendees. There were significant associations between factor scores and other attributes of the surveyed population, including associations with occupation, transportation type, and training for and practice of breast self-examination. Cronbach's alpha showed an acceptable internal consistency.Certain subpopulations are less likely than others to attend breast screening in Kenya. A survey measure of breast cancer knowledge and perceived barriers to screening shows promise for use in Kenya for characterizing clinical and community population beliefs, but needs adaptation for setting, language and culture.

AB  - Older adults' self-care often depends on understanding and utilizing health information. Inadequate health literacy among older adults poses a barrier to self-care because it hampers comprehension of this information, particularly when the information is not well-designed. Our goal was to improve comprehension of online health information among older adults with hypertension who varied in health literacy abilities.We identified passages about hypertension self-care from credible websites (typical passages). We used a multi-faceted approach to redesign these passages, revising their content, language, organization and format (revised passages). Older participants read both versions of the passages at their own pace. After each passage, they summarized the passage and then answered questions about the passage.Participants better remembered the revised than the typical passages, summarizing the passages more accurately and uptaking information more efficiently (less reading time needed per unit of information remembered). The benefits for reading efficiency were greater for older adults with more health knowledge, suggesting knowledge facilitated comprehension of information in the revised passages.A systematic, multi-faceted approach to designing health documents can promote online learning among older adults with diverse health literacy abilities.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is common and associated with poor outcomes after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We sought to determine whether the intervention strategy improved sleep apnea detection, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment, and hypertension control among patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease and hypertension. In this randomized controlled strategy trial intervention, patients received unattended polysomnography at baseline, and patients with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥5 events/h) received auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for up to 1 year. Control patients received usual care and unattended polysomnography at the end of the study, to identify undiagnosed OSA. Both groups received 24-h blood pressure assessments at baseline and end of the study. “Excellent” CPAP adherence was defined as cumulative use of ≥4 h/night for ≥70% of the nights. Among 225 randomized patients (115 control; 110 intervention), 61.9% (120/194) had sleep apnea. The strategy successfully diagnosed sleep apnea with 97.1% (102/105) valid studies; 90.6% (48/53, 95% CI 82.7–98.4%) of sleep apnea was undiagnosed among control patients. The intervention improved long-term excellent CPAP use: 38.6% (22/57) intervention versus 0% (0/2) control (p < 0.0001). The intervention did not improve hypertension control in this population with well-controlled baseline blood pressure: intervention, 132.7 mmHg (±standard deviation, 14.1) versus control, 133.8 mmHg (±14.0) (adjusted difference, −1.1 mmHg, 95% CI (−4.2, 2.0)), p = 0.48). Patients with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension have a high prevalence of OSA. The use of portable polysomnography, and auto-titrating CPAP in the patients’ homes, improved both the diagnosis and the treatment for sleep apnea compared with usual care but did not lower blood pressure.

AB  - Pain is the most common presenting somatic symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety are the two most common mental disorders. They frequently co-occur, are under-treated, and result in substantial disability and reduced health-related quality of life. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Pain Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource technology-assisted intervention for the management of patients suffering from pain plus anxiety and/or depression. CAMMPS has enrolled 294 primary care patients with chronic pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression and randomized them to either: 1) Assisted Symptom Management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by interactive voice recording or Internet and prompted pain and mood self-management; or 2) Comprehensive Symptom Management (CSM) which combines ASM with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist team and facilitated mental health care. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression (PAD) severity score. Secondary outcomes include individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores, health-related quality of life, disability, healthcare utilization, and treatment satisfaction. CAMMPS provides an integrated approach to PAD symptoms rather than fragmented care of single symptoms; coordinated symptom management in partnership with primary care clinicians and psychologists embedded in primary care; efficient use of health information technology; attention to physical and psychological symptom comorbidity; and the coupling of self-management with optimized medication management and facilitated mental health care. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01757301.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with higher rates of postoperative delirium. The relationship between preoperative OSA risk and postoperative delirium and coma in thoracic surgery patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) is not well understood. This study tests the hypothesis that thoracic surgery patients hospitalized in ICU with a higher preoperative risk for OSA are more likely to develop postoperative delirium and coma, resulting in longer hospital stays.Preoperative OSA risk was measured using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. STOP-BANG scores of greater than or equal to 3 were defined as intermediate-high risk for OSA; 128 patients who underwent major thoracic surgery completed the STOP-BANG questionnaire preoperatively. The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale was used to assess level of consciousness. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU was used to assess for delirium. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between risk of OSA and outcome measures. Results were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, instrumental activities of daily living, and surgery type.A total of 96 of 128 patients (76%) were in the intermediate-high-risk OSA group. Adjusted analyses showed that the intermediate-high-risk OSA group had a longer duration of postoperative ICU delirium and coma compared with the low-risk OSA group (1.4 ± 1.3 days versus 0.9 ± 1.4 days; P = 0.04). Total number of hospital days was not significantly different.Higher preoperative risk for OSA in thoracic surgery patients was associated with a longer duration of postoperative delirium and coma.

AB  - More than 90% of neuroblastoma patients are cured in the low-risk group while only less than 50% for those with high-risk disease can be cured. Since the high-risk patients still have poor outcomes, we need more accurate stratification to establish an individualized precise treatment plan for the patients to improve the long-term survival rate. We focus on extracting features and providing a workflow to improve survival prediction for neuroblastoma patients. With a workflow for gene co-expression network (GCN) mining in microarray and RNA-Seq datasets, we extracted molecular features from each co-expressed module and summarized them into eigengenes. Then we adopted the lasso-regularized Cox proportional hazards model to select the most informative eigengene features regarding association to the risk of metastasis. Nine eigengenes were selected which show strong association with patient survival prognosis. All of the nine corresponding gene modules also have highly enriched biological functions or cytoband locations. Three of them are unique modules to RNA-Seq data, which complement the modules from microarray data in terms of survival prognosis. We then merged all eigengenes from these unique modules and used an integrative method called Similarity Network Fusion to test the prognostic power of these eigengenes for prognosis. The prognostic accuracies are significantly improved as compared to using all eigengenes, and a subgroup of patients with very poor survival rate was identified. We first compared GCNs mined from microarray and RNA-seq data. We discovered that each data modality yields unique GCNs, which are enriched with clear biological functions. Then we do module unique analysis and use lasso-cox model to select survival-associated eigengenes. Integration of unique and survival-associated eigengenes from both data types provides complementary information that leads to more accurate survival prognosis.

AB  - Background and purpose Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after cerebral infarction is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon in the acute stage of ischemic stroke, and often results in a poor prognosis. Thus, identifying risk factors and making an early prediction of HT in acute cerebral infarction contributes not only to the selections of therapeutic regimen but also, more importantly, to the improvement of prognosis of acute cerebral infarction. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model to predict a patient’s risk of HT within 30 days of initial ischemic stroke. Methods We utilized a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study design to develop a Lasso Logistic Regression prediction model with a large, US Electronic Health Record dataset which structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). To examine clinical transportability, the model was externally validated across 10 additional real-world healthcare datasets include EHR records for patients from America, Europe and Asia. Results In the database the model was developed, the target population cohort contained 621,178 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 5,624 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. 612 risk predictors, including the distance a patient travels in an ambulance to get to care for a HT, were identified. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 was achieved in the internal validation of the risk model. External validation was performed across 10 databases totaling 5,515,508 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 86,401 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. The mean external AUC was 0.71 and ranged between 0.60–0.78. Conclusions A HT prognostic predict model was developed with Lasso Logistic Regression based on routinely collected EMR data. This model can identify patients who have a higher risk of HT than the population average with an AUC of 0.78. It shows the OMOP CDM is an appropriate data standard for EMR secondary use in clinical multicenter research for prognostic prediction model development and validation. In the future, combining this model with clinical information systems will assist clinicians to make the right therapy decision for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> An important aspect of high-quality care is ensuring that treatments are in alignment with patient or surrogate decision-maker goals. Treatment discordant with patient goals has been shown to increase medical costs and prolong end-of-life difficulties. <h3>Objectives</h3> To evaluate discordance between surrogate decision-maker goals of care and medical orders and treatments provided to hospitalized, incapacitated older patients. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This prospective cohort study included 363 patient-surrogate dyads. Patients were 65 years or older and faced at least 1 major medical decision in the medical and medical intensive care unit services in 3 tertiary care hospitals in an urban Midwestern area. Data were collected from April 27, 2012, through July 10, 2015, and analyzed from October 5, 2018, to December 5, 2019. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Each surrogate’s preferred goal of care was determined via interview during initial hospitalization and 6 to 8 weeks after discharge. Surrogates were asked to select the goal of care for the patient from 3 options: comfort-focused care, life-sustaining treatment, or an intermediate option. To assess discordance, the preferred goal of care as determined by the surrogate was compared with data from medical record review outlining the medical treatment received during the target hospitalization. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 363 dyads consisting of patients (223 women [61.4%]; mean [SD] age, 81.8 [8.3] years) and their surrogates (257 women [70.8%]; mean [SD] age, 58.3 [11.2] years) were included in the analysis. One hundred sixty-nine patients (46.6%) received at least 1 medical treatment discordant from their surrogate’s identified goals of care. The most common type of discordance involved full-code orders for patients with a goal of comfort (n = 41) or an intermediate option (n = 93). More frequent in-person contact between surrogate and patient (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.82), patient residence in an institution (AOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.82), and surrogate-rated quality of communication (AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) were associated with lower discordance. Surrogate marital status (AOR for single vs married, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.01-3.66), number of family members involved in decisions (AOR for ≥2 vs 0-1, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.05-3.21), and religious affiliation (AOR for none vs any, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.12-21.09) were associated with higher discordance. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study found that discordance between surrogate goals of care and medical treatments for hospitalized, incapacitated patients was common. Communication quality is a modifiable factor associated with discordance that may be an avenue for future interventions.

AB  - Consolidation immunotherapy after completion of chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and can induce potentially severe and life-threatening adverse events, including both immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) and radiation pneumonitis (RP), which are very challenging for radiologists to diagnose. Differentiating between CIP and RP has significant implications for clinical management such as the treatments for pneumonitis and the decision to continue or restart immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to differentiate between CIP and RP by a CT radiomics approach.We retrospectively collected the CT images and clinical information of patients with pneumonitis who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) only (n = 28), radiotherapy (RT) only (n = 31), and ICI+RT (n = 14). Three kinds of radiomic features (intensity histogram, gray-level co-occurrence matrix [GLCM] based, and bag-of-words [BoW] features) were extracted from CT images, which characterize tissue texture at different scales. Classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and linear SVM, were first developed and tested in patients who received ICI or RT only with 10-fold cross-validation and further tested in patients who received ICI+RT using clinicians' diagnosis as a reference.Using 10-fold cross-validation, the classification models built on the intensity histogram features, GLCM-based features, and BoW features achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.765, 0.848, and 0.937, respectively. The best model was then applied to the patients receiving combination treatment, achieving an AUC of 0.896.This study demonstrates the promising potential of radiomic analysis of CT images for differentiating between CIP and RP in lung cancer, which could be a useful tool to attribute the cause of pneumonitis in patients who receive both ICI and RT.

AB  - We examined the association between anticholinergic medication exposure and subsequent cognitive and physical function in patients with delirium superimposed on dementia during rehabilitation. We also examined length of stay and discharge disposition by anticholinergic medication exposure.In this secondary analysis we used control group data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial.Participants with delirium and dementia were enrolled at admission to post-acute care. These 99 participants had a mean age of 86.11 (±6.83) years; 67.6% were women; 98% were Caucasian; and 33% were positive for at least one APOE e4 allele.We obtained daily measures of cognitive and physical function using: Digit Span; memory, orientation and attention items from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; CLOX; the Confusion Assessment Method; and the Barthel Index. Anticholinergic medication exposure was measured weekly using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale.Using multilevel models for time we found that greater use of clinically relevant anticholinergic medications in the previous week reduced cognitive and physical function, as measured by Digit Span Backwards and the Barthel index, in the current week. There was no effect of anticholinergic medication use on delirium severity, and APOE status did not moderate any outcomes. Greater use of clinically relevant anticholinergic medications was related to longer length of stay but not discharge disposition.For vulnerable older adults, anticholinergic exposure represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for poor attention, working memory, physical function, and greater length of stay during rehabilitation.

AB  - Information collection, storage, and management is central to the practice of health care. For centuries, patients’ and providers’ expectations kept medical records confidential between providers and patients. With the advent of electronic health records, patient health information has become more widely available to providers and health care managers and has broadened its potential use beyond individual patient care. Adhering to the principles of Fair Information Practice, including giving patients control over the availability and use of their individual health records, would improve care by fostering the sharing of sensitive information between patients and providers. However, adherence to such principles could put patients at risk for unsafe care as a result of both missed opportunities for providing needed care as well as provision of contraindicated care, as it would prevent health care providers from having full access to health information. Patients’ expectations for the highest possible quality and safety of care, therefore, may be at odds with their desire to limit provider access to their health records. Conversely, provider expectations that patients would willingly seek care for embarrassing conditions and disclose sensitive information may be at odds with patients’ information privacy rights. An open dialogue between patients and providers will be necessary to balance respect for patient rights with provider need for patient information.

AB  - Abstract Background As part of the debate about screening for dementia, it is critical to understand why patients agree or disagree to diagnostic assessment after a positive screening test. We used the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM‐PC) questionnaire to measure the characteristics of patients who screened positive for dementia but refused further diagnostic assessment. Methods Survey of patients ≥65 years old without a diagnosis of dementia attending primary care clinics in Indianapolis, IN, in 2008 and 2009. Results Five hundred and fifty‐four individuals completed the PRISM‐PC and 63 screened positive. Of those, 21 (33%) accepted and 42 (67%) refused diagnostic assessment. In adjusted models, having larger stigma domain scores and living alone were significantly associated with increased odds of refusing the diagnostic assessment. Conclusion Despite screening positive, many patients refused a diagnostic assessment. Living alone and the perceived stigmas of dementia are associated with the refusal of diagnostic assessment for dementia.

AB  - To compare the effect of obesity and related risk factors on 10-year mortality in two cohorts of older adults of African descent; one from the United States and one from Nigeria.Study participants were community residents aged 70 or older of African descent living in Indianapolis, Indiana (N = 1,269) or Ibadan, Nigeria (1,197). We compared survival curves between the two cohorts by obesity class and estimated the effect of obesity class on mortality in Cox proportional hazards models controlling for age, gender, alcohol use, and smoking history, and the cardiometabolic biomarkers blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and C-reactive protein.We found that underweight was associated with an increased risk of death in both the Yoruba (hazards ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.63) and African American samples (hazards ratio = 2.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.40-4.43) compared with those with normal weight. The overweight and obese participants in both cohorts experienced survival similar to the normal weight participants. Controlling for cardiometabolic biomarkers had little effect on the obesity-specific hazard ratios in either cohort.Despite significant differences across these two cohorts in terms of obesity and biomarker levels, overall 10-year survival and obesity class-specific survival were remarkably similar.

AB  - <b>Background and study aims:</b> The risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) after the first surveillance colonoscopy is not well quantified. The aim of the current study was to quantify the risk of ACN on the second surveillance colonoscopy based on previous colonoscopic findings. <b>Patients and methods:</b> This was a single-site study of patients with index adenomas who underwent two surveillance colonoscopies. ACN was defined as advanced adenoma (≥ 1 cm, villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia) or as “high-risk” findings (advanced adenoma or ≥ 3 non-advanced adenoma [NAA]). <b>Results:</b> Among 509 patients with low-risk index findings, 61 (12.0 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 9.3 % – 15.1 %) had high-risk findings on the first surveillance colonoscopy, 11 of whom (18.0 %; 95 %CI 9.4 % – 30.0 %) had high-risk findings on second surveillance colonoscopy compared with 39 (8.7 %; 95 %CI 6.3 % – 11.7 %) of the remaining 448 patients who had normal or low-risk findings on the first surveillance colonoscopy (relative risk [RR] = 2.07; 95 %CI 1.12 – 3.83). Among 456 patients with high-risk index findings, 91 (20.0 %; 95 %CI 16.3 % – 23.9 %) had high-risk findings on the first surveillance colonoscopy, 20 of whom (22.0 %; 95 %CI 14.0 % – 31.9 %) had high-risk findings on second surveillance colonoscopy compared with 40 (11.0 %; 95 %CI 8.0 % – 146 %) of the remaining 365 patients who had normal or low-risk findings on first surveillance colonoscopy (RR = 2.01; 95 %CI 1.04 – 3.32). Results were similar when only advanced adenomas were considered. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with high-risk findings on index and first surveillance colonoscopies require close surveillance. Those with low-risk findings on index colonoscopy and normal/non-advanced findings on the first surveillance colonoscopy have low subsequent risk of ACN. These and previous data may be useful for generating recommendations for the timing of the second surveillance colonoscopy.

AB  - In this study we have developed a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) system to identify patients with family history of pancreatic cancer. The algorithm was developed in a Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) framework and consisted of section segmentation, relation discovery, and negation detection. The system was evaluated on data from two institutions. The family history identification precision was consistent across the institutions shifting from 88.9% on Indiana University (IU) dataset to 87.8% on Mayo Clinic dataset. Customizing the algorithm on the the Mayo Clinic data, increased its precision to 88.1%. The family member relation discovery achieved precision, recall, and F-measure of 75.3%, 91.6% and 82.6% respectively. Negation detection resulted in precision of 99.1%. The results show that rule-based NLP approaches for specific information extraction tasks are portable across institutions; however customization of the algorithm on the new dataset improves its performance.

AB  - Clinician empathy is a well-documented component of effective patient/provider communication. Evidence surrounding the association between patient perspectives on clinician empathy and perception of pain management is currently limited, particularly among patients with chronic pain and depression. The aim of this study was to analyze patients’ perspectives on the emergent theme of empathy and describe how patients construct their experiences and expectations surrounding empathic interactions. A secondary analysis of focus group data was designed using grounded theory methodology. Veterans Affairs (VA) and University Primary Care Clinics. Respondents with chronic pain and comorbid depression (N = 18) were 27 to 84 years old (mean 54.8 years), 61% women, 22% black, and 74% white. Study participants highly valued empathy and two types of empathic interactions: empathic listening and empathic action. Patients who provided examples of empathic interactions claimed that others understood, valued, and cared for them. In contrast, patients who perceived a lack of empathy and empathic interactions felt frustrated and uncared for by others (including their physicians) physically and emotionally. Patients with chronic pain and depression claimed that empathy helped them feel understood, believed, taken seriously, and that their needs were met. In demonstrating empathy and engaging in empathic interactions with patients, providers relate better to patients, better understand their life experience, and provide patient-centered care that is meaningful for patients, providers, and the health care systems within which they interact. Future research is needed to purposefully study the effects of empathic interactions on outcomes for patients with chronic pain and comorbid depression.

AB  - Radiology procedure codes are a fundamental part of most radiology workflows, such as ordering, scheduling, billing, and image interpretation. Nonstandardized unstructured procedure codes have typically been used in radiology departments. Such codes may be sufficient for specific purposes, but they offer limited support for interoperability. As radiology workflows and the various forms of clinical data exchange have become more sophisticated, the need for more advanced interoperability with use of standardized structured codes has increased. For example, structured codes facilitate the automated identification of relevant prior imaging studies and the collection of data for radiation dose tracking. The authors review the role of imaging procedure codes in radiology departments and across the health care enterprise. Standards for radiology procedure coding are described, and the mechanisms of structured coding systems are reviewed. In particular, the structure of the RadLex™ Playbook coding system and examples of the use of this system are described. Harmonization of the RadLex Playbook system with the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes standard, which is currently in progress, also is described. The benefits and challenges of adopting standardized codes—especially the difficulties in mapping local codes to standardized codes—are reviewed. Tools and strategies for mitigating these challenges, including the use of billing codes as an intermediate step in mapping, also are reviewed. In addition, the authors describe how to use the RadLex Playbook Web service application programming interface for partial automation of code mapping. © RSNA, 2017

AB  - Background & AimsColorectal cancer incidence and mortality are higher in black vs white populations. The reasons for these disparities are not clear, yet some guidelines recommend screening black persons for colorectal cancer starting at 40–45 years of age. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the prevalence of advanced adenomas (AAs) and advanced precancerous colorectal neoplasms (ACNs) between asymptomatic black and white screen-eligible adults.MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify articles (published from 1946 through June 2017) that reported prevalence values of AA or ACN in average-risk black and white individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy. Two authors independently assessed study quality and risk for bias using a modified validated quality assessment instrument. In accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 2 authors independently abstracted descriptive and quantitative data from each study. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to determine risk differences and odds ratios (ORs).ResultsOf 1653 articles, we identified 9 studies for analysis that included 302,128 individuals. Six of the 9 studies were of high methodologic quality, and had a low risk for bias. In these 9 studies, the overall prevalence values for AA and ACN did not differ significantly between black (6.57%) and white (6.20%) screened individuals (OR 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81–1.30). In a subgroup of 5 studies, the prevalence of proximal AA and ACN was significantly higher in black (3.30%) than in white (2.42%) screened individuals (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12–1.30). Excluding the largest study did not affect overall prevalence (OR 0.99; CI 0.73–1.34) but did eliminate the difference in prevalence of proximal AA or ACN (OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.87–2.52).ConclusionsIn this meta-analysis, we found the overall prevalence of AA and ACN did not differ significantly between average-risk black and white persons, indicating that the age at which to begin colorectal cancer screening need not differ based on race alone.

AB  - Successful implementation of new clinical programs depends on effectively establishing, reorganizing, or enhancing team structures and processes to coordinate the work of individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, manage relationships, and share responsibility for outcomes. However, a one-size-fits-all approach is rarely effective. In partnership with VA national clinical leaders and local clinical champions, the Optimizing Function and Independence VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative program (Function QUERI) will evaluate efforts to implement team-based clinical programs for Veterans at risk for functional decline and disability. Function QUERI will implement and evaluate three innovative, evidence-based clinical programs in VA medical centers: (1) a group physical therapy program for knee osteoarthritis (Group PT); (2) assisted early mobility for hospitalized older veterans (STRIDE), a supervised walking program for hospitalized older veterans; and (3) implementation of helping invested family members improve veteran experiences study (iHI-FIVES), a skills training program for caregivers of disabled Veterans. A common reason for clinical care gaps in these populations is poor communication and coordination among the many interdisciplinary providers involved in their care. To facilitate the implementation of the clinical programs, Function QUERI will evaluate the impact of complexity science-based implementation intervention to promote team readiness (CONNECT), an implementation intervention designed as a bundle of interaction-oriented activities to promote team function and readiness for change, on the implementation of clinical programs across multiple sites. The evaluation will use a mixed methods design. Group PT is a local, single-site quality improvement project where a modified CONNECT intervention will be tested to inform the remaining program implementation projects. For STRIDE and iHI-FIVES projects, we will randomize participating sites to implement the clinical program, with the CONNECT intervention or not, and will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design. Function QUERI will translate its findings across its projects to identify the contextual factors and components from CONNECT that improve team processes and function to optimize effective implementation for future rollout of VA clinical programs. Synthesizing findings within and across projects, we will specify dimensions of team characteristics and function that enhance capacity for clinical innovation and uptake of evidence-based programs.

AB  - Music listening has been shown to reduce anxiety, stress, and patient tolerance of procedures. Music may also have beneficial effects on inflammatory biomarkers in intensive care and post-operative patients, but the quality of evidence is not clear.We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effects of music on inflammatory biomarkers in intensive care, and post-operative patients.A comprehensive search of the literature was performed. After screening 1570 references, full text review of 26 studies was performed. Fourteen studies were selected for inclusion.Seven studies showed a significant decrease in cortisol levels, but the level of evidence was low. Three studies had low risk of methodological bias, while 11 studies had high risk of bias.Music intervention may decrease cortisol levels, but other biomarkers remain unchanged. Given the low level of evidence, further research on music effects on inflammatory biomarkers is needed.

AB  - Objectives: To compare activities and field descriptions of clinical champions across three levels of stroke centers. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study using quota sampling was conducted. The setting for this study was 38 acute stroke centers based in US Veterans Affairs Medical Centers with 8 designated as Primary, 24 as Limited Hours, and 6 as Stroke Support Centers. Key informants involved in stroke care were interviewed using a semi-structured approach. A cross-case synthesis approach was used to conduct a qualitative analysis of clinical champions’ behaviors and characteristics. Clinical champion behaviors were described and categorized across three dimensions: enthusiasm, persistence, and involving the right people. Results: Clinical champions at Primary Stroke Centers represented diverse medical disciplines and departments (education, quality management); directed implementation of acute stroke care processes; coordinated processes across service lines; and benefited from supportive contexts for implementation. Clinical champions at Limited Hours Stroke Centers varied in steering implementation efforts, building collaboration across disciplines, and engaging in other clinical champion activities. Clinical champions at Stroke Support Centers were implementing limited changes to stroke care and exhibited few behaviors fitting the three clinical champion dimensions. Other clinical champion behaviors included educating colleagues, problem-solving, implementing new care pathways, monitoring progress, and standardizing processes. Conclusion: These data demonstrate clinical champion behaviors for implementing changes to complex care processes such as acute stroke care. Changes to complex care processes involved coordination among clinicians from multiple services lines, persistence facing obstacles to change, and enthusiasm for targeted practice changes.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project is a successful, multicomponent demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long‐stay nursing facility residents. Systematic advance care planning (ACP) is a core component of the intervention, based on research suggesting ACP is associated with decreased hospitalizations of nursing facility residents. The purpose of this study was to describe associations between ACP documentation resulting from the OPTIMISTIC intervention and hospitalizations. DESIGN Specially trained project nurses were embedded in 19 nursing facilities and systematically engaged in ACP as part of a larger demonstration project. PARTICIPANTS Residents (n = 1482) enrolled in the demonstration project for a minimum of 30 days between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. MEASUREMENTS ACP status: (1) Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST) comfort measures or do not hospitalize (DNH) orders; (2) ACP orders with no hospitalization limit (eg, code status only); and (3) no ACP (potentially avoidable and all‐cause hospitalizations per 1000 resident days). RESULTS Residents with POST comfort measures/DNH orders (33.2% or n = 493) were less likely than residents with no ACP (14.7% or n = 218) to experience a potentially avoidable hospitalization ( P = .001) or all‐cause hospitalization ( P = .001). These differences became statistically nonsignificant after adjusting for age, functional status, and cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION In this successful multicomponent demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations, ACP outcomes were not associated with hospitalization rates of nursing facility residents after adjusting for resident characteristics. These findings highlight the challenge of measuring the contributions of individual components of complex, multicomponent interventions. Associations between lower hospitalization rates and ACP completion may be influenced by contextual factors, such as clinical expertise and resources to manage acute conditions leading to hospitalization, in addition to interventions to increase ACP.

AB  - Abstract Aims Although left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is routinely used to categorize patients with heart failure (HF), whether it predicts outcomes after hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) is uncertain. Consequently, we assessed the relationship between LVEF and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in a large, well characterized cohort of patients hospitalized for AHF. Methods and results The 6128 patients from the RELAX‐AHF‐2 trial who had LVEF measured during AHF hospitalization were separated into LVEF quartiles and the relationship between LVEF and a composite of CV mortality and rehospitalization for HF or renal failure through 180 days was assessed. We found progressively lower risk for this composite outcome as LVEF increased (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.93–0.98 per 5% LVEF increase, P &lt; 0.001) that was driven predominantly by decreased risk for rehospitalization. The smoothed spline curve depicting risk remained stable as LVEF decreased until reaching approximately 40%, at which point risk increased progressively with further reductions in LVEF. Significant differences between LVEF quartiles for post‐discharge CV risk were seen in patients with an ischaemic aetiology or with a history of HF preceding index hospitalization, but were less robust in patients with non‐ischaemic aetiology and absent in those with de novo HF. Conclusion In patients hospitalized with AHF, CV events over 180 days were more frequent in patients with lower LVEF. This was due predominantly to a significant increase in risk for HF/renal failure rehospitalization but not in either CV or all‐cause mortality. LVEF had greater prognostic value in patients with ischaemic aetiology or pre‐existing HF.

AB  - Abstract Background Mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) programs can improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates, but health systems vary how they implement (i.e., adapt) these programs for their organizations. A health insurance plan implemented a mailed FIT program (named BeneFIT), and participating health systems could adapt the program. This multi-method study explored which program adaptations might have resulted in higher screening rates. Methods First, we conducted a descriptive analysis of CRC screening rates by key health system characteristics and program adaptations. Second, we generated an overall model by fitting a weighted regression line to our data. Third, we applied Configurational Comparative Methods (CCMs) to determine how combinations of conditions were linked to higher screening rates. The main outcome measure was CRC screening rates. Results Seventeen health systems took part in at least 1 year of BeneFIT. The overall screening completion rate was 20% (4–28%) in year 1 and 25% (12–35%) in year 2 of the program. Health systems that used two or more adaptations had higher screening rates, and no single adaptation clearly led to higher screening rates. In year 1, small systems, with just one clinic, that used phone reminders ( n = 2) met the implementation success threshold (≥ 19% screening rate) while systems with &gt; 1 clinic were successful when offering a patient incentive ( n = 4), scrubbing mailing lists ( n = 4), or allowing mailed FIT returns with no other adaptations ( n = 1). In year 2, larger systems with 2–4 clinics were successful with a phone reminder ( n = 4) or a patient incentive ( n = 3). Of the 10 systems that implemented BeneFIT in both years, seven improved their CRC screening rates in year 2. Conclusions Health systems can choose among many adaptations and successfully implement a health plan’s mailed FIT program. Different combinations of adaptations led to success with health system size emerging as an important contextual factor.

AB  - Spectral response (or sensitivity) functions of a three-color image sensor (or trichromatic camera) allow a mapping from spectral stimuli to RGB color values. Like biological photosensors, digital RGB spectral responses are device dependent and significantly vary from model to model. Thus, the information on the RGB spectral response functions of a specific device is vital in a variety of computer vision as well as mobile health (mHealth) applications. Theoretically, spectral response functions can directly be measured with sophisticated calibration equipment in a specialized laboratory setting, which is not easily accessible for most application developers. As a result, several mathematical methods have been proposed relying on standard color references. Typical optimization frameworks with constraints are often complicated, requiring a large number of colors. We report a compressive sensing framework in the frequency domain for accurately predicting RGB spectral response functions only with several primary colors. Using a scientific camera, we first validate the estimation method with direct spectral sensitivity measurements and ensure that the root mean square errors between the ground truth and recovered RGB spectral response functions are negligible. We further recover the RGB spectral response functions of smartphones and validate with an expanded color checker reference. We expect that this simple yet reliable estimation method of RGB spectral sensitivity can easily be applied for color calibration and standardization in machine vision, hyperspectral filters, and mHealth applications that capitalize on the built-in cameras of smartphones.

AB  - To review evidence regarding the use of Health Information Technology (health IT) interventions aimed at improving care for people living with multiple chronic conditions (PLWMCC) in order to identify critical knowledge gaps.We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Compendex, and IEEE Xplore databases for studies published in English between 2010 and 2020.We identified studies of health IT interventions for PLWMCC across three domains as follows: self-management support, care coordination, and algorithms to support clinical decision making.Structured search queries were created and validated. Abstracts were reviewed iteratively to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was supplemented by manually searching the bibliographic sections of the included studies. The search included a forward citation search of studies nested within a clinical trial to identify the clinical trial protocol and published clinical trial results. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers.The search yielded 1907 articles; 44 were included. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 35 other studies including quasi-experimental, usability, feasibility, qualitative studies, or development/validation studies of analytic models were included. Five RCTs had positive results, and the remaining four RCTs showed that the interventions had no effect. The studies address individual patient engagement and assess patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life. Few RCTs assess outcomes such as disability and none assess mortality.Despite a growing body of literature on health IT interventions or multicomponent interventions including a health IT component for chronic disease management, current evidence for applying health IT solutions to improve care for PLWMCC is limited. The body of literature included in this review provides critical information on the state of the science as well as the many gaps that need to be filled for digital health to fulfill its promise in supporting care delivery that meets the needs of PLWMCC.

AB  - To understand facilitators and barriers to participation in a peer support intervention for self-management of chronic pain.After completing a pilot intervention study, peer coaches and their veteran patients took part in a qualitative, semistructured interview to explore their experiences with the intervention. Data were analyzed using an immersion/crystallization approach.Three facilitators and 2 barriers to patient participation in a peer support intervention for veterans with chronic pain emerged. Facilitators were (1) having a shared identity as veterans, (2) being partnered with a person who also has chronic pain, and (3) support from the study staff. Barriers were (1) logistical challenges, and (2) challenges to motivation and engagement in the intervention.Awareness of facilitators and barriers to participation in a peer-supported self-management program for chronic pain, as well as strategies to capitalize on facilitators and mitigate barriers, are essential for further study and ultimate clinical implementation of such a program.

AB  - We targeted stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors to engage in self-management practices to manage secondary stroke risk factors. We conducted a randomized, regional pilot trial of a locally adapted, secondary stroke prevention program. We implemented the program at two Veterans Administration Medical Centers. Program sessions targeted stroke risk factor self-management. Specifically, we evaluated the effect of the program on the reach, implementation, and effectiveness on patient self-efficacy; stroke-specific, health-related quality of life; and medication adherence for the prevalent stroke risk factors: (1) diabetes, (2) hypertension, and (3) hyperlipidemia. Medication possession ratios were calculated to evaluate medication adherence using VA pharmacy benefits data pre (6 months prior) and post (6 months after) the stroke/TIA event. Based upon the literature standard of 80 % compliance rate, we dichotomized compliance and modeled the data using logistical regression. Final sample included 174 veterans with an acute stroke or TIA who were randomized to receive either the intervention (n = 87) or attention control program (n = 87). Patient self-efficacy and stroke-specific, health-related quality of life at 6 months did not significantly differ between groups. We found improvements in medication adherence within the intervention group. In the intervention group, the odds of compliance with diabetes medications post-stroke were significantly larger than the odds of compliance prior to the stroke (odds ratio = 3.45 (95 % CI = 1.08–10.96). For compliance to hypertension medications, the intervention group showed significantly greater odds of compliance post intervention than pre intervention (odds ratio = 3. 68 (95 % CI = 1.81–7.48). The control group showed no difference in compliance rates from baseline to follow-up. For adherence to hypercholesterolemia medications, both the intervention (odds ratio = 5.98 (95 % CI = 2.81–12.76) and control groups (odds ratio = 3.83 (95 % CI = 1.83–8.01), had significant increases in the odds of compliance to statin medications; however, the comparison of changes in log odds of compliance between these two groups showed that the increases were not significantly different. We observed within group improvements in medication adherence among those receiving a post-stroke risk factor self-management program suggesting that a self-management format may be feasible to enable adherence to prescribed medications to reduce secondary stroke risk after stroke in concordance with guideline care. Additional research is needed to enhance intervention components to improve effectiveness outcomes.

AB  - Current US colorectal cancer screening guidelines that call for shared decision making regarding the choice among several recommended screening options are difficult to implement. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an established method well suited for supporting shared decision making. Our study goal was to determine whether a streamlined form of MCDA using rank-order-based judgments can accurately assess patients' colorectal cancer screening priorities.We converted priorities for 4 decision criteria and 3 subcriteria regarding colorectal cancer screening obtained from 484 average-risk patients using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a prior study into rank-order-based priorities using rank order centroids. We compared the 2 sets of priorities using Spearman rank correlation and nonparametric Bland-Altman limits of agreement analysis. We assessed the differential impact of using the rank-order-based versus the AHP-based priorities on the results of a full MCDA comparing 3 currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Generalizability of the results was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation.Correlations between the 2 sets of priorities for the 7 criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. The proportions of differences between rank-order-based and AHP-based priorities that were more than ±0.15 ranged from 1% to 16%. Differences in the full MCDA results were minimal, and the relative rankings of the 3 screening options were identical more than 88% of the time. The Monte Carlo simulation results were similar.Rank-order-based MCDA could be a simple, practical way to guide individual decisions and assess population decision priorities regarding colorectal cancer screening strategies. Additional research is warranted to further explore the use of these methods for promoting shared decision making.

AB  - Objective Efficient, effective health care requires rapid availability of patient information. We designed, implemented, and assessed the impact of a primary care electronic medical record (EMR) in three rural Kenyan health centers. Method Local clinicians identified data required for primary care and public health reporting. We designed paper encounter forms to capture these data in adult medicine, pediatric, and antenatal clinics. Encounter form data were hand-entered into a new primary care module in an existing EMR serving onsite clinics serving patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Before subsequent visits, Summary Reports were printed containing selected patient data with reminders for needed HIV care. We assessed effects on patient flow and provider work with time-motion studies before implementation and two years later, and we surveyed providers’ satisfaction with the EMR. Results Between September 2008 and December 2011, 72 635 primary care patients were registered and 114 480 encounter forms were completed. During 2011, 32 193 unique patients visited primary care clinics, and encounter forms were completed for all visits. Of 1031 (3.2%) who were HIV-infected, 85% received HIV care. Patient clinic time increased from 37 to 81 min/visit after EMR implementation in one health center and 56 to 106 min/visit in the other. However, outpatient visits to both health centers increased by 85%. Three-quarters of increased time was spent waiting. Despite nearly doubling visits, there was no change in clinical officers’ work patterns, but the nurses’ and the clerks’ patient care time decreased after EMR implementation. Providers were generally satisfied with the EMR but desired additional training. Conclusions We successfully implemented a primary care EMR in three rural Kenyan health centers. Patient waiting time was dramatically lengthened while the nurses’ and the clerks’ patient care time decreased. Long-term use of EMRs in such settings will require changes in culture and workflow.

AB  - In Brief Background Individuals entering jails have high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI), but there are few data on STI in the postincarceration period. This study aimed to describe rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infection among individuals released from Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana jails. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals incarcerated in Marion County, Indiana jails from 2003 to 2008 (n = 118,670). We linked county jail and public health data to identify individuals with positive STI test results in the 1 year after release from jail. Rates per 100,000 individuals and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for each STI, stratified by demographic, STI, and jail characteristics. Results We found significantly higher rates of STI in this cohort than in the general population, with rates in the 1 year after release being 2 to 7 times higher for chlamydia, 5 to 24 times higher for gonorrhea, and 19 to 32 times higher for syphilis compared with rates in the general population. Characteristics most associated with increased risk of a positive STI test result among this cohort were younger age for chlamydia and gonorrhea, older age for syphilis, black race for men, being jailed for prostitution for women, history of STI, and history of prior incarceration. Conclusions This study found high rates of STIs among a cohort of individuals recently released from jail and identified a number of risk factors. Further study is needed to improve targeted STI testing and treatment among this high-risk population. A study of individuals released from jail in Marion County, Indiana, found high rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis positivity after release and describes factors associated with positivity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Because depression and anxiety are typically studied in isolation, our purpose was to examine the relative importance of these overlapping emotional factors in predicting incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods We examined depression and anxiety screens, and their individual items, as predictors of incident hard CVD events, myocardial infarction, and stroke for 8 years in a diverse sample of 2041 older primary care patients initially free of CVD. At baseline, participants completed self-report depression and anxiety screens. Data regarding CVD events were obtained from an electronic medical record system and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analytic files. Results During follow-up, 683 (33%) experienced a CVD event. Cox proportional hazards models—adjusted for demographic and CVD risk factors—revealed that a positive anxiety screen, but not a positive depression screen, was associated with an increased risk of a hard CVD event in separate models (Years 0–3: anxiety hazard ratio [HR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21−1.96, p &lt; .001; Years 3+: anxiety HR = 0.99, CI = 0.81−1.21), p = .93; depression HR = 1.10, CI = 0.88−1.36, p = .41), as well as when entered into the same model (Years 0–3: anxiety HR = 1.53, CI = 1.20−1.95, p &lt; .001; Years 3+: anxiety HR = 0.99, CI = 0.80−1.21, p = .99; depression HR = 1.03, CI = 0.82−1.29, p = .82). Analyses examining individual items and secondary outcomes showed that the anxiety-CVD association was largely driven by the feeling anxious item and the myocardial infarction outcome. Conclusions Anxiety, especially feeling anxious, is a unique risk factor for CVD events in older adults, independent of conventional risk factors and depression. Anxiety deserves increased attention as a potential factor relevant to CVD risk stratification and a potential target of CVD primary prevention efforts.

AB  - We assembled a cross-cutting team of experts representing primary care physicians (PCPs), home care physicians, physicians who see patients in skilled nursing facilities (SNF physicians), skilled nursing facility medical directors, human factors engineers, transitional care researchers, geriatricians, internists, family practitioners, and three major organizations: AMDA, SGIM, and AGS. This work was sponsored through a grant from the Association of Subspecialty Physicians (ASP). Members of the team mapped the process of discharging patients from a skilled nursing facility into the community and subsequent care of their outpatient PCP. Four areas of process improvement were identified, building on the prior work of the AMDA Transitions of Care Committee and the experiences of the team members. The team identified issues and developed best practices perceived as feasible for SNF physician and PCP practices to accomplish. The goal of these consensus-based recommended best practices is to provide a safe and high-quality transition for patients moving between the care of their SNF physician and PCP.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 family members who had recently been involved in a nursing home to hospital transfer decision.Family members perceived themselves to play an advocacy role in their resident's care and interview themes clustered within three over-arching categories: Family perception of the nursing home's capacity to provide medical care: Resident and family choices; and issues at 'hand-off' and the hospital. Multiple sub-themes were also identified.Findings from this study contribute to knowledge surrounding the nursing home transfer decision by illuminating the experiences of family members in the transfer decision process.

AB  - Among the identified barriers to HPV vaccination is the concern that women may compensate for their reduced susceptibility to cervical cancers by reducing cervical cancer screening. This exploratory study examined the relationship between cervical cancer screening rates and HPV vaccination. We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a convenience sample of women aged 21-35 attending a local minority health fair in July 2015. Data were analyzed in 2015-2016. Outcomes assessed were: receiving a Pap test within the last three years, awareness and comfort with current Pap test recommendations, and knowledge regarding the purpose of a Pap test. A total of 291 women were included in the analyses. Mean age was 28.5 years and 62% were non-Hispanic black. 84% had received a Pap test in the last three years and 33% had received at least one HPV vaccine. Logistic regression results showed that women who had been vaccinated did not have lower odds of having a Pap test in the past three years (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 0.66-2.65). In an adjusted regression model controlling for age and race, vaccinated women were significantly more likely to have had a Pap test (AOR = 3.06; 95% CI = 1.37-6.83). Yet only 26% of women knew the purpose of a Pap test and the proportion who answered correctly was higher among non-Hispanic white women. Women who have been vaccinated for HPV are more likely to have been screened for cervical cancer. These results suggest areas for more robust studies examining pro-health attitudes, behaviors, and communication regarding vaccination and preventive screening.

AB  - PurposeThis study sought to assess whether risky sexual behaviors and sexual exploitation of orphaned adolescents differed between family-based and institutional care environments in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya.MethodsWe analyzed baseline data from a cohort of orphaned adolescents aged 10–18 years living in 300 randomly selected households and 19 charitable children's institutions. The primary outcomes were having ever had consensual sex, number of sex partners, transactional sex, and forced sex. Multivariate logistic regression compared these between participants in institutional care and family-based care while adjusting for age, sex, orphan status, importance of religion, caregiver support and supervision, school attendance, and alcohol and drug use.ResultsThis analysis included 1,365 participants aged ≥10 years: 712 (52%) living in institutional environments and 653 (48%) in family-based care. Participants in institutional care were significantly less likely to report engaging in transactional sex (adjusted odds ratio, .46; 95% confidence interval, .3–.72) or to have experienced forced sex (adjusted odds ratio, .57; 95% confidence interval, .38–.88) when controlling for age, sex, and orphan status. These associations remained when adjusting for additional variables.ConclusionsOrphaned adolescents living in family-based care in Uasin Gishu, Kenya, may be at increased risk of transactional sex and sexual violence compared to those in institutional care. Institutional care may reduce vulnerabilities through the provision of basic material needs and adequate standards of living that influence adolescents' sexual risk-taking behaviors. The use of single items to assess outcomes and nonexplicit definition of sex suggest the findings should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Objectives To describe differences in hospice services for patients living at home, in nursing homes or in assisted living facilities, including the overall number and duration of visits by different hospice care providers across varying lengths of stay. Design Retrospective cohort study using hospice patient electronic medical record data. Setting Large, national hospice provider. Participants Data from 32,605 hospice patients who received routine hospice care from 2009 to 2014 were analyzed. Measurements Descriptive statistics were calculated for utilization measures for each type of provider and by location of care. Frequency and duration of service contacts were standardized to a 1 week period and pairwise comparisons were used to detect differences in care provided between the three settings. Results Minimal differences were found in overall intensity of service contacts across settings, however, the mix of services were different for patients living at home versus nursing home versus assisted living facility. Overall, more nurse care was provided at the beginning and end of the hospice episode; intensity of aide care services was higher in the middle portion of the hospice episode. Nearly 43% of the sample had hospice stays less than 2 weeks and up to 20% had stays greater than 6 months. Conclusion There are significant differences between characteristics of hospice patients in different settings, as well as the mix of services they receive. Medicare hospice payment methodology was revised starting in 2016. While the new payment structure is in greater alignment with the U shape distribution of services, it will be important to evaluate the impact of the new payment methodology on length of stay and mix of services by different providers across settings of care.

AB  - Background Screening instruments for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as used routinely to guide clinicians regarding patient referral for polysomnography (PSG), rely heavily on symptomatology. We sought to develop and validate a cerebrovascular disease-specific OSA prediction model less reliant on symptomatology, and to compare its performance with commonly used screening instruments within a population with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods Using data on demographic factors, anthropometric measurements, medical history, stroke severity, sleep questionnaires, and PSG from 2 independently derived, multisite, randomized trials that enrolled patients with stroke or TIA, we developed and validated a model to predict the presence of OSA (i.e., Apnea-Hypopnea Index ≥5 events per hour). Model performance was compared with that of the Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index, Age, Neck circumference, and Gender instrument, and the Sleep Apnea Clinical Score. Results The new SLEEP Inventory (Sex, Left heart failure, ESS, Enlarged neck, weight [in Pounds], Insulin resistance/diabetes, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) performed modestly better than other instruments in identifying patients with OSA, showing reasonable discrimination in the development (c-statistic .732) and validation (c-statistic .731) study populations, and having the highest negative predictive value of all in struments. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware of these limitations in OSA screening instruments when making decisions about referral for PSG. The high negative predictive value of the SLEEP INventory may be useful in determining and prioritizing patients with stroke or TIA least in need of overnight PSG.

AB  - Disablement affects over 40% of patients with advanced stage cancer, devastates their quality of life (QoL), and increases their healthcare costs. Proactively treating the causes of disablement; physical impairments, pain, and immobility, can prolong functional independence, improve QoL and, potentially, reduce utilization. However rehabilitation service delivery models are reactive in nature and focus on catastrophic rather than incipient disability. A validated collaborative approach, the Three Component Model (TCM), optimizes important clinical outcomes and may provide an ideal framework to overcome barriers to proactively integrating rehabilitation into cancer care. A novel expansion of the TCM that targets disablement by engaging local physical therapists to address physical impairments and immobility, the TCM-Rehabilitation Services (TCM-RS), benefits and is well received by patients. However, its effectiveness has not been rigorously assessed. The 3-arm randomized COllaborative Care to Preserve PErformance in Cancer (COPE) Trial compared: 1) enhanced usual care, 2) rehabilitation services targeting physical impairments and immobility via the TCM-RS, and 3) TCM-RS plus conventional TCM pain management TCM-RS + Pain. Of the 516 participants, those randomized to arms 2 and 3 underwent an initial 4-week intervention period and were then followed for 6 months with remote monitoring and monthly telephone calls. The trial's primary outcome, functional status, and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Utilization was abstracted from clinical records. By estimating the effectiveness and cost-utility implications of the TCM-RS and TCM-RS + Pain, COPE will inform future delivery research, practice and policy in the means to reduce disablement in chronically diseased populations.

AB  - This manuscript describes the study protocol, recruitment outcomes, and baseline participant characteristics for the Strategies for Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness (SPACE) trial. SPACE is a pragmatic randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted in multiple VA primary care clinics within one VA health care system. The objective was to compare benefits and harms of opioid therapy versus non-opioid medication therapy over 12 months among patients with moderate-to-severe chronic back pain or hip/knee osteoarthritis pain despite analgesic therapy; patients already receiving regular opioid therapy were excluded. Key design features include comparing two clinically-relevant medication interventions, pragmatic eligibility criteria, and flexible treat-to-target interventions. Screening, recruitment and study enrollment were conducted over 31 months. A total of 4491 patients were contacted for eligibility screening; 53.1% were ineligible, 41.0% refused, and 5.9% enrolled. The most common reasons for ineligibility were not meeting pain location and severity criteria. The most common study-specific reasons for refusal were preference for no opioid use and preference for no pain medications. Of 265 enrolled patients, 25 withdrew before randomization. Of 240 randomized patients, 87.9% were male, 84.1% were white, and age range was 21–80 years. Past-year mental health diagnoses were 28.3% depression, 17% anxiety, 9.4% PTSD, 7.9% alcohol use disorder, and 2.6% drug use disorder. In conclusion, although recruitment for this trial was challenging, characteristics of enrolled participants suggest we were successful in recruiting patients similar to those prescribed opioid therapy in usual care.

AB  - Abstract Background The College of American Pathologists (CAP) introduced the first cancer synoptic reporting protocols in 1998. However, the objective of a fully computable and machine-readable cancer synoptic report remains elusive due to insufficient definitional content in Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). To address this terminology gap, investigators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) are developing, authoring, and testing a SNOMED CT observable ontology to represent the data elements identified by the synoptic worksheets of CAP. Methods Investigators along with collaborators from the US National Library of Medicine, CAP, the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, and the UK Health and Social Care Information Centre analyzed and assessed required data elements for colorectal cancer and invasive breast cancer synoptic reporting. SNOMED CT concept expressions were developed at UNMC in the Nebraska Lexicon© SNOMED CT namespace. LOINC codes for each SNOMED CT expression were issued by the Regenstrief Institute. SNOMED CT concepts represented observation answer value sets. Results UNMC investigators created a total of 194 SNOMED CT observable entity concept definitions to represent required data elements for CAP colorectal and breast cancer synoptic worksheets, including biomarkers. Concepts were bound to colorectal and invasive breast cancer reports in the UNMC pathology system and successfully used to populate a UNMC biobank. Discussion The absence of a robust observables ontology represents a barrier to data capture and reuse in clinical areas founded upon observational information. Terminology developed in this project establishes the model to characterize pathology data for information exchange, public health, and research analytics.

AB  - The workforce available to care for older adults has not kept pace with the need. In response to workforce limitations and the growing complexity of healthcare, scientists have tested new models of care that redesign clinical practice. This article describes why new models of care in aging, dementia, and mental health diffuse inadequately into the healthcare systems and communities where they might benefit older adults. We review a general framework for the diffusion of innovations and highlight the importance of other features of innovations that deter or facilitate diffusion. Although scientists often focus on generating evidence‐based innovations, end‐users apply their own criteria to determine an innovation's value. In 1962, Rogers suggested six features of an innovation that facilitate or deter diffusion suggested: relative advantage, compatibility with the existing environment, ease or difficulty of implementation, trial‐ability or ability to “test drive”, adaptability, and observed effectiveness. We describe examples of models of care in aging, dementia and mental health that enjoy a modicum of diffusion into practice and place the features of these models in the context of deterrents and facilitators for diffusion. Developers of models of care in aging, dementia, and mental health typically fail to incorporate the complexities of health systems, the barriers to diffusion, and the role of emotion into design considerations of new models. We describe agile implementation as a strategy to facilitate the speed and scale of diffusion in the setting of complex adaptive systems, social networks, and dynamic macroenvironments.

AB  - During medical referrals, communication barriers between referring and consulting outpatient clinics delay patients’ access to health care. One notable opportunity for reducing these barriers is improved usefulness and usability of electronic medical consultation order forms. The cognitive systems engineering (CSE) design approach focuses on supporting humans in managing cognitive complexity in sociotechnical systems. Cognitive complexity includes communication, decision-making, problem solving, and planning. The objective of this research was to implement a CSE design approach to develop a template that supports the cognitive needs of referring clinicians and improves referral communication. We conducted interviews and observations with primary care providers and specialists at two major tertiary, urban medical facilities. Using qualitative analysis, we identified cognitive requirements and design guidelines. Next, we designed user interface (UI) prototypes and compared their usability with that of a currently implemented UI at a major Midwestern medical facility. Physicians’ cognitive challenges were summarized in four cognitive requirements and 13 design guidelines. As a result, two UI prototypes were developed to support order template search and completion. To compare UIs, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a consultation ordering simulation complemented with the think-aloud elicitation method. Oral comments about the UIs were coded for both content and valence (i.e., positive, neutral, or negative). Across 619 comments, the odds ratio for the UI prototype to elicit higher-valenced comments than the implemented UI was 13.5 (95% CI = [9.2, 19.8]), p < .001. This study reinforced the significance of applying a CSE design approach to inform the design of health information technology. In addition, knowledge elicitation methods enabled identification of physicians’ cognitive requirements and challenges when completing electronic medical consultation orders. The resultant knowledge was used to derive design guidelines and UI prototypes that were more useful and usable for referring physicians. Our results support the implementation of a CSE design approach for electronic medical consultation orders.

AB  - Abstract Background: This statewide survey examined differences in cancer-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors between racial and socioeconomic groups in select counties in Indiana. Methods: A stratified random sample of 7,979 people aged 18–75 who lived in one of 34 Indiana counties with higher cancer mortality rates than the state average, and were seen at least once in the past year in a statewide health system were mailed surveys. Results: Completed surveys were returned by 970 participants, yielding a 12% response rate. Black respondents were less likely to perceive they were at risk for cancer and less worried about getting cancer. Individuals most likely to perceive that they were unlikely to get cancer were more often black, with low incomes (less than $20,000) or high incomes ($50,000 or more), or less than a high school degree. Black women were greater than six times more likely to be adherent to cervical cancer screening. Higher income was associated with receiving a sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years and a lung scan in the past year. Those with the highest incomes were more likely to engage in physical activity. Both income and education were inversely related to smoking. Conclusions: Socioeconomic and racial disparities were observed in health behaviors and receipt of cancer screening. Black individuals had less worry about cancer. Impact: Understanding populations for whom cancer disparities exist and geographic areas where the cancer burden is disproportionately high is essential to decision-making about research priorities and the use of public health resources.

AB  - Abstract Objective In the context of patient broad consent for future research uses of their identifiable health record data, we compare the effectiveness of interactive trust-enhanced e-consent, interactive-only e-consent, and standard e-consent (no interactivity, no trust enhancement). Materials and Methods A randomized trial was conducted involving adult participants making a scheduled primary care visit. Participants were randomized into 1 of the 3 e-consent conditions. Primary outcomes were patient-reported satisfaction with and subjective understanding of the e-consent. Secondary outcomes were objective knowledge, perceived voluntariness, trust in medical researchers, consent decision, and time spent using the application. Outcomes were assessed immediately after use of the e-consent and at 1-week follow-up. Results Across all conditions, participants (N = 734) reported moderate-to-high satisfaction with consent (mean 4.3 of 5) and subjective understanding (79.1 of 100). Over 94% agreed to share their health record data. No statistically significant differences in outcomes were observed between conditions. Irrespective of condition, black participants and those with lower education reported lower satisfaction, subjective understanding, knowledge, perceived voluntariness, and trust in medical researchers, as well as spent more time consenting. Conclusions A large majority of patients were willing to share their identifiable health records for research, and they reported positive consent experiences. However, incorporating optional additional information and messages designed to enhance trust in the research process did not improve consent experiences. To improve poorer consent experiences of racial and ethnic minority participants and those with lower education, other novel consent technologies and processes may be valuable.

AB  - Objective: Hypoglycemia occurs in 20–60% of patients with diabetes mellitus. Identifying at-risk patients can facilitate interventions to lower risk. We sought to develop a hypoglycemia prediction model.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, urban adults prescribed a diabetes drug between 2004 and 2013 were identified. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from an electronic medical record (EMR). Laboratory tests, diagnostic codes and natural language processing (NLP) identified hypoglycemia. We compared multiple logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest. Models were evaluated on an independent test set or through cross-validation.Results: The 38,780 patients had mean age 57 years; 56% were female, 40% African-American and 39% uninsured. Hypoglycemia occurred in 8128 (539 identified only by NLP). In logistic regression, factors positively associated with hypoglycemia included infection, non-long-acting insulin, dementia and recent hypoglycemia. Negatively associated factors included long-acting insulin plus sulfonylurea, and age 75 or older. The models’ area under curve was similar (logistic regression, 89%; CART, 88%; random forest, 90%, with ten-fold cross-validation).Conclusions: NLP improved identification of hypoglycemia. Non-long-acting insulin was an important risk factor. Decreased risk with age may reflect treatment or diminished awareness of hypoglycemia. More complex models did not improve prediction.

AB  - Transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients are at high risk of recurrent vascular events; timely management can reduce that risk by 70%. The Protocol-guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurological Symptoms (PREVENT) developed, implemented, and evaluated a TIA quality improvement (QI) intervention aligned with Learning Healthcare System principles.This stepped-wedge trial developed, implemented and evaluated a provider-facing, multi-component intervention to improve TIA care at six facilities. The unit of analysis was the medical center. The intervention was developed based on benchmarking data, staff interviews, literature, and electronic quality measures and included: performance data, clinical protocols, professional education, electronic health record tools, and QI support. The effectiveness outcome was the without-fail rate: the proportion of patients who receive all processes of care for which they are eligible among seven processes. The implementation outcomes were the number of implementation activities completed and final team organization level. The intervention effects on the without-fail rate were analyzed using generalized mixed-effects models with multilevel hierarchical random effects. Mixed methods were used to assess implementation, user satisfaction, and sustainability.PREVENT advanced three aspects of a Learning Healthcare System. Learning from Data: teams examined and interacted with their performance data to explore hypotheses, plan QI activities, and evaluate change over time. Learning from Each Other: Teams participated in monthly virtual collaborative calls. Sharing Best Practices: Teams shared tools and best practices. The approach used to design and implement PREVENT may be generalizable to other clinical conditions where time-sensitive care spans clinical settings and medical disciplines.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02769338 [May 11, 2016].

AB  - Abstract Objectives The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting clinical research using electronic dental record (EDR) data from U.S. solo and small-group general dental practices in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network (network) and evaluate the data completeness and correctness before performing survival analyses of root canal treatment (RCT) and posterior composite restorations (PCR). Methods Ninety-nine network general dentistry practices that used Dentrix or EagleSoft EDR shared de-identified data of patients who received PCR and/or RCT on permanent teeth through October 31, 2015. We evaluated the data completeness and correctness, summarized practice, and patient characteristics and summarized the two treatments by tooth type and arch location. Results Eighty-two percent of practitioners were male, with a mean age of 49 and 22.4 years of clinical experience. The final dataset comprised 217,887 patients and 11,289,594 observations, with the observation period ranging from 0 to 37 years. Most patients (73%) were 18 to 64 years old; 56% were female. The data were nearly 100% complete. Eight percent of observations had incorrect data, such as incorrect tooth number or surface, primary teeth, supernumerary teeth, and tooth ranges, indicating multitooth procedures instead of PCR or RCT. Seventy-three percent of patients had dental insurance information; 27% lacked any insurance information. While gender was documented for all patients, race/ethnicity was missing in the dataset. Conclusion This study established the feasibility of using EDR data integrated from multiple distinct solo and small-group network practices for longitudinal studies to assess treatment outcomes. The results laid the groundwork for a learning health system that enables practitioners to learn about their patients' outcomes by using data from their own practice.

AB  - Utilization rates (URs) for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (PPSCD) are lacking in the community.The purpose of this study was to establish the ICD UR in central Indiana.A query run on 2 hospitals in a health information exchange database in Indianapolis identified patients between 2011 and 2012 with left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤0.35. ICD eligibility and utilization were determined from chart review.We identified 1863 patients with at least 1 low EF study. Two cohorts were analyzed: 1672 patients without and 191 patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure code 37.94 for ICD placement. We manually reviewed a stratified (by hospital) random sample of 300 patients from the no-ICD procedure code cohort and found that 48 (16%) had no ICD but had class I indications for ICD. Eight of 300 (2.7%) actually had ICD implantation for PPSCD. Review of all 191 patients in the ICD procedure code cohort identified 70 with ICD implantation for PPSCD. The ICD UR (ratio between patients with ICD for PPSCD and all with indication) was 38% overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 28%-49%). URs were 48% for males (95% CI 34%-61%), 21% for females (95% CI 16%-26%, P = .0002 vs males), 40% for whites (95% CI 27%-53%), and 37% for blacks (95% CI 28%-46%, P = .66 vs whites).ICD UR is 38% among patients meeting class I indications, suggesting further opportunities for improving guideline compliance. This study also illustrates limitations in calculating ICD UR using large electronic repositories without hands-on chart review.

AB  - Parenting is increasingly recognized as an upstream, near-universal determinant of social, economic, and health outcomes. Pediatricians know that effective parenting can buffer many adverse childhood events, thereby decreasing toxic stress and improving health. Unlike many other determinants of health, parenting behaviors are modifiable.1 The upstream and modifiable nature of parenting combine to make it an effective, although underused, lever of pediatric outcomes.2

Increasing interest in supporting effective parenting behaviors as a means to improve pediatric health is being reflected in a growing array of professional and policy initiatives. Professionals in nursing, psychology, education, and social work have developed multiple interventions aimed at improving parenting behaviors and affecting child outcomes.3 Not to be outdone, physicians have worked to develop clinically relevant interventions, adapting other models and creating novel approaches.4,5 On the policy front, there is advocacy at the highest levels. For example, the Affordable Care Act of 2010, Section 2951, calls for and funds a home-visiting program, modeled after the Nurse-Family Partnership6; one of the metrics of success for this program is “improved parenting skills.”

Supporting positive and effective parenting behaviors is vital, but there is one key caveat; the recommending, planning, and funding of parenting behavior interventions must occur with the guidance of assessment. Parenting behaviors are not currently assessed on either an individual or a population level, making it difficult to direct intervention. Although supporting positive and effective parenting behaviors should be a high priority for individual pediatricians, professional societies, and federal policymakers, instituting broad-based interventions without proper assessment is bad policy.

Pediatricians are already invested in parenting behaviors. In the primary care setting, pediatricians are expected to …

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the effect of cognitive impairment on rehospitalization in older adults. Design One‐year longitudinal study. Setting Medical service of an urban, 340‐bed public hospital in Indianapolis between July 2006 and March 2008. Participants Individuals aged 65 and older admitted to the medical service (N = 976). Measurements Rehospitalization was defined as any hospital admission after the index admission. Participant demographics, discharge destination, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Acute Physiology Score, and prior hospitalizations were measured as the confounders. Participants were considered to have cognitive impairment if they had two or more errors on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Results After adjusting for confounders, a significant interaction between cognitive impairment and discharge location was found to predict rehospitalization rate ( P = .008) and time to 1‐year rehospitalization ( P = .03). Participants with cognitive impairment discharged to a facility had a longer time to rehospitalization (median 142 days) than participants with no cognitive impairment (median 98 days) (hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.58–1.02, P = .07), whereas participants with cognitive impairment discharged to home had a slightly shorter time to rehospitalization (median 182 days) than those without cognitive impairment (median 224 days) ( HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.92–1.43, P = .23). These two nonsignificant HR s in opposite directions were significantly different from each other ( P = .03). Conclusion Discharge destination modifies the association between cognitive impairment and rehospitalization. Of participants discharged to a facility, those without cognitive impairment had higher rehospitalization rates, whereas the rates were similar between cognitively impaired and intact participants discharged to the community.

Virtually every nursing home patient is an appropriate candidate for palliative care. The IOM report makes 5 key recommendations that offer guidance for improving the delivery and outcomes of EOL care (see Table 1).

AB  - In Brief Objective: To characterize public health workers who specialize in informatics and to assess informatics-related aspects of the work performed by the public health workforce. Methods (Design, Setting, Participants): Using the nationally representative Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS), we characterized and compared responses from informatics, information technology (IT), clinical and laboratory, and other public health science specialists working in state health agencies. Main Outcome Measures: Demographics, income, education, and agency size were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Weighted medians and interquartile ranges were calculated for responses pertaining to job satisfaction, workplace environment, training needs, and informatics-related competencies. Results: Of 10 246 state health workers, we identified 137 (1.3%) informatics specialists and 419 (4.1%) IT specialists. Overall, informatics specialists are younger, but share many common traits with other public health science roles, including positive attitudes toward their contributions to the mission of public health as well as job satisfaction. Informatics specialists differ demographically from IT specialists, and the 2 groups also differ with respect to salary as well as their distribution across agencies of varying size. All groups identified unmet public health and informatics competency needs, particularly limited training necessary to fully utilize technology for their work. Moreover, all groups indicated a need for greater future emphasis on leveraging electronic health information for public health functions. Conclusions: Findings from the PH WINS establish a framework and baseline measurements that can be leveraged to routinely monitor and evaluate the ineludible expansion and maturation of the public health informatics workforce and can also support assessment of the growth and evolution of informatics training needs for the broader field. Ultimately, such routine evaluations have the potential to guide local and national informatics workforce development policy. The articles uses PH WINS to characterize and compare responses from informatics, information technology, clinical and laboratory, and other public health science specialists working in state health agencies.

AB  - Advances in intensive care unit bedside displays/interfaces and electronic medical record (EMR) technology have not adequately addressed the topic of visual clarity of patient data/information to further reduce cognitive load during clinical decision-making. We responded to these challenges with a human-centered approach to designing and testing a decision-support tool: MIVA 2.0 (Medical Information Visualization Assistant, v.2). Envisioned as an EMR visualization dashboard to support rapid analysis of real-time clinical data-trends, our primary goal originated from a clinical requirement to reduce cognitive overload. In the study, a convenience sample of 12 participants were recruited, in which quantitative and qualitative measures were used to compare MIVA 2.0 with ICU paper medical-charts, using time-on-task, post-test questionnaires, and interviews. Findings demonstrated a significant difference in speed and accuracy with the use of MIVA 2.0. Qualitative outcomes concurred, with participants acknowledging the potential impact of MIVA 2.0 for reducing cognitive load and enabling more accurate and quicker decision-making.

AB  - Background: Use of MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can identify infarcts in 30%–50% of patients with TIA. Previous guidelines have indicated that MRI-DWI is the preferred imaging modality for patients with TIA. We assessed the frequency of MRI utilization and predictors of MRI performance. Methods: A review of TIA and minor stroke patients evaluated at Veterans Affairs hospitals was conducted with regard to medical history, use of diagnostic imaging within 2 days of presentation, and in-hospital care variables. Chart abstraction was performed in a subset of hospitals to assess clinical variables not available in the administrative data. Results: A total of 7,889 patients with TIA/minor stroke were included. Overall, 6,694 patients (84.9%) had CT or MRI, with 3,396/6,694 (50.7%) having MRI. Variables that were associated with increased odds of CT performance were age &gt;80 years, prior stroke, history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary artery disease, anxiety, and low hospital complexity, while blood pressure &gt;140/90 mm Hg and high hospital complexity were associated with increased likelihood of MRI. Diplopia (87% had MRI, p = 0.03), neurologic consultation on the day of presentation (73% had MRI, p &lt; 0.0001), and symptom duration of &gt;6 hours (74% had MRI, p = 0.0009) were associated with MRI performance. Conclusions: Within a national health system, about 40% of patients with TIA/minor stroke had MRI performed within 2 days. Performance of MRI appeared to be influenced by several patient and facility-level variables, suggesting that there has been partial acceptance of the previous guideline that endorsed MRI for patients with TIA.

AB  - Loneliness is a known risk factor for poor mental and physical health outcomes and quality of life in the general population, and preliminary research suggests that loneliness is linked to poorer health outcomes in cancer patients as well. Various aspects of the cancer experience contribute to patients feeling alone and misunderstood. Furthermore, loneliness theory suggests that negative social expectations, which may specifically relate to the cancer experience, precipitate and sustain loneliness. Cancer-specific tools are needed to assess key constructs of this theory. In the current study, we developed and tested measures of (1) loneliness attributed to cancer (i.e., cancer-related loneliness) and (2) negative social expectations related to cancer. First, we developed the items for the measures based on theory, prior research, and expert feedback. Next, we assessed the measures’ psychometric properties (i.e., internal consistency and construct validity) in a diverse sample of cancer patients. The final products included a 7-item unidimensional Cancer Loneliness Scale and a 5-item unidimensional Cancer-related Negative Social Expectations Scale. Evidence of excellent reliability and validity was found for both measures. The resulting measures have both clinical and research utility.

AB  - We compared access to preventive dental care among low-income children eligible for public dental insurance to access among children with private dental insurance and/or high family income (>400% of the federal poverty level) in Georgia, and the effect of policies toward increasing access to dental care for low-income children.We used multiple sources of data (eg, US Census, Georgia Board of Dentistry) to estimate, by census tract, measures of preventive dental care access in 2015 for children aged 0 to 18 years. Measures were percentage of met need, 1-way travel distance to a dentist, and scarcity of dentists. We used an optimization model to estimate access, quantify disparities, and evaluate policies.About 1.5 million children were eligible for public insurance; 600,000 had private insurance and/or high family income. Across census tracts, average met need was 59% for low-income children and 96% for high-income children; for rural census tracts, these values were 33% and 84%, respectively. The average 1-way travel distance for all census tracts was 3.7 miles for high-income and/or privately insured children and 17.2 miles for low-income children; for rural census tracts, these values were 11.6 and 32.9 miles, respectively. Increasing dentists' acceptance of public insurance-eligible children increased met need more in rural areas than in urban areas. To achieve 100% met need in rural tracts, however, an 80% participation rate among dentists would be required.Across census tracts, high-income children had better access to preventive dental care than low-income children had. Identifying tracts with disparities in access could result in more efficient allocation of public health dental resources.

AB  - Many hospitalized older adults require family surrogates to make decisions, but surrogates may perceive that the quality of medical decisions is low and may have poor psychological outcomes after the patient’s hospitalization. To determine the relationship between communication quality and high-quality medical decisions, psychological well-being, and satisfaction for surrogates of hospitalized older adults. Observational study at three hospitals in a Midwest metropolitan area. Hospitalized older adults (65+ years) admitted to medicine and medical intensive care units who were unable to make medical decisions, and their family surrogates. Among 799 eligible dyads, 364 (45.6%) completed the study. Communication was assessed during hospitalization using the information and emotional support subscales of the Family Inpatient Communication Survey. Decision quality was assessed with the Decisional Conflict Scale. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 4–6 weeks post-discharge included anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), and satisfaction (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems). The mean patient age was 81.9 years (SD 8.32); 62% were women, and 28% African American. Among surrogates, 67% were adult children. Six to eight weeks post-discharge, 22.6% of surrogates reported anxiety (11.3% moderate–severe anxiety); 29% reported depression, (14.0% moderate–severe), and 14.6% had high levels of post-traumatic stress. Emotional support was associated with lower odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.65, 95% CI 0.50, 0.85) and depression (AOR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.65, 0.99) at follow-up. In multivariable linear regression, emotional support was associated with lower post-traumatic stress (β = −0.30, p = 0.003) and higher decision quality (β = −0.44, p < 0.0001). Information was associated with higher post-traumatic stress (β = 0.23, p = 0.022) but also higher satisfaction (β = 0.61, p < 0.001). Emotional support of hospital surrogates is consistently associated with better psychological outcomes and decision quality, suggesting an opportunity to improve decision making and well-being.

AB  - Objective To describe antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and associated factors for a large HIV-infected pediatric cohort followed by sites of the East Africa International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium. Methods This study utilized prospectively collected clinical data from HIV-infected children less than 13 years of age who initiated ART within 4 clinical care programs (with 26 clinical sites) in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania and were followed for up to 6 years. Programs used one of 3 adherence measures, including 7-day quantitative recall, 7-day categorical recall, and clinician pill assessments. We fit a hierarchical, three-level, logistic-regression model to examine adherence, with observations nested within patient, and patients within the 26 sites providing pediatric HIV data to this analysis. Results In East Africa, 3,304 children, 52.0% male, were enrolled in care and were subsequently observed for a median of 92 weeks (inter-quartile range [IQR] 50.3–145.0 weeks). Median age at ART initiation was 5.5 years ([IQR] 3.0–8.5 years). “Good” adherence, as reported by each clinic’s measures, was extremely high, remaining on average above 90% throughout all years of follow-up. Longer time on ART was associated with higher adherence (adjusted Odds Ratio–aOR–per log-transformed week on ART: 1.095, 95% Confidence Interval–CI–[1.052–1.150].) Patients enrolled in higher-volume programs exhibited higher rates of clinician-assessed adherence (aOR per log-500 patients: 1.174, 95% CI [1.108–1.245]). Significant site-level variability in reported adherence was observed (0.28), with even higher variability among patients (0.71). In a sub-analysis, being an orphan at the start of ART was strongly associated with lower ART adherence rates (aOR: 0.919, 95% CI [0.864–0.976]). Conclusions Self-reported adherence remained high over a median of 1.8 years in HIV care, but varied according to patient-level and site-level factors. Consistent adherence monitoring with validated measures and attention to vulnerable groups is recommended.

AB  - Street-connected young people carry a disproportionate burden of morbidities, and engage in a variety of practices that may heighten their risk of premature mortality, yet there are currently no reports in the literature on the rates or risk factors for mortality among them, nor on their causes of death. In low- and middle-income countries they are frequently in situations that violate their human rights, likely contributing to their increased burden of morbidities and vulnerability to mortality. We thus sought to describe the number of deaths annually, causes of death, and determine the number of deaths attributable to HIV among street-connected young people aged 0 to 30 years in Eldoret, Kenya.Eldoret, Kenya has approximately 1900 street-connected young people. We collected data on deaths occurring from October 2009 to December 2016 from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital records, Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare HIV program records, and utilized verbal autopsies when no records were available. Descriptive analyses were conducted stratified by sex and age category, and frequencies and proportions were calculated to provide an overview of the decedents. We used logistic regression to assess the association between underlying cause of death and sex, while controlling for age and location of death.In total there were 100-recorded deaths, 66 among males and 34 among females; 37% of were among those aged ≤18 years. HIV/AIDS (37%) was the most common underlying cause of death, followed by assault (36%) and accidents (10%) for all decedents. Among males, the majority of deaths were attributable to assault (49%) and HIV/AIDS (26%), while females primarily died due to HIV/AIDS (59%).Our results demonstrate a high number of deaths due to assault among males and HIV/AIDS among males and females. Our findings demonstrate the need for studies of HIV prevalence and incidence among this population to characterize the burden of HIV, particularly among young women given the higher number of deaths attributed to HIV/AIDS among them. Most deaths were preventable and require the urgent attention of service providers and policymakers to implement programs and services to prevent premature mortality and uphold children's rights.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Early evaluation and management of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and nonsevere ischemic stroke improves outcomes. <h3>Objective</h3> To identify processes of care associated with reduced risk of death or recurrent stroke among patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study included all patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke at Department of Veterans Affairs emergency department or inpatient settings from October 2010 to September 2011. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model associations of processes of care and without-fail care, defined as receiving all guideline-concordant processes of care for which patients are eligible, with risk of death and recurrent stroke. Data were analyzed from March 2018 to April 2019. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Risk of all-cause mortality and recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days and 1 year was calculated. Overall, 28 processes of care were examined. Without-fail care was assessed for 6 processes: brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, hypertension medication intensification, high- or moderate-potency statin therapy, antithrombotics, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. <h3>Results</h3> Among 8076 patients, the mean (SD) age was 67.8 (11.6) years, 7752 patients (96.0%) were men, 5929 (73.4%) were white, 474 (6.1%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke within 90 days, 793 (10.7%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke within 1 year, 320 (4.0%) died within 90 days, and 814 (10.1%) died within 1 year. Overall, 9 processes were independently associated with lower odds of both 90-day and 1-year mortality after adjustment for multiple comparisons: carotid artery imaging (90-day adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.63; 1-year aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72), antihypertensive medication class (90-day aOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.74; 1-year aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83), lipid measurement (90-day aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; 1-year aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78), lipid management (90-day aOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33-0.65; 1-year aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.85), discharged receiving statin medication (90-day aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73; 1-year aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88), cholesterol-lowering medication intensification (90-day aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.83; 1-year aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.77), antithrombotics by day 2 (90-day aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.79; 1-year aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87) or at discharge (90-day aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.86; 1-year aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88), and neurology consultation (90-day aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87; 1-year aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.87). Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation was associated with lower odds of 1-year mortality only (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.85). No processes were associated with reduced risk of recurrent stroke after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The rate of without-fail care was 15.3%; 1216 patients received all guideline-concordant processes of care for which they were eligible. Without-fail care was associated with a 31.2% lower odds of 1-year mortality (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87) but was not independently associated with stroke risk. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Patients who received 6 readily available processes of care had lower adjusted mortality 1 year after TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke. Clinicians caring for patients with TIA and nonsevere ischemic stroke should seek to ensure that patients receive all guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is common among patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with reduced functional recovery and an increased risk for recurrent vascular events.The Sleep for Stroke Management and Recovery Trial (Sleep SMART) aims to determine whether automatically adjusting continuous positive airway pressure (aCPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea improves clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack.A total of 3062 randomized subjects for the prevention of recurrent serious vascular events, and among these, 1362 stroke survivors for the recovery outcome.Sleep SMART is a phase III, multicenter, prospective randomized, open, blinded outcome event assessed controlled trial. Adults with recent acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack and no contraindication to aCPAP are screened for obstructive sleep apnea with a portable sleep apnea test. Subjects with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea but without predominant central sleep apnea proceed to a run-in night of aCPAP. Subjects with use (≥4 h) of aCPAP and without development of significant central apneas are randomized to aCPAP plus usual care or care-as-usual for six months. Telemedicine is used to monitor and facilitate aCPAP adherence remotely.Two separate primary outcomes: (1) the composite of recurrent acute ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality (prevention) and (2) the modified Rankin scale scores (recovery) at six- and three-month post-randomization, respectively.Sleep SMART represents the first large trial to test whether aCPAP for obstructive sleep apnea after stroke/transient ischemic attack reduces recurrent vascular events or death, and improves functional recovery.

AB  - Background: Palliative care (PC) and hospice care are underutilized for patients with end-stage liver disease, but factors associated with these patterns of utilization are not well understood. Objective: We examined patient-level factors associated with both PC and hospice referrals in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with DC hospitalized at a single tertiary center and followed for one year. Measurements: We assessed PC and hospice referrals during follow-up and examined patient-level factors associated with the receipt of PC and/or hospice, as well as associated clinical outcomes. We also examined late referrals (within one week of death). Results: Of 397 patients, 61 (15.4%) were referred to PC, 71 (17.9%) were referred to hospice, and 99 (24.9%) were referred to PC and/or hospice. Two hundred patients (50.4%) died during the one-year follow-up. In multivariable logistic regression, referral to PC was associated with increased comorbidity burden, ascites, increased MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease)-Na score, lack of listing for liver transplant, and unmarried status. Hospice referral was associated with increased comorbidities, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. PC referrals were late in 68.5% of cases, and hospice referrals were late in 62.7%. Late PC referrals were associated with younger age and married status. Late hospice referrals were associated with younger age and recent alcohol use. Conclusions: PC and hospice is underutilized in patients with DC, and most referrals are late. Patient-level factors associated with these referrals differ between PC and hospice.

AB  - Rationale: Delirium severity and duration are independently associated with higher mortality and morbidity. No studies to date have described a delirium trajectory by integrating both severity and duration.Objectives: The primary aim was to develop delirium trajectories by integrating symptom severity and duration. The secondary aim was to investigate the association among trajectory membership, clinical characteristics, and 30-day mortality.Methods: A secondary analysis of the PMD (Pharmacologic Management of Delirium) randomized control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00842608; N = 531) was conducted. The presence of delirium and symptom severity were measured at least daily for 7 days using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and CAM-ICU-7 (on a scale of 0–7, with 7 being the most severe). Delirium trajectories were defined using an innovative, data-driven statistical method (group-based trajectory modeling [GBTM]) and SAS v9.4.Results: A total of 531 delirious participants (mean age 60 yr [standard deviation = 16], 55% female, and 46% African American) were analyzed. Five distinct delirium trajectories were described (CAM-ICU-7: mean [standard deviation]); mild-brief (CAM-ICU-7: 0.5 [0.5]), severe-rapid recovers (CAM-ICU-7: 2.1 [1.0]), mild-accelerating (CAM-ICU-7: 2.2 [0.9]), severe-slow recovers (CAM-ICU-7: 3.9 [0.9]), and severe-nonrecovers (CAM-ICU-7: 5.9 [1.0]). Baseline cognition and race were associated with trajectory membership. Trajectory membership independently predicted 30-day mortality while controlling for age, sex, race, cognition, illness severity, and comorbidities.Conclusions: This secondary analysis described five distinct delirium trajectories based on delirium symptom severity and duration using group-based trajectory modeling. Trajectory membership predicted 30-day mortality.

AB  - Completion of an advance care planning (ACP) process and/or an advance directive should result in patients receiving the care they desire at the end of life. However, three decades of research have shown that is just not the case. ACP has been a front runner in developing the science within palliative care. Some positive outcomes such as lowering levels of surrogate grief may be associated with ACP. Yet, it does not appear that further ACP research will ensure that seriously ill patients will get goal-concordant care. An unfortunate consequence of palliative care research and advocacy so far is the misguided notion of many hospital systems trying to solve their palliative care problems by only implementing an ACP initiative. At best, ACP is but one tool in the collective palliative care toolbox. New tools are needed. Given that we have finite resources, future research should focus more on tools to improve symptom management, better models of care, and systems that will ensure goal-concordant care that meet the needs of the population that the health care system is designed to meet.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that poor cognition and low body mass index were associated with increased mortality. But few studies have investigated the association between cognition and mortality across the entire cognitive spectrum while adjusting for BMI. The objective of this study is to examine the associations between cognitive function, BMI and 7-year mortality in a rural elderly Chinese cohort.A prospective cohort of 2,000 Chinese age 65 and over from four rural counties in China were followed for 7-years. Cognitive function, BMI and other covariate information were obtained at baseline. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to determine the effects of cognitive function and BMI on mortality risk.Of participants enrolled, 473 (23.7%) died during follow-up. Both lower cognitive function (HR = 1.48, p = 0.0049) and lower BMI (HR = 1.6, p < 0.0001) were independently associated with increased mortality risk compared to individuals with average cognitive function and normal weight. Higher cognitive function was associated with lower mortality risk (HR = 0.69, p = 0.0312). We found no significant difference in mortality risk between overweight/obese participants and those with normal weight.Cognitive function and BMI were independent predictors of mortality risk. Intervention strategies for increasing cognitive function and maintaining adequate BMI may be important in reducing morality risk in the elderly population.

AB  - This study examined outcomes for intensive residential and outpatient/community-based post-inpatient brain injury rehabilitation (PBIR) programs compared with supported living programs. The goal of supported living programs was stable functioning (no change). Data were obtained for a large cohort of adults with acquired brain injury (ABI) from the OutcomeInfo national database, a web-based database system developed through National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding for monitoring progress and outcomes in PBIR programs primarily with the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4). Rasch-derived MPAI-4 measures for cases from 2008 to 2014 from 9 provider organizations offering programs in 23 facilities throughout the United States were examined. Controlling for age at injury, time in program, and time since injury on admission (chronicity), both intensive residential (n = 205) and outpatient/community-based (n = 2781) programs resulted in significant (approximately 1 standard deviation [SD]) functional improvement on the MPAI-4 Total Score compared with supported living (n = 101) programs (F = 18.184, p < 0.001). Intensive outpatient/community-based programs showed greater improvements on MPAI-4 Ability (F = 14.135, p < 0.001), Adjustment (F = 12.939, p < 0.001), and Participation (F = 16.679, p < 0.001) indices than supported living programs; whereas, intensive residential programs showed improvement primarily in Adjustment and Participation. Age at injury and time in program had small effects on outcome; the effect of chronicity was small to moderate. Examination of more chronic cases (>1 year post-injury) showed significant, but smaller (approximately 0.5 SD) change on the MPAI-4 relative to supported living programs (F = 17.562, p < 0.001). Results indicate that intensive residential and outpatient/community-based PIBR programs result in substantial positive functional changes moderated by chronicity.

AB  - Medical students develop clinical reasoning skills throughout their training. The Script Concordance Test (SCT) is a standardized instrument that assesses clinical reasoning; test takers with more clinical experience consistently outperform those with less experience. SCT studies to date have been cross-sectional, with no studies examining same-student longitudinal performance gains.This four-year observational study took place between 2008 and 2011 at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Students in two different cohorts took the same SCT as second-year medical students and then again as fourth-year medical students. The authors matched and analyzed same-student data from the two SCT administrations for the classes of 2011 and 2012. They used descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and paired t tests.Matched data were available for 260 students in the class of 2011 (of 303, 86%) and 264 students in the class of 2012 (of 289, 91%). The mean same-student gain for the class of 2011 was 8.6 (t[259] = 15.9; P < .0001) and for the class of 2012 was 11.3 (t[263] = 21.4; P < .0001). Each cohort gained more than one standard deviation.Medical students made statistically significant gains in their performance on an SCT over a two-year period. These findings demonstrate same-student gains in clinical reasoning over time as measured by the SCT and suggest that the SCT as a standardized instrument can help to evaluate growth in clinical reasoning skills.

AB  - Automated interactive voice response (IVR) call systems can provide systematic monitoring and self-management support to depressed patients, but it is unknown if stroke patients are able and willing to engage in IVR interactions. We sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of IVR as an adjunct to post-stroke depression follow-up care. The CarePartner program is a mobile health program designed to optimize depression self-management, facilitate social support from a caregiver, and strengthen connections between stroke survivors and primary care providers (PCPs). Ischemic stroke patients and an informal caregiver, if available, were recruited during the patient’s acute stroke hospitalization or follow-up appointment. The CarePartner program was activated in patients with depressive symptoms during their stroke hospitalization or follow-up. The 3-month intervention consisted of weekly IVR calls monitoring both depressive symptoms and medication adherence along with tailored suggestions for depressive symptom self-management. After each completed IVR call, informal caregivers were automatically updated, and, if needed, the subject’s PCP was notified. Of the 56 stroke patients who enrolled, depressive symptoms were identified in 13 (23 %) subjects. Subjects completed 74 % of the weekly IVR assessments. A total of six subjects did not complete the outcome assessment, including two non-study-related deaths. PCPs were notified five times, including two times for suicidal ideation and three times for medication non-adherence. Stroke patients with depressive symptoms were able to engage in an IVR call system. Future studies are needed to explore the efficacy of an IVR approach for post-stroke self-management and monitoring of stroke-related outcomes.

AB  - This pilot study was designed to measure teamwork and the relationship of teamwork to patient perceptions of care among 63 members of 12 oncology teams at a Cancer Centre in the Midwest. Lack of teamwork in cancer care can result in serious clinical errors, fragmentation of care, and poor quality of care. Many oncology team members, highly skilled in clinical care, are not trained to work effectively as members of a care team. The research team administered the Relational Coordination survey to core oncology team members—medical oncologists, nurse coordinators, and clinical secretaries—to measure seven dimensions of team skills (four relating to communication [frequency, timeliness, accuracy, and problem solving] and three relating to relationship [shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect]) averaged to create a Relational Coordination Index. The results indicated that among the team member roles, nurse coordinator relational coordination indices were the strongest and most positively correlated with patient perception of care. Statistically significant correlations were intra-nurse coordinator relational coordination indices and two patient perception of care factors (information and education and patient’s preferences). All other nurse coordinator intra-role as well as inter-role correlations were also positively correlated, although not statistically significant.

AB  - Community health workers (CHWs) can engage elderly persons in advance care planning (ACP) conversations. We report how trained CHWs used Go Wish cards (GW R cards) to identify patients’ highest priority preferences and evaluated whether engaging in ACP conversations was associated with subsequent health care utilization. A one-year long, pre-post longitudinal design was used to evaluate our educational intervention using mixed-methods. 392 patients (mean of 73.3 years, 82% women, 48% African American, 43% Caucasian) enrolled in the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program and participated in ACP discussions with CHWs. We expanded the role of the ABC’s CHW, who work directly with individuals and caregivers during home visits to monitor bio-psycho-social needs, to include ACP conversations. The CHWs received ACP training, practice with tools such as GW R cards, and support from an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support tool. Quantitative measures of patients’ ACP preferences and health care utilization were abstracted from the EHR. Qualitative data about patients’ perceptions of CHWs in facilitating ACP discussions was obtained through semi-structured interviews. Eighty-six patients’ data indicated that they had engaged in a preferences-for-care process using GW R cards. The top-three card choices by patients was attending to spirituality and religious concerns, preparing for end of life, and maintaining personal wholeness. CHWs were able to effectively engage in ACP conversations with patients and GW R cards were a positive way to stimulate discussion of issues previously undiscussed.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the long-term (>5 years) health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes following radical cystectomy, comparing Indiana pouch (IP), neobladder (NB), and ileal conduit (IC). Materials and Methods The departmental radical cystectomy database was queried to identify patients who underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for bladder cancer between 1991 and 2009 and had not died. Three hundred patients were identified and sent the validated Bladder Cancer Index instrument. Results A total of 128 (43%) patients completed the survey. When adjusted for gender, age at surgery, surgeon, and time since surgery, IC and IP patients had significantly better urinary function than NB patients (P = .0013). Sexual bother was less in NB than IP (P = .0387). Among men ≥65 years of age, IC patients had significantly better urinary function (P = .0376) than NB patients (91.6 vs 49.4, respectively). Among men <65 years of age, IC and IP patients (76.0 and 82.8, respectively) had significantly better urinary function than NB patients (50.7) (P = .0199). Among women greater than 65 years, bowel bother was significantly better (P = .0095) for IC patients than IP patients (44.8 vs 69.5, respectively). Conclusion Urinary diversion type after radical cystectomy affects HRQOL differently in long-term survivors. Age and gender at surgery influenced HRQOL based on diversion procedure. Urinary function but not urinary bother was significantly better in IC and IP compared to NB diversions. Prospective longitudinal studies using validated HRQOL tools will further help guide preoperative diversion choice decisions between patient and surgeon.

AB  - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) leads to serious health issues and remains the most common sexually transmitted infection. Despite availability of effective vaccines, HPV vaccination rates are suboptimal. Furthermore, providers recommend the HPV vaccine less than half the time for eligible patients. Prior informatics research has demonstrated the effectiveness of computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) in changing provider behavior, especially in the area of preventative services. Following a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a CDS intervention on HPV vaccination rates, we conducted semi-structured interviews with health care providers to understand whether they noticed the CDS reminders and why providers did or did not respond to the prompts. Eighteen providers, a mix of medical doctors and nurse practitioners, were interviewed from five publicly-funded, urban health clinics. Interview data were qualitatively analyzed by two independent researchers using inductive content analysis. While most providers recalled seeing the CDS reminders, few of them perceived the intervention as effective in changing their behavior. Providers stated many reasons for why they did not perceive a change in their behavior, yet the results of the trial showed HPV vaccination rates increased as a result of the intervention. CDS reminders may be effective at changing provider behavior even if providers perceive them to be of little use. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02551887 Registered on September 15, 2015

AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care cascade is a conceptual model used to outline the benchmarks that reflects effectiveness of HIV care in the whole HIV care continuum. The models can be used to identify barriers contributing to poor outcomes along each benchmark in the cascade such as disengagement from care or death. Recently, the HIV care cascade has been widely applied to monitor progress towards HIV prevention and care goals in an attempt to develop strategies to improve health outcomes along the care continuum. Yet, there are challenges in quantifying successes and gaps in HIV care using the cascade models that are partly due to the lack of analytic approaches. The availability of large cohort data presents an opportunity to develop a coherent statistical framework for analysis of the HIV care cascade. Motivated by data from the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare, which has provided HIV care to nearly 200,000 individuals in Western Kenya since 2001, we developed a state transition framework that can characterize patient‐level movements through the multiple stages of the HIV care cascade. We describe how to transform large observational data into an analyzable format. We then illustrate the state transition framework via multistate modeling to quantify dynamics in retention aspects of care. The proposed modeling approach identifies the transition probabilities of moving through each stage in the care cascade. In addition, this approach allows regression‐based estimation to characterize effects of (time‐varying) predictors of within and between state transitions such as retention, disengagement, re‐entry into care, transfer‐out, and mortality.

AB  - Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) is a 2‐phase Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations demonstration project now testing a novel Medicare Part B payment model for nursing facilities and practitioners in 40 Indiana nursing facilities. The new payment codes are intended to promote high‐quality care in place for acutely ill long‐stay residents. The focus of the initiative is to reduce hospitalizations through the diagnosis and on‐site management of 6 common acute clinical conditions (linked to a majority of potentially avoidable hospitalizations of nursing facility residents ): pneumonia, urinary tract infection, skin infection, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and dehydration. This article describes the OPTIMISTIC Phase 2 model design, nursing facility and practitioner recruitment and training, and early experiences implementing new Medicare payment codes for nursing facilities and practitioners. Lessons learned from the OPTIMISTIC experience may be useful to others engaged in multicomponent quality improvement initiatives.

AB  - Problem Despite the more than $32 billion the National Institutes of Health has invested annually, evidence-based health care services are not reliably implemented, sustained, or distributed in health care delivery organizations, resulting in suboptimal care and patient harm. New organizational approaches and frameworks that reflect the complex nature of health care systems are needed to achieve this goal. Approach To guide the implementation of evidence-based health care services at their institution, the authors used a number of behavioral theories and frameworks to develop the Agile Implementation (AI) Playbook, which was finalized in 2015. The AI Playbook leverages these theories in an integrated approach to selecting an evidence-based health care service to meet a specific opportunity, rapidly implementing the service, evaluating its fidelity and impact, and sustaining and scaling up the service across health care delivery organizations. The AI Playbook includes an interconnected eight-step cycle: (1) identify opportunities; (2) identify evidence-based health care services; (3) develop evaluation and termination plans; (4) assemble a team to develop a minimally viable service; (5) perform implementation sprints; (6) monitor implementation performance; (7) monitor whole system performance; and (8) develop a minimally standardized operating procedure. Outcomes The AI Playbook has helped to improve care and clinical outcomes for intensive care unit survivors and is being used to train clinicians and scientists in AI to be quality improvement advisors. Next Steps The authors plan to continue disseminating the details of the AI Playbook and illustrating how health care delivery organizations can successfully leverage it.

AB  - Abstract Background Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. Methods We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (&gt;90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV &lt;50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p&lt;0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p&lt;0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p&lt;0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p&lt;0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001) was associated with infection. Conclusions Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials. Research in Context Evidence before this study Using multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms. Added value of this study This study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients. Implication of all the available evidence Combining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms. Key points Important symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (&gt;90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV &lt;50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection

AB  - Abstract Background The PROMIS depression scales are reliable and valid measures that have extensive normative data in general population samples. However, less is known about how responsive they are to detect change in clinical settings and how their responsiveness compares to legacy measures. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the responsiveness of the PROMIS and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) depression scales in three separate samples. Methods We used data from three clinical trials (two in patients with chronic pain and one in stroke survivors) totaling 651 participants. At both baseline and follow-up, participants completed four PROMIS depression fixed-length scales as well as legacy measures: Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and 2-item scales (PHQ-9 and PHQ-2) and the SF-36 Mental Health scale. We measured global ratings of depression change, both prospectively and retrospectively, as anchors to classify patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened. Responsiveness was assessed with standardized response means, statistical tests comparing change groups, and area-under-curve analysis. Results The PROMIS depression and legacy scales had generally comparable responsiveness. Moreover, the four PROMIS depression scales of varying lengths were similarly responsive. In general, measures performed better in detecting depression improvement than depression worsening. For all measures, responsiveness varied based on the study sample and on whether depression improved or worsened. Conclusions Both PROMIS and PHQ depression scales are brief public domain measures that are responsive (i.e., sensitive to change) and thus appropriate as outcome measures in research as well as for monitoring treatment in clinical practice.

AB  - OpenMRS is an open source medical record system that was first released in 2004. This research study analyzed OpenMRS implementations by conducting a survey of implementers and by reviewing publicly available data reported to the OpenMRS Community to learn about the utilization and impact of OpenMRS over the past 15 years. Data about the use of OpenMRS were collected by conducting a survey of OpenMRS implementers that included both quantitative and qualitative questions. Data were also gathered from the OpenMRS community-hosted Atlas website and the OpenMRS Community Annual report to arrive at a comprehensive view of OpenMRS implementations. OpenMRS has been implemented in over 62 countries worldwide (Community Annual report). The survey was responded to by 16 organizations with projects spanning 16 countries, which were launched over 15 years (2004–2019). Fourteen of these sites reported a total of 1,436,357 patients; 4,248,248 visits; 18,028,204 encounters; 312,068,205 observations; and 5088 users, of which 3933 were health providers, recorded in the system database. Implementers reported a positive impact from implementing OpenMRS in streamlining operational processes for healthcare delivery; improved interoperability; improved reporting; improved availability and quality of data for decision making, advocacy, and research; and, improvement in the quality of healthcare delivery. Key challenges in implementing OpenMRS included finding skilled technical staff; acceptability of electronic health records by clinical staff; poor training provided to staff when transitioning from a paper-based to an electronic system; technical challenges, including infrastructure availability (computers, servers, equipment, connectivity, power); missing clinical/programmatic functionality in OpenMRS; poor documentation; and, difficulties faced when contributing code to the open source project. OpenMRS has a broad reach globally in a variety of settings. Organizations have reported a positive impact on health care delivery after implementing OpenMRS. Several risks and challenges were identified by implementers that need to be addressed to deliver successful implementations. Continued investment in the development of OpenMRS is needed to sustain and scale its impact.

AB  - The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers programs that reduce barriers to care for veterans and those with housing instability, poverty, and substance use disorder. In this setting, however, the role that social and behavioral risk factors play in COVID-19 outcomes is unclear.To examine whether social and behavioral risk factors were associated with mortality among US veterans with COVID-19 and whether this association might be modified by race/ethnicity.This cohort study obtained data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to form a cohort of veterans who received a positive COVID-19 test result between March 2 and September 30, 2020, in a VA health care facility. All veterans who met the inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the study, and participants were followed up for 30 days after the first SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 diagnosis. The final follow-up date was October 31, 2020.Social risk factors included housing problems and financial hardship. Behavioral risk factors included current tobacco use, alcohol use, and substance use.The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in the 30-day period after the SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 diagnosis date. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, clustering for health care facilities and adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, clinical factors, and month of COVID-19 diagnosis.Among 27 640 veterans with COVID-19 who were included in the analysis, 24 496 were men (88.6%) and the mean (SD) age was 57.2 (16.6) years. A total of 3090 veterans (11.2%) had housing problems, 4450 (16.1%) had financial hardship, 5358 (19.4%) used alcohol, and 3569 (12.9%) reported substance use. Hospitalization occurred in 7663 veterans (27.7%), and 1230 veterans (4.5%) died. Housing problems (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19; P = .70), financial hardship (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.31; P = .11), alcohol use (AOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.01; P = .06), current tobacco use (AOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.06; P = .14), and substance use (AOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71-1.15; P = .41) were not associated with higher mortality. Interaction analyses by race/ethnicity did not find associations between mortality and social and behavioral risk factors.Results of this study showed that, in an integrated health system such as the VA, social and behavioral risk factors were not associated with mortality from COVID-19. Further research is needed to substantiate the potential of an integrated health system to be a model of support services for households with COVID-19 and populations who are at risk for the disease.

AB  - We conducted semi-structured interviews with 46 surrogate decision makers for hospitalized older adults to characterize the role of spirituality and religion in decision making. Three themes emerged: (1) religion as a guide to decision making, (2) control, and (3) faith, death and dying. For religious surrogates, religion played a central role in end of life decisions. There was variability regarding whether God or humans were perceived to be in control; however, beliefs about control led to varying perspectives on acceptance of comfort-focused treatment. We conclude that clinicians should attend to religious considerations due to their impact on decision making.

AB  - Street-connected youth in Kenya are a population potentially at risk of HIV transmission, yet little is known about their perceptions and experiences of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), despite their living in an HIV endemic region. We sought to elucidate the language and sociocultural factors rooted in street life that impact on street-connected young people's knowledge of and perceptions about the prevention and transmission of STIs, and their diagnosis and treatment, using qualitative methods in western Kenya. We conducted a total of 25 in-depth interviews and 5 focus-group discussions with 65 participants aged 11-24 years in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted and data were coded according to themes and patterns emergent until saturation was reached. In general, street-connected young people knew of STIs and some of the common symptoms associated with these infections. However, there were many misconceptions regarding transmission and prevention. Gender inequities were prominent, as the majority of men described women as individuals who spread STIs due to unhygienic practices, urination and multiple partners. Due to misconceptions, gender inequity and lack of access to youth-friendly healthcare there is an urgent need for community-based organisations and healthcare facilities to introduce or augment their adolescent sexual and reproductive health programmes for vulnerable young people.

AB  - The possible association between oral infection and chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk has been studied intensively. The present study is designed to determine the strength of association between edentulism and angina pectoris in Mexican adults aged 35 years and older.Using the tools and sampling strategies of the World Health Survey of the World Health Organization, cross-sectional data were collected in Mexico in the National Performance Assessment Survey (probabilistic, multistage, and cluster sampling). Dental information was available for 20 of the 32 states of Mexico. Angina and edentulism are self-reported in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression adjusting for complex samples.A total of 13,966 participants, representing a population of 29,853,607 individuals, were included. Of the complete study population, 3,052,263 (10.2%) were completely toothless, and 673,810 (2.3%) were diagnosed with angina pectoris. After adjusting for smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, body mass index, and sex, the effect of edentulism on angina was modified by age (interaction), being more marked in the younger age group (odds ratio [OR] = exp(2.5597) =12.93) than in the older individuals surveyed (OR = exp(2.5597 + (-0.0334)) =12.51). Additionally, low physical activity (OR = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.22) and higher socioeconomic status (OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.90) were more likely to be associated with angina pectoris.Overall, the results of this study, conducted in a representative sample of Mexican adults, suggest that an association exists between edentulism and angina pectoris. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this association.

AB  - For nursing home patients, hospice use and associated costs have grown dramatically. A better understanding of hospice in all care settings, especially how patients move across settings, is needed to inform debates about appropriateness of use and potential policy reform.Our aim was to describe characteristics and utilization of hospice among nursing home and non-nursing home patients.Medicare, Medicaid and Minimum Data Set data, 1999-2008, were merged for 3,771 hospice patients aged 65 years and above from a safety net health system. Patients were classified into four groups who received hospice: 1) only in nursing homes; 2) outside of nursing homes; 3) crossover patients utilizing hospice in both settings; and 4) "near-transition" patients who received hospice within 30 days of a nursing home stay.Differences in demographics, hospice diagnoses and length of stay, utilization and costs are presented with descriptive statistics.Nursing home hospice patients were older, and more likely to be women and to have dementia (p < 0.0001). Nearly one-third (32.3 %) of crossover patients had hospice stays > 6 months, compared with the other groups (16 % of nursing home hospice only, 10.7 % of non-nursing home hospice and 7.6 % of those with near transitions) (p < 0.0001). Overall, 27.7 % of patients had a hospice stay <1 week, but there were marked differences between groups-48 % of near-transition patients vs. 7.4 % of crossover patients had these short hospice stays (p < 0.0001). Crossover and near-transition hospice patients had higher costs to Medicare compared to other groups (p < 0.05).Dichotomizing hospice users only into nursing home vs. non-nursing home patients is difficult, due to transitions across settings. Hospice patients with transitions accrue higher costs. The impact of changes to the hospice benefit on patients who live or move through nursing homes near the end of life should be carefully considered.

AB  - Objectives To examine depression and anxiety screens and their individual items as simultaneous predictors of incident diabetes mellitus. Design Ten‐year follow‐up study of individuals screened for the Improving Mood‐Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment ( IMPACT ) trial. Setting Two large urban primary care clinics in Indianapolis, Indiana. Participants Diverse sample (53% African American, 80% of lower socioeconomic status) of 2,156 older adults initially free of diabetes mellitus. Measurements Depression and anxiety screens were completed during routine primary care visits between 1999 and 2001. Incident diabetes mellitus data were obtained from an electronic medical record system and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analytical files though 2009. Results Over the 10‐year period, 558 (25.9%) participants had diabetes mellitus onset. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and diabetes mellitus risk factors revealed that a positive screen for anxiety, but not for depression, predicted incident diabetes mellitus when entered into separate models (anxiety: hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.15–1.61, P &lt; .001; depression: HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 0.95–1.46, P = .13) and when entered simultaneously into one model (anxiety: HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12–1.61, P &lt; .001; depression: HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.83–1.31, P = .73). The feeling anxious ( P = .03) and the worry ( P = .02) items predicted incident diabetes mellitus independent of the depression screen. Conclusion These findings suggest that screening positive for anxiety is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus in older adults independent of depression and traditional diabetes mellitus risk factors. Anxiety requires greater consideration and awareness in the context of diabetes mellitus risk assessment and primary prevention.

AB  - Although many family members who make surrogate decisions report problems with communication, there is no validated instrument to accurately measure surrogate/clinician communication for older adults in the acute hospital setting.The objective of this study was to validate a survey of surrogate-rated communication quality in the hospital that would be useful to clinicians, researchers, and health systems.After expert review and cognitive interviewing (n = 10 surrogates), we enrolled 350 surrogates (250 development sample and 100 validation sample) of hospitalized adults aged 65 years and older from three hospitals in one metropolitan area. The communication survey and a measure of decision quality were administered within hospital days 3 and 10. Mental health and satisfaction measures were administered six to eight weeks later.Factor analysis showed support for both one-factor (Total Communication) and two-factor models (Information and Emotional Support). Item reduction led to a final 30-item scale. For the validation sample, internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.96 (total), 0.94 (Information), and 0.90 (Emotional Support). Confirmatory factor analysis fit statistics were adequate (one-factor model, comparative fit index = 0.981, root mean square error of approximation = 0.62, weighted root mean square residual = 1.011; two-factor model comparative fit index = 0.984, root mean square error of approximation = 0.055, weighted root mean square residual = 0.930). Total score and subscales showed significant associations with the Decision Conflict Scale (Pearson correlation -0.43, P < 0.001 for total score). Emotional Support was associated with improved mental health outcomes at six to eight weeks, such as anxiety (-0.19 P < 0.001), and Information was associated with satisfaction with the hospital stay (0.49, P < 0.001).The survey shows high reliability and validity in measuring communication experiences for hospital surrogates. The scale has promise for measurement of communication quality and is predictive of important outcomes, such as surrogate satisfaction and well-being.

AB  - Objectives To describe differences in perceived quality of hospice care for individuals living at home or in a nursing home ( NH ) or assisted living facility ( ALF ) through analysis of after‐death surveys of family members. Design Retrospective cohort study using hospice medical record data and Family Evaluation of Hospice Care ( FEHC ) survey data. Setting Large, national hospice provider. Participants Individuals who died while receiving routine hospice care and family caregivers who completed after‐death quality‐of‐care surveys. Measurements Survey results for 7,510 individuals were analyzed using analysis of variance and chi‐square tests. Logistic regression was used to assess relationship between location of care and overall service quality. Results The overall survey response rate was 27%; 34.5% of families of individuals in ALF s in hospice, 27.4% of those at home, and 22.9% of those in NH s returned the survey ( P &lt; .001). Differences in return rate according to primary diagnosis were significant, although differences were not large. Most (84.3%) respondents reported that hospice referral had occurred at the right time, and 63.4% rated service quality as excellent. Hospice care in the NH was less likely to be perceived as excellent. Conclusion There were significant differences in characteristics of individuals whose family members did and did not return surveys, which has implications for use of after‐death surveys to evaluate hospice quality. Lower perceived quality of hospice care in NH s may be related to general dissatisfaction with receiving care in this setting. Survey results have the potential to set priorities for quality improvement, choice of provider, and potentially reimbursement. Underlying causes of differences of perceived quality in different settings of care should be examined.

AB  - An electronic medication reconciliation tool was previously developed by another research team to aid provider-patient communication for medication reconciliation. To evaluate the usability of this tool, we integrated artificial safety probes into standard usability methods. The objective of this article is to describe this method of using safety probes, which enabled us to evaluate how well the tool supports users’ detection of medication discrepancies. We completed a mixed-method usability evaluation in a simulated setting with 30 participants: 20 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 10 patients. We used factual scenarios but embedded three artificial safety probes: (1) a missing medication (i.e., omission); (2) an extraneous medication (i.e., commission); and (3) an inaccurate dose (i.e., dose discrepancy). We measured users’ detection of each probe to estimate the probability that a HCP or patient would detect these discrepancies. Additionally, we recorded participants’ detection of naturally occurring discrepancies. Each safety probe was detected by ≤50% of HCPs. Patients’ detection rates were generally higher. Estimates indicate that a HCP and patient, together, would detect 44.8% of these medication discrepancies. Additionally, HCPs and patients detected 25 and 45 naturally-occurring discrepancies, respectively. Overall, detection of medication discrepancies was low. Findings indicate that more advanced interface designs are warranted. Future research is needed on how technologies can be designed to better aid HCPs’ and patients’ detection of medication discrepancies. This is one of the first studies to evaluate the usability of a collaborative medication reconciliation tool and assess HCPs’ and patients’ detection of medication discrepancies. Results demonstrate that embedded safety probes can enhance standard usability methods by measuring additional, clinically-focused usability outcomes. The novel safety probes we used may serve as an initial, standard set for future medication reconciliation research. More prevalent use of safety probes could strengthen usability research for a variety of health information technologies.

AB  - Purpose Patients with advanced cancer (ACPs) participating in phase I clinical trials inadequately understand many elements of informed consent (IC); however, the prevalence and impact of cognitive impairment has not been described. Patients and Methods ACPs enrolled onto phase I trials underwent neuropsychological assessment to evaluate cognitive functioning (CF) covering the following domains: memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), executive functioning (Trail Making Test B), language (Boston Naming Test-Short Version and Controlled Oral Word Association Test), attention (Trail Making Test A and Wechsler Adult Intelligenence Scale-IV Digit Span), comprehension (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function). Structured interviews evaluated IC and decisional capacity. Psychological measures included distress (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II). Results One hundred eighteen ACPs on phase I trials were evaluated, with CF ranging from mild impairment to superior performance. Only 45% of ACPs recalled physician disclosure of the phase I trial purpose. The 50% of ACPs who correctly identified the phase I research purpose had greater CF compared with ACPs who did not, as revealed by the mean T scores for memory (37.2 ± 5.6 v 32.5 ± 5.1, respectively; P = .001), attention (29 ± 2.7 v 26.9 ± 2.4, respectively; P < .001), visual attention (35.2 ± 6.6 v 31.5 ± 6.2, respectively; P = .001), and executive function (38.9 ± 7.5 v 34 ± 7.1, respectively; P < .001). Older ACPs (≥ 60 years) were less likely to recall physician disclosure of phase I purpose than younger ACPs (30% v 70%, respectively; P = .02) and had measurable deficits in total memory (34.2 ± 5.0 v 37.3 ± 5.6, respectively; P = .002), attention (24.5 ± 2.6 v 28 ± 2.8, respectively; P < .001), and executive function (32.8 ± 7.3 v 36.4 ± 7.6, respectively; P = .01). Older ACPs, compared with younger ACPs, also had greater depression scores (10.6 ± 9.2 v 8.1 ± 5.2, respectively; P = .03) and lower quality-of-life scores (152 ± 29.6 v 167 ± 20, respectively; P = .03). After adjustment by age, no psychological or neuropsychological variable was further significantly associated with likelihood of purpose identification. Conclusion CF seems to play a role in ACP recall and comprehension of IC for early-phase clinical trials, especially among older ACPs.

AB  - Unpaid informal caregivers of adult care recipients, including persons with dementia, experience multiple unmet information needs and information management challenges.To understand the current personal health information management (PHIM) practices in informal caregiving for adults with and without dementia.Semi-structured interviews were performed with ten informal caregivers-half of whom were caring for persons with dementia-and four formal caregivers at an adult day service. Interviews centered on a paper-based tool distributed by the day service, the CARE Kit, permitting an artifacts analysis of the tools used by participants for PHIM. Qualitative thematic analysis was applied to interview data.Caregivers' PHIM practices aimed to support daily care management and decision-making on behalf of care recipients, through: 1) information acquisition and integration across multiple sources and records; 2) information maintenance, updating, and use over time; and 3) information sharing and communication with healthcare professionals and other family caregivers. Participants reported advantages and challenges of their PHIM practices and tools, including fitting PHIM into their daily lives, managing PHIM-related cognitive workload, the functionality of PHIM tools, and the dynamic, longitudinal nature of PHIM.The study produced a number of implications for caregiver health information management information technology (CHIM IT), based on findings about the nature of caregivers' practices for managing information for adult care recipients. We present CHIM IT requirements related to privacy and security, customization and flexibility, ease of use, credibility and sensitivity, situation awareness, information integration, delegation and shared use, updating and maintenance, archiving and versioning, communication, agency and information access, and validation.

AB  - Abstract Background This statewide survey sought to understand the adoption level of new health information and medical technologies, and whether these patterns differed between urban and rural populations. Methods A random sample of 7,979 people aged 18‐75 years, stratified by rural status and race, who lived in 1 of 34 Indiana counties with high cancer mortality rates and were seen at least once in the past year in a statewide health system were surveyed. Results Completed surveys were returned by 970 participants. Rural patients were less likely than urban to use electronic health record messaging systems (28.3% vs 34.5%, P = .045) or any communication technology (43.0% vs 50.8%, P = .017). Rural patients were less likely to look for personal health information for someone else's medical record (11.0% vs 16.3%, P = .022), look‐up test results (29.5% vs 38.3%, P = .005), or use any form of electronic medical record (EMR) access (57.5% vs 67.1%, P = .003). Rural differences in any use of communication technology or EMRs were no longer significant in adjusted models, while education and income were significantly associated. There was a trend in the higher use of low‐dose computed tomography (CT) scan among rural patients (19.1% vs 14.4%, P = .057). No significant difference was present between rural and urban patients in the use of the human papilloma virus test (27.1% vs 26.6%, P = .880). Conclusions Differences in health information technology use between rural and urban populations may be moderated by social determinants. Lower adoption of new health information technologies (HITs) than medical technologies among rural, compared to urban, individuals may be due to lower levels of evidence supporting HITs.

AB  - Chronic cough (CC) of 8 weeks or more affects about 10% of adults and may lead to expensive treatments and reduced quality of life. Incomplete diagnostic coding complicates identifying CC in electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) of EHR text could improve detection.Can NLP be used to identify cough in EHRs, and to characterize adults and encounters with CC?A Midwestern EHR system identified patients aged 18 to 85 years during 2005 to 2015. NLP was used to evaluate text notes, except prescriptions and instructions, for mentions of cough. Two physicians and a biostatistician reviewed 12 sets of 50 encounters each, with iterative refinements, until the positive predictive value for cough encounters exceeded 90%. NLP, International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, or medication was used to identify cough. Three encounters spanning 56 to 120 days defined CC. Descriptive statistics summarized patients and encounters, including referrals.Optimizing NLP required identifying and eliminating cough denials, instructions, and historical references. Of 235,457 cough encounters, 23% had a relevant diagnostic code or medication. Applying chronicity to cough encounters identified 23,371 patients (61% women) with CC. NLP alone identified 74% of these patients; diagnoses or medications alone identified 15%. The positive predictive value of NLP in the reviewed sample was 97%. Referrals for cough occurred for 3.0% of patients; pulmonary medicine was most common initially (64% of referrals).Some patients with diagnosis codes for cough, encounters at intervals greater than 4 months, or multiple acute cough episodes may have been misclassified.NLP successfully identified a large cohort with CC. Most patients were identified through NLP alone, rather than diagnoses or medications. NLP improved detection of patients nearly sevenfold, addressing the gap in ability to identify and characterize CC disease burden. Nearly all cases appeared to be managed in primary care. Identifying these patients is important for characterizing treatment and unmet needs.

AB  - The American Medical Association updated guidance in 2021 for frequently used billing codes for outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) visits. The intent was to account for provider time outside of face-to-face encounters and to reduce onerous documentation requirements.To analyze E/M visit use, documentation length, and time spent in the electronic health record (EHR) before and after the guideline change.Observational, retrospective, pre-post study.U.S.-based ambulatory practices using the Epic Systems EHR.303 547 advanced practice providers and physicians across 389 organizations.Data from September 2020 through April 2021 containing weekly provider-level E/M code and EHR use metadata were extracted from the Epic Signal database. We descriptively analyzed overall and specialty-specific changes in E/M visit use, note length, and time spent in the EHR before and after the new guidelines using provider-level paired t tests.Following the new guidelines, level 3 visits decreased by 2.41 percentage points (95% CI, -2.48 to -2.34 percentage points) to 38.5% of all E/M visits, a 5.9% relative decrease from fall 2020. Level 4 visits increased by 0.89 percentage points (CI, 0.82 to 0.96 percentage points) to 40.9% of E/M visits, a 2.2% relative increase. Level 5 visits (the highest acuity level) increased by 1.85 percentage points (CI, 1.81 to 1.89 percentage points) to 10.1% of E/M visits, a 22.6% relative increase. These changes varied by specialty. We found no meaningful changes in measures of note length or time spent in the EHR.The Epic ambulatory client base may underrepresent smaller and independent practices.Immediate changes in E/M coding contrast with null findings for changes in both note length and EHR time. Provider organizations are positioned to respond more rapidly to billing process changes than to changes in care delivery and associated EHR use behaviors. Fully realizing the intended benefits of this guideline change will require more time, facilitation, and scaling of best practices that more directly address EHR documentation practices and associated burden.None.

AB  - Postintensive care syndrome–family (PICS-F) describes the psychological symptoms that affect the family members of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) or recently discharged from the ICU. Geriatric psychiatrists should be concerned about PICS-F for several reasons. First, ICU hospitalization in older adults is associated with higher rates of cognitive and physical impairment compared with older adults hospitalized in non-ICU settings or dwelling in the community. This confers a special burden on the caregivers of these older ICU survivors compared with other geriatric populations. Second, as caregivers themselves age, caring for this unique burden can be more challenging compared with other geriatric populations. Third, evidence for models of care centered on patients with multimorbidity and their caregivers is limited. A deeper understanding of how to care for PICS and PICS-F may inform clinical practice for other geriatric populations with multimorbidity and their caregivers. Geriatric psychiatrists may play a key role in delivering coordinated care for PICS-F by facilitating timely diagnosis and interdisciplinary collaboration, advocating for the healthcare needs of family members suffering from PICS-F, and leading efforts within healthcare systems to increase awareness and treatment of PICS-F. This clinical review will appraise the current literature about the impact of critical illness on the family members of ICU survivors and identify crucial gaps in our knowledge about PICS-F among aging patients and caregivers.

AB  - Depression may be a predictor and consequence of obesity. However, available evidence for racial minorities has been inconsistent, and more prospective studies are needed. Thus, this study's objective was to examine whether depressive symptom severity is a predictor and/or consequence of total adiposity over a 9-year period in a representative sample of late middle-aged African-Americans.A total of 410 participants (aged 49-65 years; baseline) in the prospective cohort African American Health study were examined. Depressive symptom severity was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Total body fat percent (BF%) and body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2) ) were assessed. Structural equation models were tested.All model fit statistics, other than χ(2) , indicated good fit (RMSEA ≤ 0.058, SRMR ≤ 0.052, CFI ≥ 0.95). Baseline CES-D did not predict 9-year changes in BF% (β = -0.01, P = 0.78) or BMI (β = -0.01, P = 0.77). Baseline BF% (β = 0.05, P = 0.39) and BMI (β = 0.08, P = 0.095) did not predict 9-year change in CES-D.Depressive symptom severity was not a predictor or consequence of excess total adiposity in late middle-aged African-American adults. Including a depression module in obesity prevention and treatment programs specifically designed for late middle-aged African-Americans may not have a beneficial effect on obesity outcomes.

AB  - Background Thrombocytopenia has been associated with increased mortality in nonstroke conditions. Because its role in acute ischemic stroke is less well understood, we sought to determine whether thrombocytopenia at admission for acute ischemic stroke was associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods We used data from a retrospective cohort of stroke patients (1998-2003) at 5 U.S. hospitals. Risk factors considered included conditions that can lead to thrombocytopenia (e.g., liver disease), increase bleeding risk (e.g., hemophilia), medications with antiplatelet effects (e.g., aspirin), and known predictors of mortality (e.g., National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores). Logistic regression modeling evaluated the adjusted association between thrombocytopenia, defined as platelets <100,000/μL, and in-hospital mortality. Results Among 1233 acute ischemic stroke patients, thrombocytopenia was present in 2.3% (n = 28). A total of 6.1% (n = 75) of patients died in the hospital. In unadjusted analyses, thrombocytopenia was associated with higher mortality (8/28 [28.6%] v 67/1205 [5.6%]; P < .0001). Thrombocytopenia was also independently associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and comorbidities, with an odds ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval 2.3-18.6). Conclusions Admission thrombocytopenia among patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke predicts in-hospital mortality. Thrombocytopenia has been associated with increased mortality in nonstroke conditions.

AB  - To assess the influence of symptom intensity, mood, and comorbidities on patient-clinician agreement and the consistency of responses to functional patient-reported outcomes (PROs).Two data sources were used. The first, a cross-sectional database of patients with breast cancer who completed functional PROs and were administered the FIM, was used to examine whether average pain intensity (as measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) and Rand Mental Health inventory scores differed among those rating their functional independence as different than clinicians. The second, a longitudinal database of 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer who completed the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM PAC CAT) with differences between their expected and actual responses as reflected in their AM PAC CAT SEs.Two tertiary medical centers.Data source #1, 163 women with stage IV breast cancer; data source #2, 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer.Not applicable.Data source #1, FIM, pain NRS, Older Americans Resource Study activities of daily living subscale, Physical Function-10, Mental Health Inventory-17. Data source #2, AM PAC CAT and NRS symptom ratings.Pain intensity was significantly higher when clinicians and patients disagreed regarding a patient's independence in the ability to transfer (NRS pain severity, 3.78 vs 2.40; P=.014), groom (3.71 vs 2.36, P=.009), bathe (3.76 vs 2.40, P=.016), and dress (3.09 vs 2.44, P=.034). The magnitude of AM PAC CAT SEs was significantly associated with the severity of participants' pain, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as the presence of musculoskeletal disorders and coronary artery disease. Neither mood nor emotional distress was associated with clinician-patient agreement or AM PAC CAT SE.Pain intensity is associated with disagreement between patients and clinicians about the patient's level of functioning. Moreover, physical symptoms (pain, dyspnea, fatigue) as well as specific medical comorbidities (musculoskeletal disorders, coronary artery disease), but not mood, are associated with inconsistency in patients' assessment of their functional abilities.

AB  - Joint modeling of recurrent events and a terminal event has been studied extensively in the past decade. However, most of the previous works assumed constant regression coefficients. This paper proposes a joint model with time‐varying coefficients in both event components. The proposed model not only accommodates the correlation between the two type of events, but also characterizes the potential time‐varying covariate effects. It is especially useful for evaluating long‐term risk factors' effect that could vary with time. A Gaussian frailty is used to model the correlation between event times. The nonparametric time‐varying coefficients are modeled using cubic splines with penalty terms. A simulation study shows that the proposed estimators perform well. The model is used to analyze the readmission rate and mortality jointly for stroke patients admitted to Veterans Administration (VA) Hospitals.

AB  - Abstract Relationships between industry and university‐based researchers have been commonplace for decades and have received notable attention concerning the conflicts of interest these relationships may harbor. While new efforts are being made to update conflict of interest policies and make industry relationships with academia more transparent, the development of broader institutional partnerships between industry and academic health centers challenges the efficacy of current policy to effectively manage these innovative partnerships. In this paper, we argue that existing strategies to reduce conflicts of interest are not sufficient to address the emerging models of industry‐academic partnerships because they focus too narrowly on financial matters and are not comprehensive enough to mitigate all ethical risk. Moreover, conflict‐of‐interest strategies are not designed to promote best practices nor the scientific and social benefits of academic‐industry collaboration. We propose a framework of principles and benchmarks for “ethically credible partnerships” between industry and academic health centers and describe how this framework may provide a practical and comprehensive approach for designing and evaluating such partnerships.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of telemonitoring plus education by home healthcare nurses on health-related quality of life in patients with heart failure who had varying health literacy levels. In this pretest/posttest treatment only study, 35 patients with a diagnosis of heart failure received home healthcare nurse visits, including education and telemonitoring. Heart failure education was provided by nurses at each home healthcare visit for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. All participants completed the Short-Form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) during the first week of home healthcare services. The MLHFQ was administered again at the completion of the covered home healthcare services period (1-3 visits per week for 10 weeks). Most participants were older adults (mean age 70.91±12.47) and had adequate health literacy (51.4%). Almost half of the participants were NYHA Class III (47.1%). All participants received individual heart failure education, but this did not result in statistically significant improvements in health-related quality-of-life scores. With telemonitoring and home healthcare nurse visits, quality-of-life scores improved by the conclusion of home healthcare services (clinically significant), but the change was not statistically significant. Individuals with marginal and inadequate health literacy ability were able to correctly use the telemonitoring devices.

The physiologic effects of aging as well as multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and other geriatric-specific syndromes create additional challenges when elderly patients experience a traumatic injury. However, there is a growing evidence base that can inform the clinical decision-making process. This narrative review of the literature addresses the state of the science regarding geriatric syndromes, guidelines and protocols, indices and models for prognostication, outcomes and ethical concerns in the treatment of geriatric trauma.

The AMIA Board of Directors has endorsed a set of proposed AHIC eligibility requirements that will be presented to the future AHIC certifying entity for adoption. These requirements specifically establish who will be eligible to sit for the AHIC examination and more generally signal the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience expected from certified individuals. They also inform the development of the accreditation process and provide guidance to graduate health informatics programs as well as individuals interested in pursuing AHIC. AHIC eligibility will be determined by practice focus, education in primary field and health informatics, and significant health informatics experience.

The Workflow Elements Model was used to guide data collection and analysis of 59 h of observation, supplemented by key informant input. We identified four actors, 37 artifacts across seven types, ten action categories, and ten outcomes including improved health and safety. Five themes emerged regarding barriers and facilitators to care delivery in the program: the centrality of relationship building; the use of adaptive workarounds; performance of duplicate work; travel and scheduling challenges; and communication-related factors. Findings offer new insight into how mental healthcare services are delivered in a community-based program and key work-related factors shaping program outcomes.

AB  - We assessed the usability of consultation order templates and identified problems to prioritize in design efforts for improving referral communication. With a sample of 26 consultation order templates, three evaluators performed a usability heuristic evaluation. The evaluation used 14 domain-independent heuristics and the following three supplemental references: 1 new domain-specific heuristic, 6 usability goals, and coded clinicians’ statements regarding ease of use for 10 sampled templates. Evaluators found 201 violations, a mean of 7.7 violations per template. Minor violations outnumbered major violations almost twofold, 115 (57%) to 62 (31%). Approximately 68% of violations were linked to 5 heuristics: aesthetic and minimalist design (17%), error prevention (16%), consistency and standards (14%), recognition rather than recall (11%), and meet referrers’ information needs (10%). Severe violations were attributed mostly to meet referrers’ information needs and recognition rather than recall. Recorded violations yielded potential negative consequences for efficiency, effectiveness, safety, learnability, and utility. Evaluators and clinicians demonstrated 80% agreement in usability assessment. Based on frequency and severity of usability heuristic violations, the consultation order templates reviewed may impede clinical efficiency and risk patient safety. Results support the following design considerations: communicate consultants’ requirements, facilitate information seeking, and support communication. While the most frequent heuristic violations involved interaction design and presentation, the most severe violations lacked information desired by referring clinicians. Violations related to templates’ inability to support referring clinicians’ information needs had the greatest potential negative impact on efficiency and safety usability goals. Heuristics should be prioritized in future design efforts.

AB  - Opioid diversion, misuse, and abuse are rapidly growing problems in the United States; >60% of all drug overdose deaths involve an opioid. At least 49 states now have fully operational prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to support legitimate medical use of controlled substances; however, there is considerable underutilization of such programs.To increase awareness of PDMPs and their use, a continuing medical education program including 2 webcasts and a series of newsletters was offered to health care providers.Four hundred and sixty-five clinicians participated in 1 of 2 webcasts. Of those, 207 clinicians responded to a pre-survey and 64 responded to a post-survey. Slightly more than half of clinicians were registered for their state's PDMP program before the educational intervention, and although significantly more clinicians reported increased likelihood to access their state PDMP after participation, the number that actually registered only trended toward a statistically significant increase to 74% after the education (P = 0.06). Immediate post-activity evaluation also indicated that the education significantly improved clinician knowledge of the characteristics of addiction, findings in a PDMP that would suggest diversion or abuse, and strategies to complement the use of a PDMP (P < 0.001).Continuing medical education is effective for improving clinician knowledge and confidence related to opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion and effective use of a PDMP; however, the education did not result in a significant increase in enrollment in state PDMPs.

AB  - Background Partners of breast cancer survivors experience the effects of a spouse’s cancer years after treatment. Partners of younger survivors (YPs) may experience greater problems than partners of older survivors (OPs), just as younger survivors experience greater problems than their older counterparts. Objectives The aims of this study were to (1) compare quality of life (QoL) in YPs and OPs and (2) determine contributing factors to each group’s QoL. Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from YPs (n = 227) and OPs (n = 281) through self-report. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine differences between YPs and OPs on QoL while controlling for covariates. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine what contributes to each group’s QoL. Results Partners of younger survivors reported better physical function (effect size [ES], −0.57), lower marital satisfaction (ES, 0.39), and lower overall QoL (ES, 0.43) than OPs. Predictors of QoL also differed between partner groups. For YPs, overall QoL was predicted by greater physical functioning, fewer depressive symptoms, higher marital satisfaction, higher parenting satisfaction, and more personal resources ( R 2 = 0.47, F 5,195 = 35.05, P &lt; .001). For OPs, overall QoL was predicted by fewer depressive symptoms, higher parenting satisfaction, higher spirituality, and greater social support from the breast cancer survivor spouse ( R 2 = 0.33, F 4,244 = 29.80, P &lt; .001). Conclusion Partners of older survivors reported greater QoL than YPs. Common factors contributing to QoL between YPs and OPs were fewer depressive symptoms and higher parenting satisfaction. Implications for Practice Partners of breast cancer survivors may need support coping with their spouse/partner’s cancer. Partners of younger survivors may require more support than OPs.

AB  - Introduction Direct-to-consumer genetic tests for inherited disease risks have gained recent approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, and interest in these tests has continued to grow. Broad use of these tests coupled with planning and discussion with health providers regarding genetic risks and potential protective behavior changes have been proposed as preventive tools to reduce health disparities and improve equity in health outcomes. However, awareness of direct-to-consumer genetic testing has historically demonstrated differences by education, income, and race; these disparities could jeopardize potential benefits by limiting access and use. Methods The national survey data from the Health Information National Trends Survey was analyzed to understand how overall awareness of direct-to-consumer genetic testing and disparities in awareness across sociodemographic groups have changed since 2007. Results The findings showed persistent disparities, as well as a widening gap in awareness between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (OR2007 =1.52, OR2014 =0.58, pchange =0.0056), despite overall increases in awareness over time. Conclusions Given these findings, policies regulating direct-to-consumer genetic tests should prioritize equitable distribution of benefits by including provisions that counteract prevailing disparities in awareness.

AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major public health problem. Although opioid prescribing for chronic pain has increased dramatically since the 1990s, this practice has come under scrutiny because of increases in opioid-related harms and lack of evidence for long-term effectiveness. The Strategies for Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness (SPACE) trial was a pragmatic 12-month randomized trial comparing the benefits and harms of opioid versus nonopioid medications for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The current qualitative study was designed to better understand trial results by exploring patients’ experiences, including perceptions of medications, experiences with the intervention, and whether expectations were met. Thirty-four participants who were purposefully sampled based on treatment group and intervention response participated in semistructured interviews. The constant comparison method guided analysis. Results revealed that participants often held strong beliefs about opioid medications, which sometimes changed during the trial as they gained experience with medications; participants described a wide variety of experiences with treatment effectiveness, regardless of study group or their response to the intervention; and participants highly valued the personalized pain care model used in SPACE. Perspective SPACE trial results indicated no advantage for opioid over nonopioid medications. Qualitative findings suggest that, for both treatment groups, preexisting expectations and anticipated improvement in pain shaped experiences with and responses to medications. The personalized pain care model was described as contributing to positive outcomes in both groups.

AB  - Abstract Introduction U.S. policy on interoperable HIT has focused on increasing inter-system (ie, between different organizations) health information exchange. However, interoperable HIT also supports the movement of information within the same organization (ie, intra-system exchange). Methods We examined the relationship between hospitals’ intra- and inter-system information exchange capabilities among health system hospitals included in the 2010-2014 American Hospital Association’s Annual Health Information Technology Survey. We described the factors associated with hospitals that adopted more intra-system than inter-system exchange capability, and explored the extent of new capability adoption among hospitals that reported neither intra- or inter-system information capabilities at baseline. Results The prevalence of exchange increased over time, but the adoption of inter-system information exchange was slower; when hospitals adopt information exchange, adoption of intra-system exchange was more common. On average during our study period, hospitals could share 4.6 types of information by intra-system exchange, but only 2.7 types of information by inter-system exchange. Controlling for other factors, hospitals exchanged more types of information in an intra-system manner than inter-system when the number of different inpatient EHR vendors in use in health system is larger. Conclusion Consistent with the U.S. goals for more widely accessible patient information, hospitals’ ability to share information has increased over time. However, hospitals are prioritizing within-organizational information exchange over exchange between different organizations. If increasing inter-system exchanges is a desired goal, current market incentives and government policies may be insufficient to overcome hospitals’ motivations for pursuing an intra-system-information-exchange-first strategy.

AB  - Objectives As an aging population drives more demand for elective inpatient surgery, one approach to reducing length of stay is enhanced evaluation of patients’ preoperative health status. The objective of this research was to determine whether patient-reported outcome measures collected preoperatively can identify patients at risk for longer lengths of stay. Methods This study was based on a prospectively recruited cohort of patients who were scheduled for elective inpatient general surgery in Vancouver, Canada. All participants completed a number of patient-reported outcome measures preoperatively, including the EQ-5D for general health status, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the pain intensity (P), interference with enjoyment of life (E), and interference with general activity (G), known as the PEG, for pain. Patient-reported outcome data were linked to hospital discharge summaries. Multivariate regression was performed to estimate risk of longer lengths of stay, adjusting for patient and clinical characteristics. The primary outcome was length of stay and its associated cost. Data collection took place between October 2012 and November 2016. Results Participation among the population of 2307 eligible patients was 50.5%, providing 1165 participants. Preoperative patient-reported outcomes were not concordant with hospital reported diagnoses of depression or pain. Patients’ preoperative depression and pain scores were independently positively associated with longer length of stay after adjusting for patient-level characteristics. Patients whose PHQ-9 score was 10, representing clinically significant depression, were estimated to have a 1.53 day longer hospitalization, which was associated with an estimated incremental hospital cost of $1667. Conclusions Preoperative self-reported assessment of depression and pain can assist with identifying patients at higher risk of longer lengths of stay. Patient’s self-reported preoperative measures of depression and pain should be incorporated into patient pathways. They provide opportunities for improving management of general surgery patients and possibly play a role in aligning hospital funding with patients’ needs.

AB  - Smoking is an established risk factor for oral diseases and, therefore, dental clinicians routinely assess and record their patients' detailed smoking status. Researchers have successfully extracted smoking history from electronic health records (EHRs) using text mining methods. However, they could not retrieve patients' smoking intensity due to its limited availability in the EHR. The presence of detailed smoking information in the electronic dental record (EDR) often under a separate section allows retrieving this information with less preprocessing.To determine patients' detailed smoking status based on smoking intensity from the EDR.First, the authors created a reference standard of 3,296 unique patients' smoking histories from the EDR that classified patients based on their smoking intensity. Next, they trained three machine learning classifiers (support vector machine, random forest, and naïve Bayes) using the training set (2,176) and evaluated performances on test set (1,120) using precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F). Finally, they applied the best classifier to classify smoking status from an additional 3,114 patients' smoking histories.Support vector machine performed best to classify patients into smokers, nonsmokers, and unknowns (P, R, F: 98%); intermittent smoker (P: 95%, R: 98%, F: 96%); past smoker (P, R, F: 89%); light smoker (P, R, F: 87%); smokers with unknown intensity (P: 76%, R: 86%, F: 81%), and intermediate smoker (P: 90%, R: 88%, F: 89%). It performed moderately to differentiate heavy smokers (P: 90%, R: 44%, F: 60%). EDR could be a valuable source for obtaining patients' detailed smoking information.EDR data could serve as a valuable source for obtaining patients' detailed smoking information based on their smoking intensity that may not be readily available in the EHR.

AB  - Long thought “relics” of evolution, not until recently have pseudogenes been of medical interest regarding regulation in cancer. Often, these regulatory roles are a direct by-product of their close sequence homology to protein-coding genes. Novel pseudogene-gene (PGG) functional associations can be identified through the integration of biomedical data, such as sequence homology, functional pathways, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and microRNA expression. However, not all of the information has been integrated, and almost all previous pseudogene studies relied on 1:1 pseudogene–parent gene relationships without leveraging other homologous genes/pseudogenes. We produce PGG families that expand beyond the current 1:1 paradigm. First, we construct expansive PGG databases by (i) CUDAlign graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated local alignment of all pseudogenes to gene families (totaling 1.6 billion individual local alignments and >40,000 GPU hours) and (ii) BLAST-based assignment of pseudogenes to gene families. Second, we create an open-source web application (PseudoFuN [Pseudogene Functional Networks]) to search for integrative functional relationships of sequence homology, microRNA expression, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and gene ontology. We produce four “flavors” of CUDAlign-based databases (>462,000,000 PGG pairwise alignments and 133,770 PGG families) that can be queried and downloaded using PseudoFuN. These databases are consistent with previous 1:1 PGG annotation and also are much more powerful including millions of de novo PGG associations. For example, we find multiple known (e.g., miR-20a-PTEN-PTENP1) and novel (e.g., miR-375-SOX15-PPP4R1L) microRNA-gene-pseudogene associations in prostate cancer. PseudoFuN provides a “one stop shop” for identifying and visualizing thousands of potential regulatory relationships related to pseudogenes in The Cancer Genome Atlas cancers. Thousands of new PGG associations can be explored in the context of microRNA-gene-pseudogene co-expression and differential expression with a simple-to-use online tool by bioinformaticians and oncologists alike.

AB  - Chronic pain is a complex accumulation of physical, psychological, and social conditions, thus interventions that address pain and promote occupational performance are needed. A holistic intervention, with mind and body components, is likely necessary to best treat the complexities of chronic pain. Thus, we developed and tested a yoga intervention for people with chronic pain.In a randomized control trial (RCT), participants with chronic pain were randomized to a yoga intervention or usual care group. Between and within group differences for pre-and post-outcome measure scores were assessed for: occupational performance, completion of activities, and depression.Pilot RCT with participant allocation to 8 weeks of yoga or usual care. Both groups received ongoing monthly self-management programming. Data were collected before and after the 8-week intervention. Participants were randomized to yoga or usual care after baseline assessments. Demographics were collected and measures included: Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to assess occupational performance; the 15-item Frenchay Activities Index (FAI)(activities); and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. Independent t-tests were used to assess differences between groups. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences between pre- and post 8-week intervention for both the yoga and the usual care groups. Percent change scores and effect sizes were calculated.83 people were recruited for the study and completed baseline assessments; 44 individuals were randomized to yoga and 39 to the control group. The average age of all participants was 51.4±10.5 years, 68% were female; and 60% had at least some college education. There were no significant differences in demographics or outcome measures between groups at baseline or 8 weeks; however, the study was not powered to see such differences. Individuals randomized to the control group did not significantly improve in any outcome measure over the 8 weeks. There were significant improvements in COPM performance and COPM satisfaction scores for individuals randomized to the yoga group; both scores significantly improved. COPM performance improved by 27% with a moderate to large effect size (3.66±1.85 vs 4.66±1.93, p < 0.001, d = 0.76). COPM satisfaction significantly improved by 78% (2.14±2.31 vs. 3.80±2.50, p < 0.001) and had a large effects size (d = 1.02). FAI scores improved, indicating increased activity or engagement in daily occupation during the 8-week intervention. Scores increased by 5% (38.13±8.48 vs. 39.90±8.57, p = 0.024) with a small effect size (d = 0.37). Depression significantly decreased from 13.21±5.60 to 11.41±5.82, p = 0.041, with a small effect size.Data from this pilot RCT indicate yoga may be an effective therapeutic intervention with people in chronic pain to improve occupational performance, increase engagement in activities, and decrease depression. Occupational therapy practitioners may consider adding yoga as a treatment intervention to address the needs of people with pain.

AB  - Abstract Cortical thickness is traditionally derived from T1-weighted MRI images. Recent studies have shown an improvement in segmentation with the combination of T1 + T2-FLAIR images. MRI data from 54 adults (mean: 71 years, 65–81 years, 48% females) that are part of an ongoing cohort study were analyzed to investigate whether T1 + T2-FLAIR cortical thickness measurements were superior to those derived from T1-weighted images in identifying age-related atrophy. T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR MRI images were processed through FreeSurfer v6.0. Data was extracted using the Desikan-Killiany (DKT) atlas. FreeSurfer’s GUI QDEC examined age-related atrophy. Nonparametric tests, effect sizes, and Pearson correlations examined differences between T1-only and T1 + T2-FLAIR cortical thickness data. These analyses demonstrated that T1 + T2-FLAIR processed images significantly improved the segmentation of gray matter (chi-square x 2 , p &lt; 0.05) and demonstrated significantly thicker cortical thickness means (p &lt; 0.05) with medium to large effect sizes. Significant regions of age-related cortical atrophy were identified within the T1 + T2-FLAIR data (FDR corrected, p &lt; 0.05). This is in contrast to the T1-only data where no regions survived FDR correction. In summary, T1 + T2-FLAIR data were associated with significant improvement in cortical segmentation and the identification of age-related cortical atrophy. Future studies should consider employing this imaging strategy to obtain cortical thickness measurements sensitive to age-related changes.

AB  - Emotional distress often causes patients with cancer and their family caregivers (FCGs) to avoid end-of-life discussions and advance care planning (ACP), which may undermine quality of life (QoL). Most ACP interventions fail to address emotional barriers that impede timely ACP.We assessed feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a mindfulness-based intervention to facilitate ACP for adults with advanced-stage cancer and their FCGs.A single-arm pilot was conducted to assess the impact of a 6-week group mindfulness intervention on ACP behaviors (patients only), QoL, family communication, avoidant coping, distress, and other outcomes from baseline (T1) to post-intervention (T2) and 1 month later (T3).Eligible patients had advanced-stage solid malignancies, limited ACP engagement, and an FCG willing to participate. Thirteen dyads (N = 26 participants) enrolled at an academic cancer center in the United States.Of eligible patients, 59.1% enrolled. Attendance (70.8% across 6 sessions) and retention (84.6% for patients; 92.3% for FCGs) through T3 were acceptable. Over 90% of completers reported high intervention satisfaction. From T1 to T3, patient engagement more than doubled in each of 3 ACP behaviors assessed. Patients reported large significant decreases in distress at T2 and T3. Family caregivers reported large significant improvements in QoL and family communication at T2 and T3. Both patients and FCGs reported notable reductions in sleep disturbance and avoidant coping at T3.The mindfulness intervention was feasible and acceptable and supported improvements in ACP and associated outcomes for patients and FCGs. A randomized trial of mindfulness training for ACP is warranted. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT02367508 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02367508 ).

AB  - Background Admissions to the ICU related to alcohol, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs are shown to be widespread and costly. In 1993, a study revealed 28% of ICU admissions at Johns Hopkins Hospital were related to substance abuse and accrued 39% of costs. Since then, health-care expenditures have increased, and substance abuse treatment admissions have risen. We conducted a study to provide updated data on ICU utilization and costs related to licit and illicit abuse at a large county hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. Methods All admissions to the medical ICU at Eskenazi Hospital from March to October 2017 were reviewed. Demographics, reason for admission, relation to substance abuse and specific substance, ICU and hospital length of stay, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, mortality, insurance status, and hospital charges were collected based on chart review. Results A total of 611 admissions generated $74,587,280.35 in charges. A total of 25.7% of admissions related to substance abuse accounted for 23.1% of total charges. Illicit drugs were 13% of total admissions, generating 11% of charges. Alcohol-related admissions were 9.5% of total admissions, generating 7.6% of charges. Prescription drugs were 2.9% of admissions, generating 4.2% of charges. Of the substance abuse admissions, patients were generally men and 40 to 64 years of age, with longer ICU stay, higher APACHE II scores, and higher mortality. Conclusions Substance abuse admissions make up almost a one-quarter of resources used by our ICU. Patients tend to be younger and sicker with a higher risk of death. Identifying and accurately describing the landscape of this current health crisis will help us take appropriate action in the future.

AB  - Drawing from social identity threat theory, which posits that stigmatized groups are attuned to situational cues that signal racial bias, we examined how African-American veterans evaluate verbal and non-verbal cues in their mental health encounters. We also explored how their evaluations of perceived racial bias might influence their healthcare engagement behaviors and communication. We interviewed 85 African-American veterans who were receiving mental health services from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), examining their views and experiences of race in healthcare. We analyzed the data using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Participants identified several identity threatening cues that include lack of racial diversity representation in healthcare settings, and perceptions of providers’ fears of Black patients. We describe how participants evaluated situational cues as identity threats, and how these cues affected their engagement behaviors and healthcare communication. Our findings revealed situational cues within clinical encounters that create for Black veterans, fear of being negatively judged based on stereotypes that have characterized African-Americans. We discuss the implications of these findings and provide suggestions on how to create identity safe environments for minority patients that include delivery of person-centered care, and organizational structures that reduce providers’ burnout.

AB  - Ineffective transitions of care continue to be a source of risk for patients. Although there has been widespread implementation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems, little is currently known about hospitalists’ and primary care providers’ (PCPs) direct communication preferences at discharge using messaging capabilities in a shared EMR system. We examined how hospitalists and PCPs with a shared EMR prefer to directly communicate at the time of hospital discharge by identifying preferred modes, information prioritization, challenges, facilitators, and proposed solutions. A sequential, explanatory mixed methods study with surveys and semi-structured interviews. Thirty-eight academic hospitalists and 63 PCPs working in outpatient clinics in a single safety net hospital system with a shared EMR. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. Interviews were analyzed using immersion/crystallization and a mixture of inductive and deductive thematic analysis. PCPs preferred direct communication at discharge through a message within the EMR while hospitalists preferred a message within the EMR and email. Qualitative results identified key themes related to patient care and direct communication: value of direct communication, safety, social determinants of health, and clinical judgment. Both groups prioritized direct communication for high-risk medications, pending and follow-up studies, and high-risk patients that hospitalists were concerned about. Overall, both hospitalists and PCPs reported that ensuring patient safety, flagging patients with social challenges, and expressing concerns about patients based on clinical judgment were key communication priorities. Hospitalists and primary care providers report considerable overlap in preferences for direct communication at the time of hospital discharge through a shared EMR. Specifically, both groups reported similar concerns regarding patient safety and continuity during transitions. Direct messaging within the EMR could enable “closed loop” communication that helps ensure safe transitions of care for high-risk patients.

AB  - Differences in mortality rates previously reported in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have increased the need for additional data on mortality and risk factors for death. We conducted this study to describe length of stay, mortality, and risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019.Observational study.Two urban, academic referral hospitals in Indianapolis, Indiana.Participants were critically ill patients 18 years old and older, admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020.None.Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. A total of 242 patients were included with mean age of 59.6 years (sd, 15.5 yr), 41.7% female and 45% African American. Mortality in the overall cohort was 19.8% and 20.5% in the mechanically ventilated subset. Patients who died were older compared with those that survived (deceased: mean age, 72.8 yr [sd, 10.6 yr] vs patients discharged alive: 54.3 yr [sd, 14.8 yr]; p < 0.001 vs still hospitalized: 59.5 yr [sd, 14.4 yr]; p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities compared with those that survived (deceased: 2 [0.5-3] vs survived: 1 [interquartile range, 0-1]; p = 0.001 vs still hospitalized: 1 [interquartile range, 0-2]; p = 0.015). Older age and end-stage renal disease were associated with increased hazard of in-hospital mortality: age 65-74 years (hazard ratio, 3.1 yr; 95% CI, 1.2-7.9 yr), age 75+ (hazard ratio, 4.1 yr; 95% CI, 1.6-10.5 yr), and end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio, 5.9 yr; 95% CI, 1.3-26.9 yr). The overall median duration of mechanical ventilation was 9.3 days (interquartile range, 5.7-13.7 d), and median ICU length of stay in those that died was 8.7 days (interquartile range, 4.0-14.9 d), compared with 9.2 days (interquartile range, 4.0-14.0 d) in those discharged alive, and 12.7 days (interquartile range, 7.2-20.3 d) in those still remaining hospitalized.Conclusions:: We found mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 to be lower than some previously reported with longer lengths of stay.

AB  - Abstract To identify knowledge gaps regarding new‐onset agitation and impulsivity prior to onset of cognitive impairment or dementia the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Syndromes (NPS) Professional Interest Area conducted a scoping review. Extending a series of reviews exploring the pre‐dementia risk syndrome Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI), we focused on late‐onset agitation and impulsivity (the MBI impulse dyscontrol domain) and risk of incident cognitive decline and dementia. This scoping review of agitation and impulsivity pre‐dementia syndromes summarizes the current biomedical literature in terms of epidemiology, diagnosis and measurement, neurobiology, neuroimaging, biomarkers, course and prognosis, treatment, and ongoing clinical trials. Validations for pre‐dementia scales such as the MBI Checklist, and incorporation into longitudinal and intervention trials, are needed to better understand impulse dyscontrol as a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

AB  - It is essential to high-quality medical care that life-sustaining treatment orders match the current, values-based preferences of patients or their surrogate decision-makers. It is unknown whether concordance between orders and current preferences is higher when a POLST form is used compared to standard documentation practices.To assess concordance between existing orders and current preferences for nursing facility residents with and without POLST forms.Chart review and interviews.Forty Indiana nursing facilities (29 where POLST is used and 11 where POLST is not in use).One hundred sixty-one residents able to provide consent and 197 surrogate decision-makers of incapacitated residents with and without POLST forms.Concordance was measured by comparing life-sustaining treatment orders in the medical record (e.g., orders about resuscitation, intubation, and hospitalization) with current preferences. Concordance was analyzed using population-averaged binary logistic regression. Inverse probability weighting techniques were used to account for non-response. We hypothesized that concordance would be higher in residents with POLST (n = 275) in comparison to residents without POLST (n = 83).Concordance was higher for residents with POLST than without POLST (59.3% versus 34.9%). In a model adjusted for resident, surrogate, and facility characteristics, the odds were 3.05 times higher that residents with POLST had orders for life-sustaining treatment match current preferences in comparison to residents without POLST (OR 3.05 95% CI 1.67-5.58, p < 0.001). No other variables were significantly associated with concordance.Nursing facility residents with POLST are significantly more likely than residents without POLST to have concordance between orders in their medical records and current preferences for life-sustaining treatments, increasing the likelihood that their treatment preferences will be known and honored. However, findings indicate further systems change and clinical training are needed to improve POLST concordance.

AB  - Significance Infection with the novel coronovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 disease. Efforts to design local, regional, and national responses to the virus are constrained by a lack of information on the extent of the epidemic as well as inaccuracies in newly developed diagnostic tests. In this study we analyze data from testing randomly selected Indiana state residents for infection or previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and derive estimates of the statewide COVID-19 prevalence in an attempt to address potential biases arising from nonresponse and diagnostic testing errors.

AB  - Rationale: Birth cohort studies have identified several temporal patterns of wheezing, only some of which are associated with asthma. Whether 17q12-21 genetic variants, which are closely associated with asthma, are also associated with childhood wheezing phenotypes remains poorly explored.Objectives: To determine whether wheezing phenotypes, defined by latent class analysis (LCA), are associated with nine 17q12-21 SNPs and if so, whether these relationships differ by race/ancestry.Methods: Data from seven U.S. birth cohorts (n = 3,786) from the CREW (Children's Respiratory Research and Environment Workgroup) were harmonized to represent whether subjects wheezed in each year of life from birth until age 11 years. LCA was then performed to identify wheeze phenotypes. Genetic associations between SNPs and wheeze phenotypes were assessed separately in European American (EA) (n = 1,308) and, for the first time, in African American (AA) (n = 620) children.Measurements and Main Results: The LCA best supported four latent classes of wheeze: infrequent, transient, late-onset, and persistent. Odds of belonging to any of the three wheezing classes (vs. infrequent) increased with the risk alleles for multiple SNPs in EA children. Only one SNP, rs2305480, showed increased odds of belonging to any wheezing class in both AA and EA children.Conclusions: These results indicate that 17q12-21 is a "wheezing locus," and this association may reflect an early life susceptibility to respiratory viruses common to all wheezing children. Which children will have their symptoms remit or reoccur during childhood may be independent of the influence of rs2305480.

AB  - <h3>PURPOSE</h3> We undertook a study to identify conditions and operational changes linked to improvements in smoking and blood pressure (BP) outcomes in primary care. <h3>METHODS</h3> We purposively sampled and interviewed practice staff (eg, office managers, clinicians) from a subset of 104 practices participating in EvidenceNOW—a multisite cardiovascular disease prevention initiative. We calculated Clinical Quality Measure improvements, with targets of 10-point or greater absolute improvements in the proportion of patients with smoking screening and, if relevant, counseling and in the proportion of hypertensive patients with adequately controlled BP. We analyzed interview data to identify operational changes, transforming these into numeric data. We used Configurational Comparative Methods to assess the joint effects of multiple factors on outcomes. <h3>RESULTS</h3> In clinician-owned practices, implementing a workflow to routinely screen, counsel, and connect patients to smoking cessation resources, or implementing a documentation change or a referral to a resource alone led to an improvement of at least 10 points in the smoking outcome with a moderate level of facilitation support. These patterns did not manifest in health- or hospital system–owned practices or in Federally Qualified Health Centers, however. The BP outcome improved by at least 10 points among solo practices after medical assistants were trained to take an accurate BP. Among larger, clinician-owned practices, BP outcomes improved when practices implemented a second BP measurement when the first was elevated, and when staff learned where to document this information in the electronic health record. With 50 hours or more of facilitation, BP outcomes improved among larger and health- and hospital system–owned practices that implemented these operational changes. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> There was no magic bullet for improving smoking or BP outcomes. Multiple combinations of operational changes led to improvements, but only in specific contexts of practice size and ownership, or dose of external facilitation.

AB  - Patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, an hereditary disorder of the connective tissue, often face a long and difficult diagnostic odyssey in pursuit of a name for their condition. Clinicians may dismiss subjective symptoms of chronic pain, thus prolonging patients' odysseys and worsening their care and satisfaction and creating antagonisms in the patient-provider relationship. A greater understanding of patient experiences is necessary in order to decrease burdens of this relationship and to improve care. To that end, we conducted 22 in-depth, semistructured interviews with individuals who had undergone this diagnostic odyssey. We focused on the impact that the odyssey had on their lives, both inside and outside the clinic. Through narrative analysis, we found a sort of "hero's journey" in the description of their cases, highlighting issues of uncertainty and integration as well as honoring their struggles. Interviewees had encountered difficulties in working with clinicians, in multiplying symptoms, and in negative psychosocial consequences. Attention to patients' lived experience may help to build empathy and understanding for the difficult and complex clinical situation presented by Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Using the hero's journey as a lens onto this experience allows for a more patient-centered approach to this understanding and has potential value for comprehension of other complex diseases and invisible illnesses.

AB  - ObjectivesThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with cases of refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) sometimes requiring support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Bivalirudin can be used for anticoagulation in patients on ECMO support, but its efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. The authors set out to compare the pharmacologic characteristics and dosing requirements of bivalirudin in patients requiring ECMO support for ARDS due to COVID-19 versus ARDS from other etiologies.Design and SettingThis retrospective case-control study was performed at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana.ParticipantsPatients were included if they were on venovenous ECMO support between June 2019 and June 2020, and divided into two groups: ARDS secondary to COVID-19 and those with ARDS from another etiology (Non-COVID).InterventionsPatient demographics, such as age, sex, weight, chronic comorbid conditions, baseline antiplatelet and anticoagulant use, antiplatelet use during ECMO, and need for renal replacement therapy were collected, and compared between groups. Time to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal, percentage of time at aPTT goal, bivalirudin rates, total bivalirudin requirements, total duration on bivalirudin, total duration on ECMO, mortality, and complications associated with ECMO were collected and compared between groups.Measurements and Main ResultsA total of 42 patients met inclusion criteria (n = 19 COVID-19, n = 23 non-COVID). However, percentages of aPTTs at goal were maintained more consistently in patients with COVID-19 versus non-COVID (86% v 74%: p < 0.01). Higher median (IQR) daily rates (3.1 μg/kg/min [2.3-5.2] v 2.4 μg/kg/min [1.7-3.3]: p = 0.05) and higher median (IQR) maximum rates of bivalirudin (5 μg/kg/min [3.7-7.5] v 3.8 μg/kg/min [2.5-5]: p = 0.03) were required in the COVID-19 group versus the non-COVID group. Time to goal aPTT was similar between groups. There were no differences in complications associated with anticoagulation, as demonstrated by similar rates of bleeding and thrombosis between both groups.ConclusionsPatients on ECMO with ARDS from COVID-19 require more bivalirudin overall and higher rates of bivalirudin to maintain goal aPTTs compared with patients without COVID-19. However, COVID-19 patients more consistently maintain goal aPTT. Future randomized trials are needed to support efficacy and safety of bivalirudin for anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients on ECMO.

AB  - Recent SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant sublineages, including BA.4 and BA.5, may be associated with greater immune evasion and less protection against COVID-19 after vaccination.To evaluate the estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2, 3, or 4 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among immunocompetent adults during a period of BA.4 or BA.5 predominant circulation; and to evaluate the relative severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients across Omicron BA.1, BA.2 or BA.2.12.1, and BA.4 or BA.5 sublineage periods.This test-negative case-control study was conducted in 10 states with data from emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters and hospitalizations from December 16, 2021, to August 20, 2022. Participants included adults with COVID-19-like illness and molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. Data were analyzed from August 2 to September 21, 2022.mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.The outcomes of interest were COVID-19 ED or UC encounters, hospitalizations, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. VE associated with protection against medically attended COVID-19 was estimated, stratified by care setting and vaccine doses (2, 3, or 4 doses vs 0 doses as the reference group). Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, demographic and clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared across sublineage periods.During the BA.4 and BA.5 predominant period, there were 82 229 eligible ED and UC encounters among patients with COVID-19-like illness (median [IQR] age, 51 [33-70] years; 49 682 [60.4%] female patients), and 19 114 patients (23.2%) had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2; among 21 007 hospitalized patients (median [IQR] age, 71 [58-81] years; 11 209 [53.4%] female patients), 3583 (17.1 %) had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated VE against hospitalization was 25% (95% CI, 17%-32%) for receipt of 2 vaccine doses at 150 days or more after receipt, 68% (95% CI, 50%-80%) for a third dose 7 to 119 days after receipt, and 36% (95% CI, 29%-42%) for a third dose 120 days or more (median [IQR], 235 [204-262] days) after receipt. Among patients aged 65 years or older who had received a fourth vaccine dose, VE was 66% (95% CI, 53%-75%) at 7 to 59 days after vaccination and 57% (95% CI, 44%-66%) at 60 days or more (median [IQR], 88 [75-105] days) after vaccination. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, ICU admission or in-hospital death occurred in 21.4% of patients during the BA.1 period vs 14.7% during the BA.4 and BA.5 period (standardized mean difference: 0.17).In this case-control study of COVID-19 vaccines and illness, VE associated with protection against medically attended COVID-19 illness was lower with increasing time since last dose; estimated VE was higher after receipt of 1 or 2 booster doses compared with a primary series alone.

AB  - Understanding consumer initiation of shared decision making (SDM) is critical to improving SDM in mental health consultations, particularly because providers do not always invite consumer participation in treatment decisions. This study examined the association between consumer initiation of nine elements of SDM as measured by the SDM scale, and measures of consumer illness self-management and the consumer-provider relationship. In 63 mental health visits, three SDM elements were associated with self-management or relationship factors: discussion of consumer goals, treatment alternatives, and pros and cons of a decision. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed.

AB  - To compare a limited array of chewing-stimulated saliva features (salivary flow, pH and buffer capacity) in a sample of elderly Mexicans with clinical, sociodemographic and socio-economic variables.A cross-sectional study was carried out in 139 adults, 60 years old and older, from two retirement homes and a senior day care centre in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. Sociodemographic, socio-economic and behavioural variables were collected through a questionnaire. A trained and standardized examiner obtained the oral clinical variables. Chewing-stimulated saliva (paraffin method) was collected and the salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity were measured. The analysis was performed using non-parametric tests in Stata 9.0.Mean age was 79.1 ± 9.8 years. Most of the subjects included were women (69.1%). Mean chewing-stimulated salivary flow was 0.75 ± 0.80 mL/minute, and the pH and buffer capacity were 7.88 ± 0.83 and 4.20 ± 1.24, respectively. Mean chewing-stimulated salivary flow varied (p < 0.05) across type of retirement home, tooth brushing frequency, number of missing teeth and use of dental prostheses. pH varied across the type of retirement home (p < 0.05) and marginally by age (p = 0.087); buffer capacity (p < 0.05) varied across type of retirement home, tobacco consumption and the number of missing teeth.These exploratory data add to the body of knowledge with regard to chewing-stimulated salivary features (salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity) and outline the variability of those features across selected sociodemographic, socio-economic and behavioural variables in a group of Mexican elders.

AB  - Objective To comparatively examine the effects of adiposity on the levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) in young black and white children. Study design We prospectively assessed 248 black and 345 white children and adolescents. A novel analytical technique was used to assess the concurrent influences of age and body mass index (BMI) on PRA, PAC, and ARR. The estimated effects were depicted by colored contour plots. Results In contrast to whites, blacks had lower PRA (2.76 vs 3.36 ng/mL/h; P < .001) and lower PAC (9.01 vs 14.59 ng/dL; P < .001). In blacks, BMI was negatively associated with PRA (P = .001), consistent with an association with a more expanded plasma volume; there was no association with PAC. In whites, BMI was positively associated with PAC (P = .005); we did not detect a BMI-PRA association. The effects of BMI on ARR were directionally similar in the two race groups but more pronounced in blacks. Mean systolic blood pressure was greater in blacks with lower PRA (P < .01), higher PAC (P = .015), and higher ARR (P = .49). Conclusions An increase in adiposity was associated with a suppressed PRA in blacks and an increase in PAC in whites. The unique relationship between adiposity and renin-aldosterone axis in blacks suggests the possible existence of a population-specific mechanism characterized by volume expansion, which could in turn enhance the influences of adiposity on blood pressure in black children and adolescents.

AB  - Telemedicine is increasinglyused fordiseasemonitoringandmanagement of chronic medical and mental disorders, but also has screening and diagnostic applications such as teleradiology and teledermatology. Indeed, “therapy at a distance” will complement office-based care in the 21st century. Another screening application is teleophthalmology, in which digital photography with telemedicine links has proven cost-effective for retinal disorders, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.1,2 Ina recent study in JAMAOphthalmology, Chasanetal3 complementedpriorcost-effectivenessanalysesof teleretinal screeningprogramsbyexaminingboth theaccuracyofdiabetic teleretinal screening as well as the subsequent eye care use and resources required in such a program. Regarding accuracy, screening tests that have good sensitivity and specificity are likely to bemore cost-effective. Regarding resource use, implementation of screening generates more referrals, testing, and procedures. The cost-effectiveness of any screening program is therefore contingent on reasonable test accuracy coupledwith a sufficient supply of resources tomeet the increased demand. Chasan et al3 conducted the study in community-based clinics ofasingleVeteransAffairs (VA)medical center.Of 1935patientswho underwent diabetic retinal screening, 465 (24%) had an abnormal finding on the retinal photograph and were referred to the VA eye clinic, of whom 326 were seen by an eye specialist and had a confirmatorydiagnosis.Themostcommonreasonsfor referralwerenonmacular diabetic retinopathy (43.2%), nerve-related disease (30.8%), lensormediaopacity (19.1%), age-relatedmacular degeneration (12.9%), and diabetic macular edema (5.6%). The percentageof agreementbetween retinal screeningand theophthalmicexamination for all diagnoseswas 90.4%,with a sensitivity of 73.6%. Sensitivity may have been somewhat inflated for 2 reasons. First, onlypatientswithabnormal retinalphotographswere referred, thus greatly increasing the number of cases with disease and minimizing thenumberof caseswithoutdisease. This verificationbias (also known as “workup bias” or “referral bias”) is a type of measurementbias inwhich the resultsof adiagnostic test affectwhether the gold standard procedure is used to verify the test result.

AB  - Objective To investigate the psychometric properties of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4) obtained by self-report in a large sample of active duty military personnel with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design Consecutive cohort who completed the MPAI-4 as a part of a larger battery of clinical outcome measures at the time of intake to an outpatient brain injury clinic. Setting Medical center. Participants Consecutively referred sample of active duty military personnel (N=404) who suffered predominantly mild (n=355), but also moderate (n=37) and severe (n=12), TBI. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure MPAI-4 Results Initial factor analysis suggested 2 salient dimensions. In subsequent analysis, the ratio of the first and second eigenvalues (6.84:1) and parallel analysis indicated sufficient unidimensionality in 26 retained items. Iterative Rasch analysis resulted in the rescaling of the measure and the removal of 5 additional items for poor fit. The items of the final 21-item Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-military were locally independent, demonstrated monotonically increasing responses, adequately fit the item response model, and permitted the identification of nearly 5 statistically distinct levels of disability in the study population. Slight mistargeting of the population resulted in the global outcome, as measured by the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-military, tending to be less reflective of very mild levels of disability. Conclusions These data collected in a relatively large sample of active duty service members with TBI provide insight into the ability of patients to self-report functional impairment and the distinct effects of military deployment on outcome, providing important guidance for the meaningful measurement of outcome in this population.

AB  - Objective Individual users' attitudes and opinions help predict successful adoption of health information technology (HIT) into practice; however, little is known about pediatric users' acceptance of HIT for medical decision-making at the point of care. Materials and methods We wished to examine the attitudes and opinions of pediatric users' toward the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system, a computer decision support system linked to an electronic health record in four community pediatric clinics. Surveys were administered in 2011 and 2012 to all users to measure CHICA's acceptability and users' satisfaction with it. Free text comments were analyzed for themes to understand areas of potential technical refinement. Results 70 participants completed the survey in 2011 (100% response rate) and 64 of 66 (97% response rate) in 2012. Initially, satisfaction with CHICA was mixed. In general, users felt the system held promise; however various critiques reflected difficulties understanding integrated technical aspects of how CHICA worked, as well as concern with the format and wording on generated forms for families and users. In the subsequent year, users' ratings reflected improved satisfaction and acceptance. Comments also reflected a deeper understanding of the system's logic, often accompanied by suggestions on potential refinements to make CHICA more useful at the point of care. Conclusions Pediatric users appreciate the system's automation and enhancements that allow relevant and meaningful clinical data to be accessible at point of care. Understanding users' acceptability and satisfaction is critical for ongoing refinement of HIT to ensure successful adoption into practice.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of preference for hospice care and explore whether the effect of these predictors on preference for hospice care were moderated by race.An analysis of the North Carolina AARP End of Life Survey (N = 3035) was conducted using multinomial logistic modeling to identify predictors of preference for hospice care. Response options included yes, no, or don't know.Fewer black respondents reported a preference for hospice (63.8% vs 79.2% for white respondents, P < .001). While the proportion of black and white respondents expressing a clear preference against hospice was nearly equal (4.5% and 4.0%, respectively), black individuals were nearly twice as likely to report a preference of "don't know" (31.5% vs 16.8%). Gender, race, age, income, knowledge of Medicare coverage of hospice, presence of an advance directive, end-of-life care concerns, and religiosity/spirituality predicted hospice care preference. Religiosity/spirituality however, was moderated by race. Race interacted with religiosity/spirituality in predicting hospice care preference such that religiosity/spirituality promoted hospice care preference among White respondents, but not black respondents.Uncertainties about hospice among African Americans may contribute to disparities in utilization. Efforts to improve access to hospice should consider pre-existing preferences for end-of-life care and account for the complex demographic, social, and cultural factors that help shape these preferences.

AB  - Event notifications are real-time, electronic, automatic alerts to providers of their patients' health care encounters at other facilities. Our objective was to examine the effects of organizational capability and related social/organizational issues upon users' perceptions of the impact of event notifications on quality, efficiency, and satisfaction.We surveyed representatives (n = 49) of 10 organizations subscribing to the Bronx Regional Health Information Organization's event notification services about organizational capabilities, notification information quality, perceived usage, perceived impact, and organizational and respondent characteristics. The response rate was 89%. Average item scores were used to create an individual domain summary score. The association between the impact of event notifications and organizational characteristics was modeled using random-intercept logistic regression models.Respondents estimated that organizations followed up on the majority (83%) of event notifications. Supportive organizational policies were associated with the perception that event notifications improved quality of care (odds ratio [OR] = 2.12; 95% CI, = 1.05, 4.45), efficiency (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.00, 4.21), and patient satisfaction (OR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.13, 5.81). Higher quality of event notification information was also associated with a perceived positive impact on quality of care (OR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.31, 6.12), efficiency (OR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.38, 6.69), and patient satisfaction (OR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.25, 7.03).Health care organizations with appropriate processes, workflows, and staff may be better positioned to use event notifications. Additionally, information quality remains critical in users' assessments and perceptions.

AB  - Purpose of the study The study objective was to understand providers' perceptions regarding identifying and treating older adults with delirium, a common complication of acute illness in persons with dementia, in the pre-hospital and emergency department environments. Design and methods The authors conducted structured focus group interviews with separate groups of emergency medical services staff, emergency nurses, and emergency physicians. Recordings of each session were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes with representative supporting quotations identified. Results Providers shared that the busy emergency department environment was the largest challenge to delirium recognition and treatment. When describing delirium, participants frequently detailed hyperactive features of delirium, rather than hypoactive features. Participants shared that they employed no clear diagnostic strategy for identifying the condition and that they used heterogeneous approaches to treat the condition. To improve care for older adults with delirium, emergency nurses identified the need for more training around the management of the condition. Emergency medical services providers identified the need for more support in managing agitated patients when in transport to the hospital and more guidance from emergency physicians on what information to collect from the patient's home environment. Emergency physicians felt that delirium care would be improved if they could have baseline mental status data on their patients and if they had access to a simple, accurate diagnostic tool for the condition. Implications Emergency medical services providers, emergency nurses, and emergency physicians frequently encounter delirious patients, but do not employ clear diagnostic strategies for identifying the condition and have varying levels of comfort in managing the condition. Clear steps should be taken to improve delirium care in the emergency department including the development of mechanisms to communicate patients' baseline mental status, the adoption of a systematized approach to recognizing delirium, and the institution of a standardized method to treat the condition when identified.

AB  - Evidence indicates that the largest volume of hospital readmissions occurs among patients with preexisting chronic conditions. Identifying these patients can improve the way hospital care is delivered and prioritize the allocation of interventions. In this retrospective study, we identify factors associated with readmission within 30 days based on claims and administrative data of nine hospitals from 2005 to 2012. We present a data inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazards extension are used to estimate the readmission risk for 4 chronic conditions (congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], acute myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes) and pneumonia, known to be related to high readmission rates. Accumulated number of admissions and discharge disposition were identified to be significant factors across most disease groups. Larger odds of readmission were associated with higher severity index for CHF and COPD patients. Different chronic conditions are associated with different patient and case severity factors, suggesting that further studies in readmission should consider studying conditions separately.

AB  - ABSTRACT As adolescents gain freedom to explore new environments unsupervised, more time in proximity to alcohol outlets may increase risks for alcohol and marijuana use. This pilot study: 1) Describes variations in adolescents' proximity to outlets by time of day and day of the week, 2) Examines variations in outlet proximity by drinking and marijuana use status, and 3) Tests feasibility of obtaining real‐time data to study adolescent proximity to outlets. U.S. adolescents (N = 18) aged 16–17 (50% female) carried GPS‐enabled smartphones for one week with their locations tracked. The geographic areas where adolescents spend time, activity spaces, were created by connecting GPS points sequentially and adding spatial buffers around routes. Proximity to outlets was greater during after school and evening hours. Drinkers and marijuana users were in proximity to outlets 1½ to 2 times more than non‐users. Findings provide information about where adolescents spend time and times of greatest risk, informing prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract Background Patient-provider electronic communication has proliferated in recent years, yet there is a dearth of published research either leading to, or including, recommendations that improve clinical care and prevent unintended negative consequences. We critically appraise published guidelines and suggest an agenda for future work in this area. Objective To understand how existing guidelines align with current practice, evidence, and technology. Methods We performed a narrative review of provider-targeted guidelines for electronic communication between patients and providers, searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed databases using relevant terms. We limited the search to articles published in English, and manually searched the citations of relevant articles. For each article, we identified and evaluated the suggested practices. Results Across 11 identified guidelines, the primary focus was on technical and administrative concerns, rather than on relational communication. Some of the security practices recommended by the guidelines are no longer needed because of shifts in technology. It is unclear the extent to which the recommendations that are still relevant are being followed. Moreover, there is no guideline-cited evidence of the effectiveness of the practices that have been proposed. Conclusion Our analysis revealed major weaknesses in current guidelines for electronic communication between patients and providers: the guidelines appear to be based on minimal evidence and offer little guidance on how best to use electronic tools to communicate effectively. Further work is needed to systematically evaluate and identify effective practices, create a framework to evaluate quality of communication, and assess the relationship between electronic communication and quality of care.

AB  - The need to reduce burdensome and costly hospitalizations of frail nursing home residents is well documented. The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project achieved this reduction through a multicomponent collaborative care model. We conducted an implementation-focused project evaluation to describe stakeholders’ perspectives on (a) the most and least effective components of the intervention; (b) barriers to implementation; and (c) program features that promoted its adoption. Nineteen nursing homes participated in OPTIMISTIC. We conducted semistructured, qualitative interviews with 63 stakeholders: 23 nursing home staff and leaders, 4 primary care providers, 10 family members, and 26 OPTIMISTIC clinical staff. We used directed content analysis to analyze the data. We found universal endorsement of the value of in-depth advance care planning (ACP) discussions in reducing hospitalizations and improving care. Similarly, all stakeholder groups emphasized that nursing home access to specially trained, project registered nurses (RNs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) with time to focus on ACP, comprehensive resident assessment, and staff education was particularly valuable in identifying residents’ goals for care. Challenges to implementation included inadequately trained facility staff and resistance to changing practice. In addition, the program sometimes failed to communicate its goals and activities clearly, leaving facilities uncertain about the OPTIMISTIC clinical staff’s roles in the facilities. These findings are important for dissemination efforts related to the OPTIMISTIC care model and may be applicable to other innovations in nursing homes.

AB  - Despite major efforts to control their spread, reported sexually transmitted infections (STI) are increasing. Using data from a mid-sized Midwest metropolitan area, we examined the settings in which individuals are tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in relation to demographics and test result to determine where interventions may best be focused.A deidentified and integrated registry, containing records from all patients tested for an STI from 2003 to 2014, was created by combining data from a large health information exchange and the reporting district's STI Program located in Indianapolis, IN. Individual characteristics and visit settings where gonorrhea and chlamydia testing was performed were analyzed.We identified 298,946 individuals with 1,062,369 visits where testing occurred at least once between the ages of 13 and 44 years. Females were tested significantly more often than males and received testing more often in outpatient clinics whereas males were most often tested in the STI clinic. Individuals who used both STI and non-STI settings were more likely to have a positive test at an STI or emergency department visit (6.4-20.8%) than outpatient or inpatient setting (0.0-11.3%) (P < 0.0001). Test visits increased over the study period particularly in emergency departments, which showed a substantial increase in the number of positive test visits.The most frequent testing sites remain STI clinics for men and outpatient clinics for women. Yet, emergency departments (ED) are increasingly a source of testing and morbidity. This makes them a valuable target for public health interventions that could improve care and population health.

AB  - Background: Tramadol and codeine are metabolized by CYP2D6 and are subject to drug–gene and drug–drug interactions. Methods: This interim analysis examined prescribing behavior and efficacy in 102 individuals prescribed tramadol or codeine while receiving pharmaco-genotyping as part of the INGENIOUS trial (NCT02297126). Results: Within 60 days of receiving tramadol or codeine, clinicians more frequently prescribed an alternative opioid in ultrarapid and poor metabolizers (odds ratio: 19.0; 95% CI: 2.8–160.4) as compared with normal or indeterminate metabolizers (p = 0.01). After adjusting the CYP2D6 activity score for drug–drug interactions, uncontrolled pain was reported more frequently in individuals with reduced CYP2D6 activity (odds ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.25–0.94). Conclusion: Phenoconversion for drug–drug and drug–gene interactions is an important consideration in pharmacogenomic implementation; drug–drug interactions may obscure the potential benefits of genotyping.

AB  - HPV vaccine is effective in preventing several cancers and anogenital warts, yet rates of HPV vaccination series completion in the United States are low. A primary reason identified by parents for vaccinating children against HPV is a health care provider's recommendation. Although most clinicians embrace vaccine recommendations, they are not always carried out evenly and subsequent HPV vaccines are missed.Using an electronic health records-based decision support system (CHICA) clinicians were randomized to either usual practice or to receive an automated reminder to recommend the 2nd or 3rd dose of HPV vaccine. The reminder was delivered to clinicians of all intervention group eligible adolescents who had already initiated the vaccine series. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis.A total of 1285 clinical encounters were observed across 29 randomized pediatric providers over a 13-month time frame (50.7% control group, 49.3% intervention group). Overall, patients were 44.9% female, 59.4% Black, 22.1% Hispanic, and 48.8% were ages 11-12 yrs. Within the control group, 421 (64.7%) received a subsequent HPV vaccine, compared to 481 (75.9%) (OR: 1.72, (95% CI 1.35-2.19)). Adjusted analysis showed no difference between the groups (aOR 1.52 (95% CI 0.88-2.62)) or when examined by age (11-12yrs aOR 1.66, (95% CI 0.79-3.48)) and 13-17yrs (aOR 1.19, (95% CI 0.76-1.85)) or gender female (aOR 1.39 (95% CI 0.71-2.72)) and males (aOR 1.67 (95% CI 0.95-2.92)). When results were stratified by both age and gender, there was similarly no statistically significant effect between the two groups.Automated physician reminders for subsequent 2nd and 3rd doses of HPV vaccination were used. Despite increased rates of vaccination in the intervention group, the differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. Future studies with multifaceted approaches may be needed to examine the efficacy of computer-based reminders.NCT02558803, "HPV Vaccination: Evaluation of Reminder Prompts for Doses 2 & 3".

AB  - Abstract Background A pharmacogenomic clinical decision support tool (PGx-CDS) for thiopurine medications can help physicians incorporate pharmacogenomic results into prescribing decisions by providing up-to-date, real-time decision support. However, the PGx-CDS user interface may introduce errors and promote alert fatigue. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a prototype of a PGx-CDS user interface for thiopurine medications with user-centered design methods. Methods This study had two phases: In phase I, we conducted qualitative interviews to assess providers’ information needs. Interview transcripts were analyzed through a combination of inductive and deductive qualitative analysis to develop design requirements for a PGx-CDS user interface. Using these requirements, we developed a user interface prototype and evaluated its usability (phase II). Results In total, 14 providers participated: 10 were interviewed in phase I, and seven providers completed usability testing in phase II (3 providers participated in both phases). Most (90%) participants were interested in PGx-CDS systems to help improve medication efficacy and patient safety. Interviews yielded 11 themes sorted into two main categories: 1) health care providers’ views on PGx-CDS and 2) important design features for PGx-CDS. We organized these findings into guidance for PGx-CDS content and display. Usability testing of the PGx-CDS prototype showed high provider satisfaction. Conclusion This is one of the first studies to utilize a user-centered design approach to develop and assess a PGx-CDS interface prototype for Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT). This study provides guidance for the development of a PGx-CDS, and particularly for biomarkers such as TPMT.

AB  - Introduction: Institutions have developed professionalism policies to help guide physician social media behavior in light of professionalism lapses that have resulted in serious consequences. Prior research has gathered perspectives on online professionalism; however, the public’s views remain poorly understood. Importantly, the impact of physician social media behavior on patient trust is unknown. Methods: To determine whether patients’ trust might change based on their physicians’ social media behavior, we conducted a cross-sectional survey across three U.S. cities (n = 491). The survey assessed patient trust using hypothetical scenarios. Results: Most respondents reported they would have less trust if their physician posted racist comments online, wrote a disrespectful patient narrative, appeared intoxicated in a photograph, or wrote profanity. Respondent age and education impacted change in trust. Conclusions: We conclude that physicians’ social media behavior may affect patient trust. Better understanding of how physicians’ online presence impacts their relationships with patients can help guide policy and inform educational efforts.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of recurrent vascular events. Timely management can reduce that risk by 70%; however, gaps in TIA quality of care exist. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the performance of the Protocol-Guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurological Symptoms (PREVENT) intervention to improve TIA quality of care. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This nonrandomized cluster trial with matched controls evaluated a multicomponent intervention to improve TIA quality of care at 6 diverse medical centers in 6 geographically diverse states in the US and assessed change over time in quality of care among 36 matched control sites (6 control sites matched to each PREVENT site on TIA patient volume, facility complexity, and quality of care). The study period (defined as the data period) started on August 21, 2015, and extended to May 12, 2019, including 1-year baseline and active implementation periods for each site. The intervention targeted clinical teams caring for patients with TIA. <h3>Intervention</h3> The quality improvement (QI) intervention included the following 5 components: clinical programs, data feedback, professional education, electronic health record tools, and QI support. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was the without-fail rate, which was calculated as the proportion of veterans with TIA at a specific facility who received all 7 guideline-recommended processes of care for which they were eligible (ie, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antithrombotic use, brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, high- or moderate-potency statin therapy, hypertension control, and neurological consultation). Generalized mixed-effects models with multilevel hierarchical random effects were constructed to evaluate the intervention associations with the change in the mean without-fail rate from the 1-year baseline period to the 1-year intervention period. <h3>Results</h3> Six facilities implemented the PREVENT QI intervention, and 36 facilities were identified as matched control sites. The mean (SD) age of patients at baseline was 69.85 (11.19) years at PREVENT sites and 71.66 (11.29) years at matched control sites. Most patients were male (95.1% [154 of 162] at PREVENT sites and 94.6% [920 of 973] at matched control sites at baseline). Among the PREVENT sites, the mean without-fail rate improved substantially from 36.7% (58 of 158 patients) at baseline to 54.0% (95 of 176 patients) during a 1-year implementation period (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.27-3.48;<i>P</i> = .004). Comparing the change in quality at the PREVENT sites with the matched control sites, the improvement in the mean without-fail rate was greater at the PREVENT sites than at the matched control sites (36.7% [58 of 158 patients] to 54.0% [95 of 176 patients] [17.3% absolute improvement] vs 38.6% [345 of 893 patients] to 41.8% [363 of 869 patients] [3.2% absolute improvement], respectively; absolute difference, 14%;<i>P</i> = .008). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> The implementation of this multifaceted program was associated with improved TIA quality of care across the participating sites. The PREVENT QI program is an example of a health care system using QI strategies to improve performance, and may serve as a model for other health systems seeking to provide better care. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02769338

AB  - Abstract Background Caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD) report high levels of distress, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, caregiving burden, and existential suffering; however, those with support and healthy coping strategies have less stress and burden. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) aims to foster greater acceptance of internal events while promoting actions aligned with personal values to increase psychological flexibility in the face of challenges. The objective of this single-arm pilot, Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Caregivers (TACTICs), was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an ACT intervention on ADRD caregiver anxiety, depressive symptoms, burden, caregiver suffering, and psychological flexibility. Methods ADRD caregivers ≥21 years of age with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) score ≥ 10 indicative of moderate or higher symptoms of anxiety were enrolled ( N = 15). Participants received a telephone-based ACT intervention delivered by a non-licensed, bachelor’s-prepared trained interventionist over 6 weekly 1-h sessions that included engaging experiential exercises and metaphors designed to increase psychological flexibility. The following outcome measures were administered at baseline (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2), 3 months post-intervention (T3), and 6 months post-intervention (T4): anxiety symptoms (GAD-7; primary outcome); secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire–9), burden (Zarit Burden Interview), suffering (The Experience of Suffering measure), psychological flexibility/experiential avoidance (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II), and coping skills (Brief COPE). Results All 15 participants completed the study and 93.3% rated their overall satisfaction with their TACTICs experience as “completely satisfied.” At T2, caregivers showed large reduction in anxiety symptoms (SRM 1.42, 95% CI [0.87, 1.97], p &lt; 0.001) that were maintained at T3 and T4. At T4, psychological suffering (SRM 0.99, 95% CI [0.41, 1.56], p = 0.0027) and caregiver burden (SRM 0.79, 95% CI [0.21, 1.37], p = 0.0113) also decreased. Conclusions Despite a small sample size, the 6-session manualized TACTICs program was effective in reducing anxiety, suggesting that non-clinically trained staff may be able to provide an effective therapeutic intervention by phone to maximize intervention scalability and reach.

AB  - Technical and interpersonal challenges of using electronic health records (EHRs) in ambulatory care persist. We use cockpit communication as an example of highly coordinated complex activity during flight and compare it with providers’ communication when computers are used in the exam room. Maximum variation sampling was used to identify two videotapes from a parent study of primary care physicians’ exam room computer demonstrating the greatest variation. We then produced and analyzed visualizations of the time providers spent looking at the computer and looking at the patient. Unlike the cockpit which is engineered to optimize joint attention on complex coordinated activities, we found polar extremes in the use of joint focus of attention to manage the medical encounter. We conclude that there is a great deal of room for improving the balance of interpersonal and technical attention that occurs in routine ambulatory visits in which computers are present in the exam room. Using well-known aviation practices can help primary care providers become more aware of the opportunities and challenges for enhancing the physician patient relationship in an era of exam room computing.

AB  - The 9-valent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, 9vHPV, was licensed in the U.S. in December, 2014. We assessed healthcare provider (HCP) awareness of the newly approved vaccine and identified questions HCPs have about the vaccine. As part of a larger study, we used semi-structured interviews to ask 22 pediatric HCPs about their awareness of 9vHPV, questions they have about the vaccine, and questions they anticipate from patients and parents. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed then analyzed using inductive content analysis. Over half were aware of the vaccine but few HCPs claimed to be familiar with it. HCPs indicated several questions with common themes pertaining to efficacy, side effects, and cost. Only half of HCPs believed patients or parents would have questions. The results suggest strategies and areas for health systems and public health organizations to target in order to resolve unmet educational needs among HCPs regarding 9vHPV.

AB  - Healthy diet and physical activity (PA) have been associated with reduced depressive symptoms, but few studies have examined them simultaneously in African Americans. To investigate fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) and PA as predictors of clinically-relevant levels of depressive symptoms (CRLDS) in African Americans. African American Health (AAH) is a population-based longitudinal study of African Americans in St. Louis, MO, who were born in 1936–1950 (inclusive) and empaneled in 2000-01 (wave 1). At wave 8, participants self-reported fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) and completed the Yale Physical Activity Scale. At both waves 8 and 10, the CES-D 11-item scale was used to identify those who met criteria for CRLDS. Sequential logistic regression modeling was used to examine the associations of components of FVI/PA with CRLDS, both cross-sectionally (n = 680, including imputed values) and longitudinally (n = 582, including imputed values). Modeling employed gender, age, perceived income adequacy, and education as potential confounders. Cross-sectionally, vigorous PA, and leisurely walking PA, were independently associated with lower odds of CRLDS in all but the fifth model and green vegetables in all models. Longitudinally, green vegetables and interactions between the FVI summary score, the PA summary score, and other factors at wave 8 were most consistently associated with CRLDS at wave 10. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, the socioeconomic variables showed the strongest association as risk factors for CRLDS. Both FVI and PA were self-reported rather than observed, our cohort had limited geographic- and age-ranges, and confidence intervals for some results were broad. Green vegetables, total FVI, and various aspects of PA showed protective effects regarding CRLDS. Therefore, the promotion of such lifestyles is likely to help prevent CRLDS in this population.

AB  - Objectives:Advance care planning (ACP) enables individuals to deliberate about future preferences for care based upon their values and beliefs about what is important in life. For many patients with advanced cancer, however, these critical conversations do not occur. A growing body of literature has examined the end-of-life wishes of seriously ill patients. Few studies have explored what is important to persons as they live with advanced cancer. The aim of the current study was to address this gap and to understand how clinicians can support patients’ efforts to live in the present and plan for the future. Methods:Transcriptions of interviews conducted with 36 patients diagnosed with advanced cancer were analyzed using immersion–crystallization, a qualitative research technique. Results:Four overarching themes were identified: (I) living in the face of death, (II) who I am, (III) my experience of cancer, and (IV) impact of my illness on others. Twelve subthemes are also reported. Significance of Results:These findings have significant implications for clinicians as they partner with patients to plan for the future. Our data suggest that clinicians consider the following 4 prompts: (1) “What is important to you now, knowing that you will die sooner than you want or expected?” (2) “Tell me about yourself.” (3) “Tell me in your own words about your experience with cancer care and treatment.” (4) “What impact has your illness had on others?” In honoring patients’ lived experiences, we may establish the mutual understanding necessary to providing high-quality care that supports patients’ priorities for life.

AB  - Opioid prescribing and subsequent rates of serious harms have dramatically increased in the past two decades, yet there are still significant barriers to reduction of risky opioid regimens. This formative evaluation utilized a mixed-methods approach to identify barriers and factors that may facilitate the successful implementation of Primary Care-Integrated Pain Support (PIPS), a clinical program designed to support the reduction of risky opioid regimens while increasing the uptake of non-pharmacologic treatment modalities.Eighteen Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees across three sites completed a survey consisting of the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) scale; a subset of these individuals (n = 9) then completed a semi-structured qualitative phone interview regarding implementing PIPS within the VA. ORIC results were analyzed using descriptive statistics while interview transcripts were coded and sorted according to qualitative themes.Quantitative analysis based on ORIC indicated high levels of organizational readiness to implement PIPS. Interview analysis revealed several salient themes: system-level barriers such as tension among various pain management providers; patient-level barriers such as perception of support and tension between patient and provider; and facilitating factors of PIPS, such as the importance of the clinical pharmacist role.While organizational readiness for implementing PIPS appears high, modifications to our implementation facilitation strategy (e.g., establishing clinical pharmacists as champions; marketing PIPS to leadership as a way to improve VA opioid safety metrics) may improve capacity of the sites to implement PIPS successfully.

AB  - Delirium affects nearly 70% of older adults hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU), and many of those will be left with persistent cognitive impairment or dementia. There are no effective and scalable recovery models to remediate ICU-acquired cognitive impairment and its attendant elevated risk for dementia or Alzheimer disease (AD). The Improving Recovery and Outcomes Every Day after the ICU (IMPROVE) trial is an ongoing clinical trial which evaluates the efficacy of a combined physical exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function among ICU survivors 50 years and older who experienced delirium during an ICU stay. This article describes the study protocol for IMPROVE. IMPROVE is a four-arm, randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomized to one of four arms: cognitive training and physical exercise; cognitive control and physical exercise; cognitive training and physical exercise control; and cognitive control and physical exercise control. Facilitators administer the physical exercise and exercise control interventions in individual and small group formats by using Internet-enabled videoconference. Cognitive training and control interventions are also facilitator led using Posit Science, Inc. online modules delivered in individual and small group format directly into the participants’ homes. Subjects complete cognitive assessment, mood questionnaires, physical performance batteries, and quality of life scales at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Blood samples will also be taken at baseline and 3 months to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase reactants; neurotrophic factors; and markers of glial dysfunction and astrocyte activation. This study is the first clinical trial to examine the efficacy of combined physical and cognitive exercise on cognitive function in older ICU survivors with delirium. The results will provide information about potential synergistic effects of a combined intervention on a range of outcomes and mechanisms of action. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03095417 .

AB  - To examine how provider report of confidential consultation in the electronic health record is associated with adolescent characteristics, health risk factors, and provider training.This prospective cohort study was conducted as part of a larger study implementing computerized clinical decision support in 2 urban primary care clinics. Adolescents used tablets to complete screening questions for specified risk factors in the waiting room. Adolescent-reported risk factors included sexual activity, substance use, and depressive symptoms. Providers were prompted on encounter forms to address identified risk factors and indicate whether confidential consultation was provided. Provider types included adolescent medicine board certified pediatrics and general pediatrics. Differences in proportions of adolescents reporting risk factors by provider type were assessed using χ2 tests. Associations between adolescent characteristics, risk factors, and provider-reported confidential consultation were examined using logistic regression analyses.The sample included 1233 English and Spanish-speaking adolescents 12-20 years of age (52% female; 60% black; 50% early adolescent). Patients seen by adolescent medicine board certified providers reported sexual activity, depressive symptoms, and substance use significantly more often than those seen by general pediatric providers. Among patients seen by board certified adolescent medicine providers, confidential consultation was provided to 90%. For those seen by general pediatric providers, confidential consultation was provided to 53%. Results of multiple logistic regression demonstrated that female sex, later adolescence, and clinic location were significantly associated with confidential consultation.Provider training is needed to reinforce the importance of confidential consultation for all adolescents.

AB  - Currently, many risk assessment tools are available for clinicians to assess a patient’s periodontal disease risk. Numerous studies demonstrate the potential of these tools to promote preventive management and reduce morbidity due to periodontal disease. Despite these promising results, solo and small group dental practices, where most people receive care, have not adopted risk assessment tools widely, primarily due to lack of studies in these settings. The objective of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of dental providers in these settings toward risk-based care through focus groups. We conducted six focus group sessions with 52 dentists and dental hygienists practicing in solo and small group practices in Pittsburgh, PA and New York City (NYC), NY. An experienced moderator and a note-taker conducted the six sessions, each including 8–10 participants and lasting approximately 90 min. All sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two researchers coded the focus group transcripts. Using a thematic analysis approach, they reviewed the coding results to identify important themes and selected representative excerpts that best described each theme. Providers strongly believed identifying risk factors could predict periodontal disease and use this information to change their patients’ behavior. A successful risk assessment tool could assist them in educating and changing their patient’s behaviors to adopt a healthy lifestyle, thus enabling them to play a major role in their patients’ overall health. However, to achieve this goal, it is essential to educate all dental providers and not just dentists on performing risk assessment and translating the results into actionable recommendations for patients. According to study participants, the research community has focused more on translating research findings into a risk assessment tool, and less on how clinicians would use these tools during patient encounters and if it affects a patients’ risk or outcome. Dental practitioners were open to performing risk assessment as routine care and playing a bigger role in their patients’ overall health. Recommendations to overcome major barriers included educating dental providers at all levels, conducting more research about their adoption and use in real-world settings and developing appropriate reimbursement models.

AB  - Abstract Objective This paper describes the unified LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook and the process by which it was produced. Methods The Regenstrief Institute and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) developed a unification plan consisting of six objectives 1) develop a unified model for radiology procedure names that represents the attributes with an extensible set of values, 2) transform existing LOINC procedure codes into the unified model representation, 3) create a mapping between all the attribute values used in the unified model as coded in LOINC (ie, LOINC Parts) and their equivalent concepts in RadLex, 4) create a mapping between the existing procedure codes in the RadLex Core Playbook and the corresponding codes in LOINC, 5) develop a single integrated governance process for managing the unified terminology, and 6) publicly distribute the terminology artifacts. Results We developed a unified model and instantiated it in a new LOINC release artifact that contains the LOINC codes and display name (ie LONG_COMMON_NAME) for each procedure, mappings between LOINC and the RSNA Playbook at the procedure code level, and connections between procedure terms and their attribute values that are expressed as LOINC Parts and RadLex IDs. We transformed all the existing LOINC content into the new model and publicly distributed it in standard releases. The organizations have also developed a joint governance process for ongoing maintenance of the terminology. Conclusions The LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook provides a universal terminology standard for radiology orders and results.

AB  - Abstract Objective Advance care planning (ACP) increases quality of life and satisfaction with care for those with cancer and their families, yet these important conversations often do not occur. Barriers include patients’ and families’ emotional responses to cancer, such as anxiety and sadness, which can lead to avoidance of discussing illness-related topics such as ACP. Interventions that address psychological barriers to ACP are needed. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of a mindfulness intervention designed to cultivate patient and caregiver emotional and relational capacity to respond to the challenges of cancer with greater ease, potentially decreasing psychological barriers to ACP and enhancing ACP engagement. Method The Mindfully Optimizing Delivery of End-of-Life (MODEL) Care intervention provided 12 hours of experiential training to two cohorts of six to seven adults with advanced-stage cancer and their family caregivers ( n = 13 dyads). Training included mindfulness practices, mindful communication skills development, and information about ACP. Patient and caregiver experiences of the MODEL Care program were assessed using semistructured interviews administered immediately postintervention and open-ended survey questions delivered immediately and at 4 weeks postintervention. Responses were analyzed using qualitative methods. Result Four salient themes were identified. Patients and caregivers reported the intervention (1) enhanced adaptive coping practices, (2) lowered emotional reactivity, (3) strengthened relationships, and (4) improved communication, including communication about their disease. Significance of results The MODEL Care intervention enhanced patient and caregiver capacity to respond to the emotional challenges that often accompany advanced cancer and decreased patient and caregiver psychological barriers to ACP.

AB  - Abstract Objective Dignity therapy (DT) is designed to address psychological and existential challenges that terminally ill individuals face. DT guides patients in developing a written legacy project in which they record and share important memories and messages with those they will leave behind. DT has been demonstrated to ease existential concerns for adults with advanced-stage cancer; however, lack of institutional resources limits wide implementation of DT in clinical practice. This study explores qualitative outcomes of an abbreviated, less resource-intensive version of DT among participants with advanced-stage cancer and their legacy project recipients. Method Qualitative methods were used to analyze postintervention interviews with 11 participants and their legacy recipients as well as the created legacy projects. Direct content analysis was used to assess feedback from the interviews about benefits, barriers, and recommendations regarding abbreviated DT. The legacy projects were coded for expression of core values. Result Findings suggest that abbreviated DT effectively promotes (1) self-expression, (2) connection with loved ones, (3) sense of purpose, and (4) continuity of self. Participants observed that leading the development of their legacy projects promoted independent reflection, autonomy, and opportunities for family interaction when reviewing and discussing the projects. Consistent with traditional DT, participants expressed “family” as the most common core value in their legacy projects. Expression of “autonomy” was also a notable finding. Significance of results Abbreviated DT reduces resource barriers to conducting traditional DT while promoting similar benefits for participants and recipients, making it a promising adaptation warranting further research. The importance that patients place on family and autonomy should be honored as much as possible by those caring for adults with advanced-stage cancer.

AB  - Clinician burnout is presumed to negatively impact healthcare quality; yet scant research has rigorously addressed this hypothesis. Using a mixed-methods, randomized, comparative effectiveness design, we tested two competing approaches to improve care—one addressing clinician burnout and the other addressing how clinicians interact with consumers—with 192 clinicians and 469 consumers at two community mental health centers. Although qualitative reports were promising, we found no comparative effectiveness for either intervention on burnout, patient-centered processes, or other outcomes. Discussion includes identifying ways to strengthen approaches to clinician burnout.

AB  - New communication technologies have shown some promise in lifestyle weight loss interventions but may be most effective when leveraging face-to-face communications. The study reported here sought to test whether weight loss programme attendance and outcomes are greater when offered in-person at community sites or remotely via videoconference vs. in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In a three-arm randomized trial among 150 FQHC adults, intervention delivery in community-sites or via videoconference was tested against a clinic-based lifestyle intervention (enhanced usual care [EUC]).Twice weekly, a nutrition topic was reviewed, and exercise sessions were held in a 20-week programme delivered either in community settings or via videoconference. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants losing more than 2 kg at 6 (end of treatment) and 12 months in intent-to-treat analyses.Mean (SD) age was 53 years, 82% were women, 65% were African-American, 50% reported $18,000 or less household income and 49% tested low in health literacy, and mean (SD) body mass index was 39 kg m-2. The proportion losing more than 2 kg of weight in the community site, videoconference and EUC groups was 33%, 34% and 24%, respectively, at 6 months and 29%, 34% and 29% at 12 months. No differences reached significance. Attendance was poor in all groups; 45% of community site, 58% of videoconference and 16% of EUC participants attended at least one session.Videoconference and community-based delivery were as effective as an FQHC-based weight loss programme.

AB  - Abstract Background Antipsychotics are prescribed to treat various symptoms in older adults, however, their safety in this context has not been fully evaluated. The objective was to evaluate mortality risks associated with off-label use of antipsychotics among older adults with no preexisting mental illness or dementia relative to those with diagnosis of dementia. Methods Data (2007–2015) were derived from Department of Veterans Affairs registries for 730,226 patients (≥65 years) with no baseline serious mental illness, dementia). We estimated the cumulative incidence of antipsychotics prescription and 10-year all-cause mortality. The extended Cox models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) associated with antipsychotics prescription, adjusted for time-varying covariates, dementia diagnosis, comorbidity index score, and age at time of first exposure to antipsychotics. Results The study included 98% males, 13% African Americans, and 81% Caucasian. Patients with dementia and antipsychotics had the highest risk of mortality (78.0%), followed by (73.0%) for patients with dementia alone and compared with patients without dementia or antipsychotics exposure who had the lowest mortality risk (42.0%). Exposure to typical antipsychotics was associated with (HR: 2.1, confidence interval [CI] 2.0–2.2) compared with atypical antipsychotics (HR: 1.5, CI 1.4–1.5, p = &amp;lt;.0001). Conclusion In a large cohort of older adults, antipsychotics were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. While significant increase in mortality was attributable to the diagnosis of dementia, the addition of antipsychotics resulted in added mortality risk among all patients. Antipsychotic medications should be used cautiously in all older adults, not only those with dementia.

AB  - Abstract Objective Enterprise health information exchange (HIE) and a single electronic health record (EHR) vendor solution are 2 information exchange approaches to improve performance and increase the quality of care. This study sought to determine the association between adoption of enterprise HIE vs a single vendor environment and changes in unplanned readmissions. Materials and Methods The association between unplanned 30-day readmissions among adult patients and adoption of enterprise HIE or a single vendor environment was measured in a panel of 211 system-member hospitals from 2010 through 2014 using fixed-effects regression models. Sample hospitals were members of health systems in 7 states. Enterprise HIE was defined as self-reported ability to exchange information with other members of the same health system who used different EHR vendors. A single EHR vendor environment reported exchanging information with other health system members, but all using the same EHR vendor. Results Enterprise HIE adoption was more common among the study sample than EHR (75% vs 24%). However, adoption of a single EHR vendor environment was associated with a 0.8% reduction in the probability of a readmission within 30 days of discharge. The estimated impact of adopting an enterprise HIE strategy on readmissions was smaller and not statically significant. Conclusion Reductions in the probability of an unplanned readmission after a hospital adopts a single vendor environment suggests that HIE technologies can better support the aim of higher quality care. Additionally, health systems may benefit more from a single vendor environment approach than attempting to foster exchange across multiple EHR vendors.

AB  - Background A lack of large-scale, individually linked data often has impeded efforts to disentangle individual-level variability in outcomes from area-level variability in studies of many diseases and conditions. This study investigated individual and county-level variability in outcomes following non-fatal overdose in a state-wide cohort of opioid overdose patients. Methods Participants were 24 031 patients treated by emergency medical services or an emergency department for opioid-involved overdose in Indiana between 2014 and 2017. Outcomes included repeat non-fatal overdose, fatal overdose and death. County-level predictors included sociodemographic, socioeconomic and treatment availability indicators. Individual-level predictors included age, race, sex and repeat non-fatal opioid-involved overdose. Multilevel models examined outcomes following non-fatal overdose as a function of patient and county characteristics. Results 10.9% (n=2612) of patients had a repeat non-fatal overdose, 2.4% (n=580) died of drug overdose and 9.2% (n=2217) died overall. Patients with a repeat overdose were over three times more likely to die of drug-related causes (OR=3.68, 99.9% CI 2.62 to 5.17, p&lt;0.001). County-level effects were limited primarily to treatment availability indicators. Higher rates of buprenorphine treatment providers were associated with lower rates of mortality (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97, p=0.024), but the opposite trend was found for naltrexone treatment providers (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.39, p=0.021). Cross-level interactions showed higher rates of Black deaths relative to White deaths in counties with high rates of naltrexone providers (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.73, p=0.019). Conclusion Although patient-level differences account for most variability in opioid-related outcomes, treatment availability may contribute to county-level differences, necessitating multifaceted approaches for the treatment and prevention of opioid abuse.

AB  - To identify whether delirium biomarkers aligned with the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework, a conceptual model that describes the use of diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias (ADRD).Systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Acute care and outpatient settings.Adults diagnosed with delirium.MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for English-language studies published from January 2010 to February 2020. Studies included adults older than 18 years, identified delirium with a standardized assessment tool, and measured an ADRD biomarker. Independent reviewers determined whether an association between delirium and ADRD biomarker was found, the quality of biomarker data based on the REMARK (REporting recommendations for tumor MARKer prognostic studies) checklist, and the study bias based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.A total of 61,256 citations were identified; 113 studies were included. Most studies did not examine amyloid, tau, or neurodegeneration biomarkers. Delirium may be associated with neurodegeneration biomarkers, but few to no studies found an association with amyloid and tau biomarkers. Delirium was not consistently associated with inflammatory biomarkers. The quality of biomarker data was moderate, and the risk of bias was moderate to high. Studies often did not collect prehospital and posthospital cognitive data.Most delirium diagnostic biomarker studies did not measure amyloid, tau, and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers, making characterization of the relationship between delirium and ADRD difficult. Future delirium biomarker diagnostic studies could improve the understanding of pathophysiologic links between delirium with other conditions affecting cognition.

AB  - Clinicians frequently stress the importance of maintaining good oral health for multiple reasons, including its link to systemic health. Because periodontal treatment reduces inflammation in oral tissues, some hypothesize it may positively affect systemic outcomes by reducing inflammation in the body. A significant number of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) have evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic outcomes. However, inconsistent findings and questionable methodological rigor make drawing conclusions difficult. We conducted a systematic review of reviews that studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment on systemic disease outcomes. We report on outcomes evaluated, categorizing them as biomarkers, and surrogate or clinical endpoints. In addition, we used A MeaSurement Tool to Access systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) to evaluate the methodological quality of the reviews. Of the 52 studies included in our review, 21 focused on diabetes, 15 on adverse birth outcomes, 8 on cardiovascular disease, 3 each on obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, and 2 on chronic kidney disease. Across all studies, surrogate endpoints predominated as outcomes, followed by biomarkers and, rarely, actual disease endpoints. Ninety-two percent of studies had "low" or "critically low" AMSTAR 2 confidence ratings. Criteria not met most frequently included advance registration of the protocol, justification for excluding individual studies, risk of bias from individual studies being included in the review, and appropriateness of meta-analytical methods. There is a dearth of robust evidence on whether nonsurgical periodontal treatment improves systemic disease outcomes. Future reviews should adhere more closely to methodological guidelines for conducting and reporting SRs/MAs than has been the case to date. Beyond improved reviews, additional rigorous research on whether periodontal treatment affects systemic health is needed. We highlight the potential of large-scale databases containing matched medical and dental record data to inform and complement future clinical research studying the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic outcomes.

AB  - Intrauterine device (IUD) expulsion increases the risk of unintended pregnancy; how timing of postpartum IUD insertion and breastfeeding are associated with risk of expulsion is relevant to the benefit-risk profile.To evaluate the association of postpartum timing of IUD insertion and breastfeeding status with incidence and risk of IUD expulsion.The Association of Perforation and Expulsion of Intrauterine Devices (APEX-IUD) cohort study included women aged 50 years or younger with an IUD insertion between 2001 and 2018. The breastfeeding analysis focused on a subcohort of women at 52 or fewer weeks post partum with known breastfeeding status. The study was conducted using data from electronic health records (EHRs) at 4 research sites with access to EHR: 3 Kaiser Permanente sites (Northern California, Southern California, Washington) and the Regenstrief Institute (Indiana). Data analysis was conducted from June to November 2019.Timing of IUD insertion post partum was categorized into discrete time periods: 0 to 3 days, 4 days to 6 or fewer weeks, more than 6 weeks to 14 or fewer weeks, more than 14 weeks to 52 or fewer weeks, and non-post partum (>52 weeks or no evidence of delivery). Breastfeeding status at the time of insertion was determined from clinical records, diagnostic codes, or questionnaires from well-baby visits.Incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were estimated using propensity scores to adjust for confounding.The full cohort included 326 658 women (mean [SD] age, 32.0 [8.3] years; 38 911 [11.9%] Asian or Pacific Islander; 696 [0.2%] Hispanic Black; 56 180 [17.2%] Hispanic other; 42 501 [13.0%] Hispanic White; 28 323 [8.7%] non-Hispanic Black; 137 102 [42.0%] non-Hispanic White), and the subcohort included 94 817 women. Most IUDs were levonorgestrel-releasing (259 234 [79.4%]). There were 8943 expulsions. The 5-year cumulative incidence of IUD expulsion was highest for insertions 0 to 3 days post partum (10.73%; 95% CI, 9.12%-12.61%) and lowest for insertions more than 6 weeks to 14 or fewer weeks post partum (3.18%; 95% CI, 2.95%-3.42%). Adjusted HRs using women with non-post partum IUD insertion as the referent were 5.34 (95% CI, 4.47-6.39) for those with postpartum insertion at 0 to 3 days; 1.22 (95% CI, 1.05-1.41) for those with postpartum insertion at 4 days to 6 or fewer weeks; 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.18) for those with postpartum insertion at more than 6 to 14 or fewer weeks; and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.29-1.60) for those with postpartum insertion at more than 14 to 52 or fewer weeks. In the subcohort, 5-year cumulative incidence was 3.49% (95% CI, 3.25%-3.73%) for breastfeeding women and 4.57% (95% CI, 4.22%-4.95%) for nonbreastfeeding women; the adjusted HR for breastfeeding vs not breastfeeding was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78).In this study of real-world data, IUD expulsion was rare but more common with immediate postpartum insertion. Breastfeeding was associated with lower expulsion risk.

AB  - Advance care planning (ACP) was initially narrowly defined as documentation of life-sustaining treatment (LST). One initial goal was to curb unwanted LSTs and costs.1 Yet, a focus solely on legal documentation of LST preferences has resulted in mixed data on goal-concordant care and healthcare utilization.2-4 Fortunately, the conceptualization of ACP continues to evolve, and is now widely recognized as a process of preparing patients (people) and surrogate decision-makers for communication and medical decision-making.5, 6 This process involves a complex array of patient, surrogate, and clinician behaviors, health systems workflows, interventions, communities, and policy. ACP is rooted in what quality of life means to people.4, 5, 7 However, antiquated narrow definitions of ACP as a one-time checkbox or code status persist, resulting in heterogeneous research, clinical, and policy initiatives.2, 4 To address this heterogeneity, a modified Delphi panel defined ACP in 2017 as “a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care.”7 As the field has evolved, this definition focused on “future decisions” has proven to be too narrow as it does not include the preparation of patients and surrogates for decision-making over the life course or address public perceptions of ACP.8-10 The use of non-standardized and potentially inappropriate ACP outcomes in research also makes it difficult to evaluate ACP's effectiveness.4, 11 Goal-concordant care has been considered the “gold standard,” but there is a lack of validated or standardized measures.12-15 Because patient preferences may change, reliance on retrospective chart review to assess goal concordance may be inaccurate,13, 14 and there is a growing consensus that surrogate outcomes should be one key focus of ACP research.6 Additionally, ACP is unlikely to affect some outcomes such as quality of life, which may be impacted by other factors such as symptom burden, available support, and so forth, or healthcare utilization, which is not patient-centered and affected by lack of healthcare access, systemic injustice, and other issues.12, 16 Furthermore, the unique needs of historically marginalized populations are not well represented in prior definitions and outcomes identification. Rates of ACP are much lower (<20%) among racially or ethnically minoritized populations and those with limited health literacy.17-19 Disparities in ACP also persist for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersexual, asexual, homeless, and incarcerated populations.20, 21 Reasons may include lack of access to healthcare, experiential discrimination, well-founded mistrust,22, 23 and culturally diverse views on autonomy and decision-making,24, 25 making it preferable for many to begin care planning discussions in their communities. Diverse communities, as well as interdisciplinary clinicians and community-based experts, have not been included in prior efforts to define ACP and ACP outcomes. We propose a new framework that reflects the updated focus on preparation for communication and medical decision-making and conceptualizes ACP as part of the continuum of care planning. The overarching construct under the “Care Planning Umbrella” focuses on preparation for communication and medical decision-making,5 with quality of life and what brings meaning and purpose as the fundamental cornerstone. Underneath this broader umbrella are multiple steps, behaviors, people, clinical and community workflows, and decisions—some of which are in-the-moment and some in advance. Care planning is shaped by the person's (or surrogate's) perceptions of quality of life; understanding that these constructs are dynamic and evolve over time.28 It is also shaped by an individual's readiness, preferences for control over decision-making, illness understanding, prognostic awareness, and views of acceptable/unacceptable tradeoffs.5 All care planning is also influenced by family and caregiver support, community social norms, accessible resources, and current policy. The Care Planning Umbrella also spans the life course as people move between healthy/chronic illness, serious illness, and the end of life. They face different types of decisions (e.g., diabetes medication regimen for chronically ill, chemotherapy for seriously ill, hospice at end of life), and receive care in different settings (e.g., community, outpatient, acute care, long-term care, hospice).5, 29 Care planning must be tailored to the individual's life course, the decisions they are facing, and based on what quality of life means to the person at that time. For example, although surrogate designation and the integration of quality of life into medical decision-making is appropriate at every life stage, the appropriateness of integrating prognostic awareness and tradeoffs will vary (Figure 1).30, 31 At all life stages, some decisions may be in-the-moment (e.g., diabetes treatment, chemotherapy, end-of-life procedures) and some may be in advance (e.g., designation of a surrogate, care setting preferences). Over the life course, the lines between in-the-moment and advanced decisions may be fluid.3, 30, 31 Furthermore, some people, even early in the life course, may have strong and enduring preferences about their future medical care based on personal experiences and beliefs. Those individuals should be given the opportunity to discuss and document those preferences while educating them and their surrogate decision-makers that their preferences may change over time and should be revisited. The onus is on our field to disentangle the complexity of ACP (i.e., care planning) as patients and caregivers desire ACP and studies show ACP decreases surrogate distress.4 Based on recent consensus, more clinically meaningful outcomes from the patient and caregiver perspective may include surrogate burden and distress; feeling heard and understood; and satisfaction with care, communication, and decision-making.4, 6 In addition, implementation science and human factors engineering can be used to help care planning achieve its next step in the evolutionary process. Implementation science offers tools to understand complex processes, including determining the strategies and outcomes that meet the needs of culturally diverse patients and their families.32 System-level strategic approaches that consider organizational and community factors are preferred over examination of individual components (e.g., individual interventions or clinicians).2, 4, 33-35 The recently updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a well-established framework for implementing evidence-based interventions in real-world settings.36, 37 CFIR provides a guide for systematically identifying implementation factors that determine whether ACP (i.e., care planning) programs or tools succeed or fail. CFIR also recognizes that barriers may arise at any level or setting and can be used to identify strategies to overcome barriers. CFIR consists of five, interrelated domains that can guide care planning research (see Table 1 and Supplemental figure [Appendix S1]): Outer Setting (e.g., cultural/social norms, systemic racism, policies and laws, health information exchanges, quality metrics, reimbursement, etc.); Inner Setting (e.g., healthcare system readiness and workflows, policies, incentives, EMR infrastructure); Individuals (e.g., disease trajectory; cultural backgrounds; experiential racism and mistrust influenced by Capacity, Opportunity, and Motivation (COM-B)38); Innovation (e.g., design for patients and caregivers: educational modalities; documentation; community navigators; community events, medical-legal partnerships, etc. and clinicians and staff: clinician training protocols; conversation guides; electronic medical record (EMR) templates, etc.); and Implementation Process39, 40 (e.g., degree to which there is collaboration across leadership, multidisciplinary teams, settings; organizational champions; clinician buy-in; process to identify appropriate populations; messaging and marketing, and quality improvement, etc.). Advance care planning (ACP) design: How assembled and presented For patients and caregivers: For clinicians and staff: Structural characteristics Relational Connections/Communication Culture Innovation recipient (e.g., patients, caregivers, clinicians): Based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation (COM-B) Model for Behavior Change Human factors engineering methods are applied to understand how people engage in complex processes to improve system design and outcomes and can play a role in understanding and improving care planning.41 Process mapping can be used to visualize relevant care planning workflows and tasks of diverse parties (e.g., interdisciplinary clinicians, patients, surrogates, community members, faith leaders, attorneys, etc.) using multiple, iterative steps. Integrating process mapping and the CFIR model can ensure a complete understanding of the systems and processes involved. Care planning will likely require multiple process maps to fully reflect the complexity of diverse parties, settings, patients' stage on the life course, and components and factors necessary for patient-centered care. Care planning implementation requires a broad range of community partners that extends well beyond the healthcare setting to where people live in their communities. As others have shown, community outreach and patient-or community-facing implementation strategies are needed, in addition to training clinicians for goals of care conversations.42 Future efforts to define care planning and appropriate outcomes will need to include representatives from diverse communities, interdisciplinary clinicians (e.g., nurses, social workers, chaplains, healthcare navigators) and other experts (e.g., community health workers, faith-based and community leaders, attorneys). ACP has evolved over the past several decades to a continuum of care planning focused on preparing people and their surrogate decision-makers for communication and medical decision-making, and it is still evolving. To get to the next level of ACP for clinical care and research, we must reconceptualize care planning as a holistic, ongoing process over the life course that includes both tailored in-the-moment and advanced decisions at every life stage. We suggest the need for a systems-level approach using evidenced-based methods of implementation science and human factors engineering and the inclusion of diverse communities and interdisciplinary experts to develop and evaluate processes to support the continuum of care planning in real-world settings.

AB  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires nearly perfect adherence to be effective. This study aims to identify key factors identified by HIV-infected adolescents on ART as contributing to medication adherence in western Kenya. Using a qualitative study design, three adolescent focus groups discussions were conducted at an urban and rural clinic site in western Kenya. The study population included HIV-infected adolescents receiving ART through the USAID-AMPATH HIV care system. A trained facilitator conducted groups in Kiswahili using a semistructured interview guide probing multiple aspects of experience of taking medicines. Transcribed focus group dialogs were analyzed using constant comparison, progressive coding, and triangulation. The adolescents described a context of negative societal beliefs about HIV, necessitating a lifestyle of secrecy and minimizing the information shared about HIV or ART. Assessing and addressing adolescents’ fears and behaviors regarding medication secrecy and disclosure may enable more accurate monitoring of adherence and development of intervention strategies.

AB  - To evaluate whether race influences agreement between screening results and documentation of cognitive impairment and delirium.Secondary data analysis.An urban, public hospital and healthcare system.Hospitalized older adults aged 65 and older admitted to general inpatient medical services evaluated for cognitive impairment (n = 851) and evaluated for delirium (n = 424).Cognitive impairment and delirium were measured in each participant using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), respectively, as the reference identification method. Clinical documentation of cognitive impairment and delirium was defined according to the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes from within 1 year before hospitalization through discharge for cognitive impairment or from hospital admission through discharge for delirium.Two hundred ninety-four participants (34%) had cognitive impairment based on SPMSQ performance, and 163 (38%) had delirium based on CAM results. One hundred seventy-one (20%) of those with cognitive impairment had an ICD-9 code for cognitive impairment, whereas 92 (22%) of those with delirium had an ICD-9 code for delirium. After considering age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, chronic comorbidity, and severity of acute illness, of those who screened positive on the SPMSQ, African Americans had a higher adjusted odds ratio (AOR) than non-African Americans for clinical documentation of cognitive impairment (AOR = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95-2.89), and of those who screened negative on the SPMSQ, African Americans had higher odds of clinical documentation of cognitive impairment (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.17-3.78) than non-African Americans. There were no differences in clinical documentation rates of delirium between African Americans and non-African Americans.Racial differences in coding for cognitive impairment may exist, resulting in higher documentation of cognitive impairment in African Americans screening positive or negative for cognitive impairment.

AB  - Newborn screening (NBS) has high-stakes health implications and requires rapid and effective communication between many people and organizations. Multiple NBS stakeholders worked together to create national guidance for reporting NBS results with HL7 (Health Level 7) messages that contain LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) and SNOMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms) codes, report quantitative test results, and use standardized computer-readable UCUM units of measure. This guidance (a LOINC panel and an example annotated HL7 message) enables standard HL7 v2.5.1 laboratory messages to carry the information required for reporting NBS results. Other efforts include HL7 implementation guides for reporting point-of-care (POC) NBS results as well as standardizing follow-up of patients diagnosed with conditions identified through NBS. If the guidance is used nationally, regional and national registries can aggregate results from state programs to facilitate research and quality assurance and help ensure continuity of operations following a disaster situation.

AB  - Widespread violence followed the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya resulting in the deaths of a reported 1,133 people and the displacement of approximately 660,000 others. At the time of the crisis the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (USAID-AMPATH) Partnership was operating 17 primary HIV clinics in western Kenya and treating 59,437 HIV positive patients (23,437 on antiretroviral therapy (ART)). This case study examines AMPATH’s provision of care and maintenance of patients on ART throughout the period of disruption. This was accomplished by implementing immediate interventions including rapid information dissemination through the media, emergency hotlines and community liaisons; organization of a Crisis Response leadership team; the prompt assembly of multidisciplinary teams to address patient care, including psychological support staff (in clinics and in camps for internally displaced persons (IDP)); and the use of the AMPATH Medical Records System to identify patients on ART who had missed clinic appointments. These interventions resulted in the opening of all AMPATH clinics within five days of their scheduled post-holiday opening dates, 23,949 patient visits in January 2008 (23,259 previously scheduled), uninterrupted availability of antiretrovirals at all clinics, treatment of 1,420 HIV patients in IDP camps, distribution of basic provisions, mobilization of outreach services to locate missing AMPATH patients and delivery of psychosocial support to 300 staff members and 632 patients in IDP camps. Key lessons learned in maintaining the delivery of HIV care in a crisis situation include the importance of advance planning to develop programs that can function during a crisis, an emphasis on a rapid programmatic response, the ability of clinics to function autonomously, patient knowledge of their disease, the use of community and patient networks, addressing staff needs and developing effective patient tracking systems.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinicians at our institution typically respond to about half of the prompts they are given by the clinic’s computer decision support system (CDSS). We sought to examine factors associated with clinician response to CDSS prompts as part of a larger, ongoing quality improvement effort to optimize CDSS use. Methods We examined patient, prompt, and clinician characteristics associated with clinician response to decision support prompts from the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. We asked pediatricians who were nonusers of CHICA to rate decision support topics as “easy” or “not easy” to discuss with patients and their guardians. We analyzed these ratings and data, from July 1, 2009 to January 29, 2013, utilizing a hierarchical regression model, to determine whether factors such as comfort with the prompt topic and the length of the user’s experience with CHICA contribute to user response rates. Results We examined 414 653 prompts from 22 260 patients. The length of time a clinician had been using CHICA was associated with an increase in their prompt response rate. Clinicians were more likely to respond to topics rated as “easy” to discuss. The position of the prompt on the page, clinician gender, and the patient’s age, race/ethnicity, and preferred language were also predictive of prompt response rate. Conclusion This study highlights several factors associated with clinician prompt response rates that could be generalized to other health information technology applications, including the clinician’s length of exposure to the CDSS, the prompt’s position on the page, and the clinician’s comfort with the prompt topic. Incorporating continuous quality improvement efforts when designing and implementing health information technology may ensure that its use is optimized.

AB  - Endoscopic ultrasound - guided celiac plexus block (EUS-CPB) is an established treatment for pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), but the effectiveness and safety of repeated procedures are unknown. Our objective is to report our experience of repeated EUS-CPB procedures within a single patient.A prospectively maintained EUS database was retrospectively analyzed to identify patients who had undergone more than one EUS-CPB procedure over a 17-year period. The main outcome measures included number of EUS-CPB procedures for each patient, self-reported pain relief, duration of pain relief, and procedure-related adverse events.A total of 248 patients underwent more than one EUS-CPB procedure and were included in our study. Patients with known or suspected CP (N = 248) underwent a mean (SD) of 3.1 (1.6) EUS-CPB procedures. In 76 % of the patients with CP, the median (range) duration of the response to the first EUS-CPB procedure was 10 (1 - 54) weeks. Lack of pain relief after the initial EUS-CPB was associated with failure of the next EUS-CPB (OR 0.17, 95 %CI 0.06 - 0.54). Older age at first EUS-CPB and pain relief after the first EUS-CPB were significantly associated with pain relief after subsequent blocks (P = 0.026 and P = 0.002, respectively). Adverse events included peri-procedural hypoxia (n = 2) and hypotension (n = 1) and post-procedural orthostasis (n = 2) and diarrhea (n = 4). No major adverse events occurred.Repeated EUS-CPB procedures in a single patient appear to be safe. Response to the first EUS-CPB is associated with response to subsequent blocks.

AB  - Because posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is both prevalent and underrecognized, routine primary care-based screening for PTSD has been implemented across the Veterans Health Administration. PTSD is frequently complicated by the presence of comorbid chronic pain, and patients with both conditions have increased symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Our objective was to determine whether the presence of pain affects diagnosis and treatment of PTSD among Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients who have a positive PTSD screening test. This retrospective cohort study used clinical and administrative data from six Midwestern VA medical centers. We identified 4,244 VA primary care patients with a positive PTSD screen and compared outcomes for those with and without a coexisting pain diagnosis. Outcomes were three clinically appropriate responses to positive PTSD screening: (1) mental health visit, (2) PTSD diagnosis, and (3) new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescription. We found that patients with coexisting pain had a lower rate of mental health visits than those without pain (hazard ratio: 0.889, 95% confidence interval: 0.821-0.962). There were no significant differences in the rate of PTSD diagnosis or new SSRI prescription between patients with and without coexisting pain.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Although patients want to participate in discussions and decisions about their end-of-life care, studies show that providers frequently fail to invite them to explore advanced care preferences or goals for living. The purpose of our demonstration project was to provide education and coaching to individuals, health providers, and organizations across the state of Indiana intended to facilitate these conversations, documenting and honoring individuals' life goals and preferences for care during the final stages of life. Method: Education and training engaged community members as well as healthcare providers to: (1) improve participant comfort and facility discussing end-of-life issues; (2) improve knowledge of healthcare choices, including palliative and hospice care; and (3) prepare all participants to explore and document personal values, life goals, and priorities as well as goals of care. Results: Between January of 2013 and June of 2015, the team educated close to 5,000 participants. Participants' ratings of the quality and perceived usefulness of the educational events ranged from 4 to 5 (using a 5-point scale, with 5 = most effective). Participant comments were overwhelmingly favorable and indicated an intention to put the advance care planning resources, communication skills, knowledge of palliative and hospice care, and personal renewal techniques into practice. Significance of Results: Participant motivation to foster advance care planning, discussions of palliative care, and end-of-life conversations was facilitated by the reframing of these conversations as identifying goals of care and priorities for living well during an important stage of life. Successful strategies included helping providers and patients to adopt a broader meaning for “sustaining hope” (not for cure, but for engaging in highly valued activities), developing provider communication skills and comfort in initiating potentially difficult discussions, engaging a new community health workforce who will develop trusting relationships with patients in home-based services, and fostering self-awareness and self-care among palliative care providers.

AB  - The symptom literature in cancer has primarily examined symptom severity, frequency and distress. Assessing cancer patients' perceptions of symptom importance—how important it is for them to see improvement in a symptom following an intervention—and factors influencing these judgments would also inform patient-centred care, but this analysis has not been undertaken. This qualitative study aimed to identify factors underlying perceptions of symptom importance among 25 symptomatic metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Participants were recruited from a cancer centre in the Midwestern USA. Semi-structured interviews focused on patients' rationale for considering common symptoms (i.e., anxiety, sadness, sleep problems, pain or fatigue) to be important. Thematic analyses revealed five interrelated factors underlying MBC patients' perceptions of symptom importance: activity restriction, concentration difficulties, exacerbation of other physical symptoms, symptom-related long-term health concerns and negative impact on their relationships with others. Patients most frequently stated that a physical or psychological symptom was important because of the resulting activity restriction. Additionally, some patients considered pain to be important because it signalled potential long-term health concerns, such as worsening metastatic disease. Findings suggest that clinicians should take into account MBC patients' perceptions of symptom importance and factors underlying these judgments when making shared treatment decisions.

AB  - Unprecedented amounts of data are produced by the health care and other sectors, presenting opportunities for local health departments (LHDs) to access these data. LHDs will need to participate in health information exchange (HIE) with a number of partners in order to benefit from these data resources. LHDs' participation in HIEs with specific partners has not been studied.To describe the level of and challenges in LHD participation in HIE with other partners, and variation by LHD population size and governance type.This research uses data from the 2015 Informatics Capacity and Needs Assessment Survey, with a target population of all LHDs in the United States. A representative sample of 650 LHDs was drawn using a stratified random sampling design. A total of 324 completed responses were received with a 50% response rate. Survey data were cleaned, and bivariate comparisons were conducted using χ and Somer's D.Substantial variation existed in LHDs' participation in HIE by type of exchange partner. Although 71% participated in HIE with the state departments of health, only 12% with jail/correctional health, 14% with health or county-based purchasing plans, and 15% with home health agencies. Compared with large LHDs (jurisdiction populations of ≥500 000), smaller LHDs were more likely to participate in HIE with state departments of health, but less likely with other exchange partners. The challenges to HIE participation were technological, and organizational/interorganizational in nature and variation existed by LHDs' population size and governance structure with respect to state authority.Local public health agencies more commonly participate in HIE with some partners, but may need to improve HIE with many others. National strategies targeting an increase in HIE of LHDs may use our findings to focus those initiatives.

AB  - Cognitive task analysis (CTA) can yield valuable insights into healthcare professionals' cognition and inform system design to promote safe, quality care. Our objective was to adapt CTA-the critical decision method, specifically-to investigate patient safety incidents, overcome barriers to implementing this method, and facilitate more widespread use of cognitive task analysis in healthcare.We adapted CTA to facilitate recruitment of healthcare professionals and developed a data collection tool to capture incidents as they occurred. We also leveraged the electronic health record (EHR) to expand data capture and used EHR-stimulated recall to aid reconstruction of safety incidents. We investigated 3 categories of medication-related incidents: adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and drug-disease interactions. Healthcare professionals submitted incidents, and a subset of incidents was selected for CTA. We analyzed several outcomes to characterize incident capture and completed CTA interviews.We captured 101 incidents. Eighty incidents (79%) met eligibility criteria. We completed 60 CTA interviews, 20 for each incident category. Capturing incidents before interviews allowed us to shorten the interview duration and reduced reliance on healthcare professionals' recall. Incorporating the EHR into CTA enriched data collection.The adapted CTA technique was successful in capturing specific categories of safety incidents. Our approach may be especially useful for investigating safety incidents that healthcare professionals "fix and forget." Our innovations to CTA are expected to expand the application of this method in healthcare and inform a wide range of studies on clinical decision making and patient safety.

AB  - Background Although intravenous (IV) smart pumps with built-in dose-error reduction systems (DERS) can reduce IV medication administration error, most serious adverse events still occur during IV medication administration. Sources of error include overriding DERS and manually bypassing drug libraries and the DERS. Methods Our purpose was to use the Regenstrief National Center for Medical Device Informatics data set to better understand IV smart pump drug library and DERS compliance. Our sample consisted of 12 months of data from 7 hospital systems, 44 individual hospitals, and descriptive data from the American Hospital Directory (AHD) for 2015. The aims of the study were (1) to determine whether there are differences in IV smart pump drug library compliance between hospital systems and (2) to provide a broad descriptive overview of relevant trends related to IV smart pump compliance. Results For aim 1, we found 3 significant relationships among the 7 hospital systems: systems 3 ( P &lt; 0.001), 6 ( P = 0.003), and 7 ( P = 0.002) had significantly higher IV smart compliance as compared with system 4. For aim 2, the number of drug library profiles was positively correlated ( P = 0.029) with IV smart pump compliance and the IV smart pump type used was significantly correlated ( P = 0.013) with IV smart pump compliance. Conclusions Our findings support that there are differences in IV smart pump compliance both within and between hospital systems and that IV smart pump type and the number of drug library profiles may be influencing factors. Further research is required to more accurately identify the impact of these factors in this very important area of patient safety.

AB  - Several opioid risk assessment tools are available to prescribers to evaluate opioid analgesic abuse among chronic patients. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify variables available in the literature to predict opioid abuse; 2) explore and compare methods (population, database, and analysis) used to develop statistical models that predict opioid abuse; and 3) understand how outcomes were defined in each statistical model predicting opioid abuse. The OVID database was searched for this study. The search was limited to articles written in English and published from January 1990 to April 2016. This search generated 1,409 articles. Only seven studies and nine models met our inclusion-exclusion criteria. We found nine models and identified 75 distinct variables. Three studies used administrative claims data, and four studies used electronic health record data. The majority, four out of seven articles (six out of nine models), were primarily dependent on the presence or absence of opioid abuse or dependence (ICD-9 diagnosis code) to define opioid abuse. However, two articles used a predefined list of opioid-related aberrant behaviors. We identified variables used to predict opioid abuse from electronic health records and administrative data. Medication variables are the recurrent variables in the articles reviewed (33 variables). Age and gender are the most consistent demographic variables in predicting opioid abuse. Overall, there is similarity in the sampling method and inclusion/exclusion criteria (age, number of prescriptions, follow-up period, and data analysis methods). Intuitive research to utilize unstructured data may increase opioid abuse models’ accuracy.

AB  - Little research has examined cancer patients' expectations, goals, and priorities for symptom improvement. Thus, we examined these outcomes in metastatic breast cancer patients to provide patients' perspectives on clinically meaningful symptom improvement and priorities for symptom management.Eighty women with metastatic breast cancer participated in a survey with measures of comorbidity, functional status, engagement in roles and activities, distress, quality of life, and the modified Patient-Centered Outcomes Questionnaire that focused on 10 common symptoms in cancer patients.On average, patients reported low to moderate severity across the 10 symptoms and expected symptom treatment to be successful. Patients indicated that a 49% reduction in fatigue, 48% reduction in thinking problems, and 43% reduction in sleep problems would represent successful symptom treatment. Cluster analysis based on ratings of the importance of symptom improvement yielded three clusters of patients: (1) those who rated thinking problems, sleep problems, and fatigue as highly important, (2) those who rated pain as moderately important, and (3) those who rated all symptoms as highly important. The first patient cluster differed from other subgroups in severity of thinking problems and education.Metastatic breast cancer patients report differing symptom treatment priorities and criteria for treatment success across symptoms. Considering cancer patients' perspectives on clinically meaningful symptom improvement and priorities for symptom management will ensure that treatment is consistent with their values and goals.

AB  - As the older adult population increases, it is imperative to increase older adults' opportunities for social involvement, thus maintaining their important roles and contributions to society. While there are known health-related benefits of volunteerism among older adults, a dearth of information exists on the perceived benefits of volunteerism among low-income and ethnic minority older adults.To understand the perceived psychosocial benefits of volunteering in the Senior Companion Program and to present findings of focus groups conducted with urban-dwelling, low-income older adult women volunteers.Inductive content analysis and the Dedoose qualitative data analysis software were used for analyzing data obtained from 59 older adult women Senior Companions who participated in nine focus groups.Content analyses of the focus group transcripts identified four major themes: (1) Reducing social isolation; (2) Improving quality of life; (3) Finding purpose and meaning; and (4) Increasing understanding of aging. The majority of our participants (81%) were African American women, with a mean age of 70 years. Approximately 83.1% had completed high school and 62.7% lived below the poverty line.Findings provided data rich in descriptions of positive psychosocial outcomes, finding meaning and purpose, and a better understanding of aging in urban-dwelling, low-income older women volunteers. The findings also provide support for the need for policies and programs that promote civic engagement in this population.

AB  - Falls among older adults are both a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, and a major source of morbidity and mortality. It is critical to identify fall patients quickly and reliably during, and immediately after, emergency department encounters in order to deliver appropriate care and referrals. Unfortunately, falls are difficult to identify without manual chart review, a time intensive process infeasible for many applications including surveillance and quality reporting. Here we describe a pragmatic NLP approach to automating fall identification. In this single center retrospective review, 500 emergency department provider notes from older adult patients (age 65 and older) were randomly selected for analysis. A simple, rules-based NLP algorithm for fall identification was developed and evaluated on a development set of 1084 notes, then compared with identification by consensus of trained abstractors blinded to NLP results. The NLP pipeline demonstrated a recall (sensitivity) of 95.8%, specificity of 97.4%, precision of 92.0%, and F1 score of 0.939 for identifying fall events within emergency physician visit notes, as compared to gold standard manual abstraction by human coders. Our pragmatic NLP algorithm was able to identify falls in ED notes with excellent precision and recall, comparable to that of more labor-intensive manual abstraction. This finding offers promise not just for improving research methods, but as a potential for identifying patients for targeted interventions, quality measure development and epidemiologic surveillance.

AB  - Introduction: The use of liquid biopsy on the blood from solid malignancies provides a convenient way of detecting actionable mutations, monitoring treatment response, detecting early recurrence and prognosticating outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss the current status and future direction of serum biomarkers in the clinical management of urinary bladder cancer.Areas covered: This review provides an overview of blood liquid biopsy and bladder cancer using methods of circulating tumors cells, circulating RNA, serum metabolites and cell-free DNA. Recent clinical studies and advances in methodology are emphasized. We performed a literature search using PMC/PubMed with keywords including ‘liquid biopsy’, ‘circulating tumor DNA’, ‘cell-free DNA’, ‘biomarkers’, ‘bladder cancer’ ‘precision medicine’. Additional articles were obtained from the cited references of key articles. An emphasis was placed on recent studies published since 2018.Expert opinion: Liquid biopsies represent a potential biomarker using cell-free DNA, metabolomic profiles of altered cellular metabolism, circulating cancer cells and RNA. Despite displaying tremendous clinical promise, the current status of the blood liquid biopsies has not reached fruition. However, future investigations should lead the evolution of liquid biomarker into clinical utility for the management of bladder cancer.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine the provider characteristics and job stressors that are related to turnover intention and actual turnover among community mental health providers. Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted with data collected from 186 community mental health providers from two agencies. Self-reported provider characteristics, job stressors, and turnover intention data were collected with the baseline survey, and actual turnover data were obtained from the agencies 12 months later. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with each turnover variable. Results: Turnover intention and actual turnover were correlated, yet a distinct set of variables was associated with each outcome. Namely, job stressors were related to turnover intention, while provider characteristics were related to actual turnover. Conclusions: Given that both turnover intention and actual turnover have important implications for both providers and agencies, it is critical to consider differential factors associated with each.

AB  - Universal early screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is recommended but not routinely performed.To determine whether computer-automated screening and clinical decision support can improve ASD screening rates in pediatric primary care practices.This cluster randomized clinical trial, conducted between November 16, 2010, and November 21, 2012, compared ASD screening rates among a random sample of 274 children aged 18 to 24 months in urban pediatric clinics of an inner-city county hospital system with or without an ASD screening module built into an existing decision support software system. Statistical analyses were conducted from February 6, 2017, to June 1, 2018.Four clinics were matched in pairs based on patient volume and race/ethnicity, then randomized within pairs. Decision support with the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation system (CHICA) was integrated with workflow and with the electronic health record in intervention clinics.The main outcome was screening rates among children aged 18 to 24 months. Because the intervention was discontinued among children aged 18 months at the request of the participating clinics, only results for those aged 24 months were collected and analyzed. Rates of positive screening results, clinicians' response rates to screening results in the computer system, and new cases of ASD identified were also measured. Main results were controlled for race/ethnicity and intracluster correlation.Two clinics were randomized to receive the intervention, and 2 served as controls. Records from 274 children (101 girls, 162 boys, and 11 missing information on sex; age range, 23-30 months) were reviewed (138 in the intervention clinics and 136 in the control clinics). Of 263 children, 242 (92.0%) were enrolled in Medicaid, 138 (52.5%) were African American, and 96 (36.5%) were Hispanic. Screening rates in the intervention clinics increased from 0% (95% CI, 0%-5.5%) at baseline to 68.4% (13 of 19) (95% CI, 43.4%-87.4%) in 6 months and to 100% (18 of 18) (95% CI, 81.5%-100%) in 24 months. Control clinics had no significant increase in screening rates (baseline, 7 of 64 children [10.9%]; 6-24 months after the intervention, 11 of 72 children [15.3%]; P = .46). Screening results were positive for 265 of 980 children (27.0%) screened by CHICA during the study period. Among the 265 patients with positive screening results, physicians indicated any response in CHICA in 151 (57.0%). Two children in the intervention group received a new diagnosis of ASD within the time frame of the study.The findings suggest that computer automation, when integrated with clinical workflow and the electronic health record, increases screening of children for ASD, but follow-up by physicians is still flawed. Automation of the subsequent workup is still needed.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01612897.

AB  - Background Effects of clinical practice changes on ICU delirium are not well understood. Objectives Determine ICU delirium rates over time. Methods Data from a previously described screening cohort of the Pharmacological Management of Delirium trial was analyzed. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) were assessed twice daily. We defined: Any delirium (positive CAM-ICU at any time during ICU stay) and ICU-acquired delirium (1st CAM-ICU negative with a subsequent positive CAM-ICU). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to test for differences. Results 2742 patient admissions were included. Delirium occurred in 16.5%, any delirium decreased [22.7% to 10.2% (p < 0.01)], and ICU-acquired delirium decreased [8.4% to 4.4% (p = 0.01)]. Coma decreased from 24% to 17.4% (p = 0.04). Later ICU years and higher mean RASS scores were associated with lower odds of delirium. Conclusions Delirium rates were not explained by the measured variables and further prospective research is needed.

AB  - We present a novel view of transitions from the lens of patient ergonomics (the "science of patient work"), which posits that patients and other non-professionals perform effortful work towards health-related goals. In patient work transitions, patients experience changes in, for example, health, task demands, work capacity, roles and responsibilities, knowledge and skills, routines, needs and technologies. Medication transitions are a particularly vulnerable type of patient work transitions. We describe two cases of medication transitions-new medications and medication deprescribing-in which the patient work lens reveals many accompanying changes, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for human factors and ergonomics.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the relationship between fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and healthcare utilization among long‐term breast cancer survivors (BCS). Methods In a cross‐sectional survey study, 505 younger survivors (YS: ≤45 years) and 622 older survivors (OS: 55–70 years) 3–8 years from diagnosis completed a questionnaire assessing demographics, medical history, FCR, and healthcare utilization. Healthcare utilization consisted of breast cancer (BC) and non‐BC‐related routine and nonroutine utilization. Results YS had significantly higher FCR than OS ( p &lt; 0.01). Independent of age, FCR was significantly associated with all three types of BC‐related utilization ( p &lt; 0.05). In the multivariate models, we found a significant, positive interaction effect between FCR and increased comorbidities on nonroutine BC appointments ( p = 0.01) and BC‐related emergency room visits ( p = 0.03). Additionally, comorbidities were associated with non‐BC‐related utilization ( p &lt; 0.01), and nonwhites were more likely to utilize nonroutine resources, both BC and non‐BC‐related ( p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Increased FCR has been associated with hypervigilance among survivors and may lead to increased healthcare utilization. YS are at higher risk for increased FCR and psychosocial concerns, which may lead to overutilization. Providers should be aware that higher FCR may be related to increased use of healthcare resources and that these patients might be better served with supportive resources to increase quality of life and decrease inappropriate utilization. While this study provides increased evidence of the relationship between FCR and healthcare utilization, interventions are needed for survivors at risk to address unmet needs, especially as life expectancy increases among BCS.

AB  - To test the impact of a multicomponent behavioral intervention to reduce the use of high-risk anticholinergic medications in primary care older adults.Cluster-randomized controlled trial.Ten primary care clinics within Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis.The multicomponent intervention included provider- and patient-focused components. The provider-focused component was computerized decision support alerting of the presence of a high-risk anticholinergic and offering dose- and indication-specific alternatives. The patient-focused component was a story-based video providing education and modeling an interaction with a healthcare provider resulting in a medication change. Alerts within the medical record triggered staff to play the video for a patient. Our design intended for parallel, independent priming of both providers and patients immediately before an outpatient face-to-face interaction.Medication orders were extracted from the electronic medical record system to evaluate the prescribing behavior and population prevalence of anticholinergic users. The intervention was introduced April 1, 2019, through March 31, 2020, and a preintervention observational period of April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019, facilitated difference in difference comparisons.A total of 552 older adults had visits at primary care sites during the study period, with mean age of 72.1 (SD 6.4) years and 45.3% African American. Of the 259 provider-focused alerts, only three (1.2%) led to a medication change. Of the 276 staff alerts, 4.7% were confirmed to activate the patient-focused intervention. The intervention resulted in no significant differences in either the number of discontinue orders for anticholinergics (intervention: two additional orders; control: five fewer orders, p = 0.7334) or proportion of the population using anticholinergics following the intervention (preintervention: 6.2% and postintervention: 5.1%, p = 0.6326).This multicomponent intervention did not reduce the use of high-risk anticholinergics in older adults receiving primary care. Improving nudges or a policy-focused component may be necessary to reduce use of high-risk medications.

AB  - Development of evidence-based practice requires practice-based evidence, which can be acquired through analysis of real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs). The EHR contains volumes of information about patients-physical measurements, diagnoses, exposures, and markers of health behavior-that can be used to create algorithms for risk stratification or to gain insight into associations between exposures, interventions, and outcomes. But to transform real-world data into reliable real-world evidence, one must not only choose the correct analytical methods but also have an understanding of the quality, detail, provenance, and organization of the underlying source data and address the differences in these characteristics across sites when conducting analyses that span institutions. This manuscript explores the idiosyncrasies inherent in the capture, formatting, and standardization of EHR data and discusses the clinical domain and informatics competencies required to transform the raw clinical, real-world data into high-quality, fit-for-purpose analytical data sets used to generate real-world evidence.

AB  - Health care organizations are increasingly documenting patients for social risk factors in structured data. Two main approaches to documentation, ICD-10 Z codes and screening questions, face limited adoption and conceptual challenges. This study compared estimates of social risk factors obtained via screening questions and ICD-10 Z diagnoses coding, as used in clinical practice, to estiamtes from validated survey instruments in a sample of adult primary care and emergency department patients at an urban safety-net health system. Financial strain, transportation barriers, food insecurity, and housing instability were independently assessed using instruments with published reliability and validity. These four social factors were also being collected by the health system in screening questions or could be mapped to ICD-10 Z code diagnosis code concepts. Neither the screening questions nor ICD-10 Z codes performed particularly well in terms of accuracy. For the screening questions, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores were 0.609 for financial strain, 0.703 for transportation, 0.698 for food insecurity, and 0.714 for housing instability. For the ICD-10 Z codes, AUC scores tended to be lower in the range of 0.523 to 0.535. For both screening questions and ICD-10 Z codes, the measures were much more specific than sensitive. Under real world conditions, ICD-10 Z codes and screening questions are at the minimal, or below, threshold for being diagnostically useful approaches to identifying patients' social risk factors. Data collection support through information technology or novel approaches combining data sources may be necessary to improve the usefulness of these data.

AB  - The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) has consistently advocated for a healthcare system that meets the needs of older adults, including addressing impacts of ageism in healthcare. The intersection of structural racism and ageism compounds the disadvantage experienced by historically marginalized communities. Structural racism and ageism have long been ingrained in all aspects of US society, including healthcare. This intersection exacerbates disparities in social determinants of health, including poor access to healthcare and poor outcomes. These deeply rooted societal injustices have been brought into the forefront of the collective public consciousness at different points throughout history. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare and exacerbated existing inequities inflicted on historically marginalized communities. Ageist rhetoric and policies during the COVID-19 pandemic further marginalized older adults. While the detrimental impact of structural racism on health has been well documented in the literature, generative research on the intersection of structural racism and ageism is limited. The AGS is working to identify and dismantle the healthcare structures that create and perpetuate these combined injustices and, in so doing, create a more just US healthcare system. This paper is intended to provide an overview of important frameworks and to guide future efforts to both identify and eliminate bias within healthcare delivery systems and health professions training with a particular focus on the intersection of structural racism and ageism.

AB  - Abstract Objective Most state Medicaid programs reimburse physicians for providing fluoride varnish, yet the only published studies of cost‐effectiveness do not show cost‐savings. Our objective is to apply state‐specific claims data to an existing published model to quickly and inexpensively estimate the cost‐savings of a policy consideration to better inform decisions – specifically, to assess whether I ndiana M edicaid children's restorative service rates met the threshold to generate cost‐savings. Methods Threshold analysis was based on the 2006 model by Q uiñonez et al . Simple calculations were used to “align” the Indiana Medicaid data with the published model. Q uarterly likelihoods that a child would receive treatment for caries were annualized. The probability of a tooth developing a cavitated lesion was multiplied by the probability of using restorative services. Finally, this rate of restorative services given cavitation was multiplied by 1.5 to generate the threshold to attain cost‐savings. Restorative services utilization rates, extrapolated from available I ndiana M edicaid claims, were compared with these thresholds. Results For children 1‐2 years old, restorative services utilization was 2.6 percent, which was below the 5.8 percent threshold for cost‐savings. However, for children 3‐5 years of age, restorative services utilization was 23.3 percent, exceeding the 14.5 percent threshold that suggests cost‐savings. Conclusions Combining a published model with state‐specific data, we were able to quickly and inexpensively demonstrate that restorative service utilization rates for children 36 months and older in Indiana are high enough that fluoride varnish regularly applied by physicians to children starting at 9 months of age could save Medicaid funds over a 3‐year horizon.

AB  - Plasma homocysteine, a metabolite involved in key cellular methylation processes seems to be implicated in cognitive functions and cardiovascular health with its high levels representing a potential modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. A better understanding of the genetic factors regulating homocysteine levels, particularly in non-white populations, may help in risk stratification analyses of existing clinical trials and may point to novel targets for homocysteine-lowering therapy. To identify genetic influences on plasma homocysteine levels in individuals with African ancestry, we performed a targeted gene and pathway-based analysis using a priori biological information and then to identify new association performed a genome-wide association study. All analyses used combined data from the African American and Yoruba cohorts from the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project. Targeted analyses demonstrated significant associations of homocysteine and variants within the CBS (Cystathionine beta-Synthase) gene. We identified a novel genome-wide significant association of the AD risk gene CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) with plasma homocysteine levels in both cohorts. Minor allele (T) carriers of identified CD2AP variant (rs6940729) exhibited decreased homocysteine level. Pathway enrichment analysis identified several interesting pathways including the GABA receptor activation pathway. This is noteworthy given the known antagonistic effect of homocysteine on GABA receptors. These findings identify several new targets warranting further investigation in relation to the role of homocysteine in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Summary Background: With the growing use of electronic health record systems, there is a demand for an electronic version of the leading American pediatric preventive care guideline, Bright Futures. As computer implementation requires actionable recommendations, it is important to assess to what degree Bright Futures meets criteria for actionability. Objectives: We aimed to 1) determine the number of actionable recommendations in the current edition of Bright Futures and 2) to recommend a specific format for representing an important class of guidelines in a way that better facilitates computer implementation. Methods: We consolidated all action statements in Bright Futures into recommendations. We then used two dimensions (decidability and executability) in the Guideline Implementability Appraisal v 2.0 (GLIA) to determine the actionability of the recommendations. Decidability means the recommendation states precisely under what conditions to perform those actions. Executability means actions are stated specifically, unambiguously and in sufficient detail. The results were presented in a figure titled Service Interval Diagram (SID), describing actionable recommendations, age intervals during which they are applicable, and how frequently they should occur in that interval. Results: We consolidated 2161 action items into 245 recommendations and identified 52 that were actionable (21%). Almost exclusively, these recommendations addressed screening, such as newborn metabolic screening, or child safety, such as car seat use. A limited number (n=13) of recommendations for other areas of anticipatory guidance were also actionable. No recommendations on child discipline, family function or mental health met our criteria for actionability. The SID representing these recommendations is presented in a figure. Conclusion: Only a portion of the Bright Futures Guidelines meets criteria for actionability. Substantial work lies ahead to develop most recommendations for anticipatory guidance into a computer implementable format. Citation: Finnell SME, Stanton JL1, Downs SM.

AB  - Delirium is highly prevalent among elderly post-operative patients with no pharmacological intervention approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention or treatment. We conducted a systematic evidence review to critically appraise literature related to the pharmacotherapy of post-operative delirium. Ten studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with two interventions for delirium treatment and eight interventions for delirium prevention in post-operative patients. The quality of evidence of delirium treatment studies was poor, whereas the quality of evidence in delirium prevention studies ranges from moderate to high. Delirium treatment studies find similar delirium duration and length-of-stay outcomes between haloperidol and either morphine or ondansetron. Risperidone was found to reduce the conversion of sub-syndromal delirium to delirium in one study compared to placebo. Haloperidol, olanzapine, and ketamine were each found to reduce delirium incidence, whereas rivastigmine had no impact on delirium incidence or duration. Lighter anesthesia as monitored by bi-spectral index led to a decreased delirium incidence. Considering results from studies conducted prior to the dates of this review, the current evidence suggests that certain pharmacologic classes and lighter sedation using BIS monitoring may prevent post-operative delirium, although a conclusive recommendation for clinical practice must await further research.

AB  - Shared decision-making (SDM) is imperative to person-centered care, yet little is known about what aspects of SDM are targeted during psychiatric visits. This secondary data analysis (191 psychiatric visits with 11 providers, coded with a validated SDM coding system) revealed two factors (scientific and preference-based discussions) underlying SDM communication. Preference-based discussion occurred less. Both provider and consumer initiation of SDM elements and decision complexity were associated with greater discussions in both factors, but were more strongly associated with scientific discussion. Longer visit length correlated with only scientific discussion. Providers’ understanding of core domains could facilitate engaging consumers in SDM.

AB  - Dentistry has historically seen tobacco dependence as a medical problem. As a consequence, dentistry has not adopted or developed effective interventions to deal with tobacco dependence. With the expanded use of electronic dental records, the authors identified an opportunity to incorporate standardized expert support for tobacco dependence counseling during the dental visit. Using qualitative results from observations and focus groups, a decision support system was designed that suggested discussion topics based on the patient's desire to quit and his or her level of nicotine addiction. Because dental providers are always pressed for time, the goal was a three-minute average intervention interval. To fulfill the provider's need for an easy way to track ongoing interventions, script usage was recorded. This process helped the provider track what he or she had said to the patient about tobacco dependence during previous encounters and to vary the messages. While the individual elements of the design process were not new, the combination of them proved to be very effective in designing a usable and accepted intervention. The heavy involvement of stakeholders in all components of the design gave providers and administrators ownership of the final product, which was ultimately adopted for use in all the clinics of a large dental group practice in Minnesota.

AB  - Abstract Objective We describe use cases and an institutional reference architecture for maintaining high-capacity, data-intensive network flows (e.g., 10, 40, 100 Gbps+) in a scientific, medical context while still adhering to security and privacy laws and regulations. Materials and Methods High-end networking, packet filter firewalls, network intrusion detection systems. Results We describe a “Medical Science DMZ” concept as an option for secure, high-volume transport of large, sensitive data sets between research institutions over national research networks. Discussion The exponentially increasing amounts of “omics” data, the rapid increase of high-quality imaging, and other rapidly growing clinical data sets have resulted in the rise of biomedical research “big data.” The storage, analysis, and network resources required to process these data and integrate them into patient diagnoses and treatments have grown to scales that strain the capabilities of academic health centers. Some data are not generated locally and cannot be sustained locally, and shared data repositories such as those provided by the National Library of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and international partners such as the European Bioinformatics Institute are rapidly growing. The ability to store and compute using these data must therefore be addressed by a combination of local, national, and industry resources that exchange large data sets. Maintaining data-intensive flows that comply with HIPAA and other regulations presents a new challenge for biomedical research. Recognizing this, we describe a strategy that marries performance and security by borrowing from and redefining the concept of a “Science DMZ”—a framework that is used in physical sciences and engineering research to manage high-capacity data flows. Conclusion By implementing a Medical Science DMZ architecture, biomedical researchers can leverage the scale provided by high-performance computer and cloud storage facilities and national high-speed research networks while preserving privacy and meeting regulatory requirements.

AB  - Objective: Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may experience continued impairment at home and school even after medication initiation. Group visits offer a way for pediatricians to provide more time to address ongoing needs. A pilot study was undertaken to examine whether a group visit model improved ADHD management in the pediatric medical home. Methods: Parents and children aged 6 to 18 years with ADHD were recruited and randomized to group visits or a usual care control. Data included attendance at ADHD follow-up visits, parent-rated ADHD symptoms, adaptive functioning, and quality of life. Longitudinal linear mixed models (continuous variables) and generalized linear mixed models (binary outcomes) were used to compare groups. In our statistical models, child and family were random effects; study assignment was a fixed effect. Results: Twenty families representing 29 children participated (intervention: 9 parents/13 children and control: 11 parents/16 children). Aside from race, baseline characteristics of participants were similar. None of the intervention families missed the expected 5 ADHD follow-up visits over 1 year; control families missed 1 or more visits over the same period. Intervention families reported an improved level of adaptive functioning at 12 months compared with control (mean severity score: 3.7 vs 4.4, p = .003). All families reported greater limitations and poorer quality of life compared with national norms. Conclusion: Group visits in the pediatric medical home can improve adherence, and preliminary results show a variety of improvements for the family.

AB  - In the intensive care unit (ICU), delirium is routinely measured with the widely-used, validated Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), but CAM-ICU has not been studied in patients with cirrhosis. We studied a group of patients with cirrhosis to determine the relationship between delirium measured by CAM-ICU and clinical outcomes. Consecutive patients with cirrhosis admitted to the ICU from 2009 to 2012 were included in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were screened twice daily for coma and delirium during their ICU stay using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and CAM-ICU. The association between delirium/coma and mortality was determined using multiple logistic regression. RASS and CAM-ICU were also compared to a retrospective assessment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Of 91 patients with cirrhosis, 26 (28.6 %) developed delirium/coma. RASS/CAM-ICU had fair agreement with the HE assessment (κ 0.38). Patients with delirium/coma had numerically greater mortality in-hospital (23.1 vs. 7.7 %, p = 0.07) and at 90 days (30.8 vs. 18.5 %, p = 0.26), and they also had longer hospital length of stay (median 19.5 vs. 6 days, p < 0.001). Delirium/coma was associated with increased inpatient mortality, independent of disease severity (unadjusted OR 3.6; 95 % CI, 0.99-13.1; MELD-adjusted OR 5.4; 95 % CI, 1.3-23.8; acute physiology score-adjusted OR 2.2; 95 % CI, 0.53-8.9). Delirium/coma was also associated with longer length of stay after adjusting for disease severity. In critically ill patients with cirrhosis, delirium/coma as measured by the RASS and CAM-ICU is associated with increased mortality and hospital length of stay. For these patients, these measures provide valuable information and may be useful tools for clinical care. RASS and CAM-ICU need to be compared to HE-specific measures in future studies.

AB  - Purpose: Pediatric providers are increasingly screening for postpartum depression (PD), yet it unknown how often mothers comply with recommendations to seek treatment. The objectives were to describe the rate at which mothers with suspected PD seek treatment and explore factors that predict help-seeking behavior. Design and Methods: Mothers were recruited from 4 pediatric clinics after identification using the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. Mothers with a positive screen were invited to participate in a telephone interview between January 2012 and December 2014. Mothers reported if they sought treatment or called a community resource. Results: 73 of 133 eligible mothers participated (55% response rate). Fifty women recalled a recommendation to seek help. Only 43.8% (32/73) made a follow up appointment with an adult provider and even fewer kept the appointment. Conclusions: A majority of mothers suspected of having PD recalled a referral for further intervention; yet, less than half took action. Further investigation of barriers of help-seeking behavior is warranted.

AB  - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) finalized a comprehensive update to nursing home requirements of participation in October 2016. Nearly 10,000 public comments were received regarding the proposed rule, and CMS made multiple modifications based on comments from providers, advocacy organizations, and others before issuing the final rule. The final rule describing nursing home requirements of participation modernizes nursing home regulation. It is being implemented in three phases—beginning in November 2016, November 2017, and November 2019. There are multiple provisions that have implications for clinicians caring for nursing home residents, particularly in terms of management of infections, medication prescribing and monitoring, and delegation of medical orders.

AB  - Chronic pain is an important comorbidity among individuals with HIV. Behavioral interventions are widely regarded as evidence-based, efficacious non-pharmacologic interventions for chronic pain in the general population. An accepted principle in behavioral science is that theory-based, systematically-developed behavioral interventions tailored to the unique needs of a target population are most likely to be efficacious. Our aim was to use Intervention Mapping to systematically develop a Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based intervention for chronic pain tailored to individuals with HIV that will improve pain intensity and pain-related functional impairment. Our Intervention Mapping process was informed by qualitative inquiry of 24 patients and seven providers in an HIV primary care clinic. The resulting intervention includes group and one-on-one sessions and peer and staff interventionists. We also developed a conceptual framework that integrates our qualitative findings with SCT-based theoretical constructs. Using this conceptual framework as a guide, our future work will investigate the intervention's impact on chronic pain outcomes, as well as our hypothesized proximal mediators of the intervention's effect.

AB  - Objectives To assess the use of the Indiana Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST) form to record nursing home (NH) resident treatment preferences and associated practices. Design Survey. Setting Indiana NHs. Participants Staff responsible for advance care planning in 535 NHs. Measurements Survey about use of the Indiana POST, related policies, and educational activities. Methods NHs were contacted by telephone or email. Nonresponders were sent a brief postcard survey. Results Ninety‐one percent (n=486) of Indiana NHs participated, and 79% had experience with POST. Of the 65% of NHs that complete POST with residents, 46% reported that half or more residents had a POST form. POST was most often completed at the time of admission (68%). Only 52% of participants were aware of an existing facility policy regarding use of POST; 80% reported general staff education on POST. In the 172 NHs not using POST, reasons for not using it included unfamiliarity with the tool (23%) and lack of facility policies (21%). Conclusion Almost 3 years after a grassroots campaign to introduce the voluntary Indiana POST program, a majority of NHs were using POST to support resident care. Areas for improvement include creating policies on POST for all NHs, training staff on POST conversations, and considering processes that may enhance the POST conversation, such as finding an optimal time to engage in conversations about treatment preferences other than a potentially rushed admission process.

AB  - Background: Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based practice that helps persons with mental and/or physical disabilities, including spinal cord injury, find meaningful employment in the community. While employment is associated with positive rehabilitation outcomes, more research is needed on the impact of IPS participation on non-vocational outcomes, particularly quality of life (QOL). Objective: To identity QOL outcomes experienced with (1) IPS participation and (2) IPS participation leading to employment. Methods: Using a mixed method design, data on quality of life outcomes were collected from 151 interviews and 213 surveys completed by veterans with SCI participating in IPS. Results: At 12 months, participants who obtained competitive employment (CE) and those who did not (no-CE) showed improvement on most measures. In months 12-24, the CE group showed improvements on all study measures while the no-CE group declined on many indices. Statistically significant changes were observed between participants who obtained CE versus no-CE on several measures. Themes were identified from interview data related to productivity and well-being. Productivity themes were (1) contributing to society, (2) earning an income, and (3) maintaining employment. Themes for well-being were (1) mental health/self-confidence, (2) physical health, and (3) goal setting. Themes were associated with IPS participation irrespective of employment outcomes. Conclusion: IPS participants who were competitively employed report consistent improvement in handicap, health-related QOL, and life satisfaction measures across time. Qualitative findings revealed improved QOL outcomes in productivity and well-being for veterans participating in IPS overall, regardless of employment outcomes.

AB  - Communication breakdowns in the referral process negatively impact clinical workflow and patient safety. There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the impact of published design recommendations addressing contributing issues with consultation order templates. This study translated the recommendations into a computer-based prototype and conducted a comparative usability evaluation. With a scenario-based simulation, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a within-group, counterbalanced experiment comparing the prototype with their present electronic order entry system. The prototype significantly increased satisfaction (Cohen's d = 1.80, 95% CI [1.19, 2.41], p < .001), and required significantly less mental effort (d = 0.67 [0.14, 1.20], p < .001). Regarding efficiency, the prototype required significantly fewer mouse clicks (mean difference = 29 clicks, p < .001). Although overall task time did not differ significantly (d = −0.05 [−0.56, 0.47]), the prototype significantly quickened identification of the appropriate specialty clinic (mean difference = 12 s, d = 0.98 [0.43, 1.52], p < .001). The experimental evidence demonstrated that clinician-centered interfaces significantly improved system usability during ordering of consultations.

AB  - Objective: We examined patient and caregiver experiences of health services for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Indiana. The objective was to provide an understanding of their lived experiences and to inform policies and practices for health services delivery for TBI.Methods: We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 62 participants (34 patients and 28 caregivers). Data analysis was guided by constructive grounded theory.Results: Three interrelated themes emerged from the data and characterised participants’ experiences accessing health services for TBI: 1) inadequate access to health services; 2) unavailability of specialised, age-appropriate, and long-term health services; and 3) transportation barriers to health services that limit access to care and amplify rural health disparities for patients.Conclusion: Our findings identified significant barriers to health services for patients with TBI at different points in the care continuum. Gaps in health services and barriers to care transcend geographical boundaries within the state. We suggest ways to improve access to TBI care including: 1) decentralisation of trauma centers; 2) development of neurobehavioural and age-appropriate long-term care facilities; 3) increased workforce with expertise in TBI treatment; and 4) improved access to transportation services for patients with a TBI.

AB  - Sleep disturbance may limit improvement in pain outcomes if not directly addressed in treatment. Moreover, sleep problems may be exacerbated by opioid therapy. This study examined the effects of baseline sleep disturbance on improvement in pain outcomes using data from the Strategies for Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness (SPACE) trial, a pragmatic 12-month randomized trial of opioid vs nonopioid medication therapy.Participants with chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain were randomized to either opioid therapy (N = 120) or nonopioid medication therapy (N = 120).We used mixed models for repeated measures to 1) test whether baseline sleep disturbance scores modified the effect of opioid vs nonopioid treatment on pain outcomes and 2) test baseline sleep disturbance scores as a predictor of less improvement in pain outcomes across both treatment groups.The tests for interaction of sleep disturbance by treatment group were not significant. Higher sleep disturbance scores at baseline predicted less improvement in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference (β = 0.058, P = 0.0002) and BPI severity (β = 0.026, P = 0.0164).Baseline sleep disturbance adversely affects pain response to treatment regardless of analgesic regimen. Recognition and treatment of sleep impairments that frequently co-occur with pain may optimize outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background For complex patients with chronic conditions, electronic health records (EHRs) contain large amounts of relevant historical patient data. To use this information effectively, clinicians may benefit from visual information displays that organize and help them make sense of information on past and current treatments, outcomes, and new treatment options. Unfortunately, few clinical decision support tools are designed to support clinical sensemaking. Objective The objective of this study was to describe a decision-centered design process, and resultant interactive patient information displays, to support key clinical decision requirements in chronic noncancer pain care. Methods To identify key clinical decision requirements, we conducted critical decision method interviews with 10 adult primary care clinicians. Next, to identify key information needs and decision support design seeds, we conducted a half-day multidisciplinary design workshop. Finally, we designed an interactive prototype to support the key clinical decision requirements and information needs uncovered during the previous research activities. Results The resulting Chronic Pain Treatment Tracker prototype summarizes the current treatment plan, past treatment history, potential future treatments, and treatment options to be cautious about. Clinicians can access additional details about each treatment, current or past, through modal views. Additional decision support for potential future treatments and treatments to be cautious about is also provided through modal views. Conclusion This study designed the Chronic Pain Treatment Tracker, a novel approach to decision support that presents clinicians with the information they need in a structure that promotes quick uptake, understanding, and action.

AB  - Despite efforts aimed at improving the integration of clinical data from health information exchanges (HIE) and electronic health records (EHR), interoperability remains limited. Barriers due to inefficiencies and workflow interruptions make using HIE data during care delivery difficult. Capitalizing on the development of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) specification, we designed and developed a Chest Pain Dashboard that integrates HIE data into EHRs. This Dashboard was implemented in one emergency department (ED) of Indiana University Health in Indiana. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a mixed-methods evaluation of the Dashboard. A difference-in-difference analysis suggests that the ED with the Dashboard implementation resulted in a significant increase in HIE use compared to EDs without. This finding was supported by qualitative interviews. While these results are encouraging, we also identified areas for improvement. FHIR-based solutions may offer promising approaches to encourage greater accessibility and use of HIE data.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and pain intensity among veterans with musculoskeletal disorder diagnoses (MSDs; nontraumatic joint disorder; osteoarthritis; low back, back, and neck pain). Setting Administrative and electronic health record data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Subjects A national cohort of US military veterans with MSDs in VHA care during 2001–2012 (N = 1,759,338). Methods These cross-sectional data were analyzed using hurdle negative binomial models of pain intensity as a function of BMI, adjusted for comorbidities and demographics. Results The sample had a mean age of 59.4, 95% were male, 77% were white/Non-Hispanic, 79% were overweight or obese, and 42% reported no pain at index MSD diagnosis. Overall, there was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and pain (nadir = 27 kg/m2), with the severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) being most likely to report any pain (OR vs normal weight = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.21–1.26). The association between BMI and pain varied by MSD, with a stronger relationship in the osteoarthritis group and a less pronounced relationship in the back and low back pain groups. Conclusions There was a high prevalence of overweight/obesity among veterans with MSD. High levels of BMI (&amp;gt;27 kg/m2) were associated with increased odds of pain, most markedly among veterans with osteoarthritis.

AB  - Abstract Background Despite proven effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, at least 35% of screen-eligible adults are not current with screening. Decision aids and risk prediction tools may help increase uptake, adherence, and efficiency of CRC screening by presenting lower-risk patients with options less invasive than colonoscopy. The purpose of this qualitative study was to determine patient and provider perceptions of facilitators and barriers to use of a risk prediction tool for advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRC and advanced, precancerous polyps), to maximize its chances of successful clinical implementation. Methods We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with patients aged 50–75 years who were not current with CRC screening, and primary care providers (PCPs) at an academic and a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Midwest from October 2016 through March 2017. Participants were asked about their current experiences discussing CRC screening, then were shown the risk tool and asked about its acceptability, barriers, facilitators, and whether they would use it to guide their choice of a screening test. The constant comparative method guided analysis. Results Thirty patients and PCPs participated. Among facilitators were the tool’s potential to increase screening uptake, reduce patient risk, improve resource allocation, and facilitate discussion about CRC screening. PCP-identified barriers included concerns about the tool’s accuracy, consistency with guidelines, and time constraints. Conclusions Patients and PCPs found the risk prediction tool useful, with potential to increase uptake, safety, and efficiency of CRC screening, indicating potential acceptability and feasibility of implementation into clinical practice.

AB  - Background Aberrant angiogenesis may play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Objective To explore the relationship between angiogenesis activity and evidence of neurodegeneration among older adults. Methods Cross-sectional study of 49 older adults clinically characterized as cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or early Alzheimer's disease. In addition to neuroimaging, we completed assays on peripheral blood, including: vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, fibroblast growth factor, and amyloid-β peptide 40. We used advanced polychromatic flow cytometry to phenotype circulating mononuclear cells to assess angiogenesis activity. Results Although we documented differences in cognitive performance, structural changes on neuroimaging, and burden of amyloid and tau on positron emission tomography, angiogenesis activity did not vary by group. Interestingly, VEGF levels were shown to be increased among subjects with mild cognitive impairment. In ANCOVA models controlling for age, sex, intracranial volume, and monocyte subpopulations, angiogenesis activity was correlated with increased white matter hyperintensities. Conclusion We demonstrate a significant association between angiogenesis activity and cerebrovascular disease. To better understand the potential of angiogenesis as an intervention target, longitudinal studies are needed.

AB  - Abstract Large observational data networks that leverage routine clinical practice data in electronic health records (EHRs) are critical resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data normalization is a key challenge for the secondary use of EHRs for COVID-19 research across institutions. In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19.

AB  - Many breast cancer survivors (BCSs) recover from the negative sequelae of cancer treatment. However, some report persistent and disruptive distress well into disease-free survivorship. More information is needed on the predictors of distress in this growing population of BCS, including the role of avoidant coping, or attempts to avoid thoughts, feelings, and reminders of cancer, in mediating the relationship between distress and psychological, physical, and social domains of well-being.In a large cross-sectional study, BCS (n = 1,127), who were 3 to 8 years post-diagnosis, completed a survey assessing demographic characteristics, medical history, distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms), avoidant coping, and physical (fatigue), psychological (fear of recurrence, attention, body image), and social (social support from a partner, social constraints from a partner) well-being. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to determine if avoidant coping mediated the relationship between each distress variable (anxiety and depressive symptoms) and each well-being (fear of recurrence, attention, body image, fatigue, social support, and social constraints) variable.In all six mediation models, avoidant coping significantly (p < 0.001) mediated the relationship between each well-being variable (fear of recurrence, attention, body image, fatigue, social support, and social constraints) and each distress indicator (depression and anxiety). Avoidant coping mediated 19%-54% of the effects of the contributing factors on the distress variables.Avoidant coping may indicate risk for, or presence of, distress among BCS. Interventions to reduce distress may benefit from addressing avoidant coping styles.

AB  - While many landmark solid tumor immunotherapy studies show clinical benefits for solid tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), the methodologies focus only on confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for MSI-H. Because some tumors are either dMMR or MSI-H but not the other, clinicians must choose between two testing methods for a broad patient population. We investigated the level of correlation between MMR protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) and microsatellite PCR testing results in 62 cancer patients. Thirty-five of the 62 cases (56.5%) were MSI-H by PCR, whereas 35 (56.5%) were dMMR by IHC. MMR IHC results correlated well with MSI PCR in 32 co-positive cases (91.4%) and 24 co-negative cases (88.9%). Six discrepant cases (9.7%) were identified, among which three were MSI-H and MMR intact, and three were dMMR and microsatellite stable. The results of this study highlight the implications of dMMR/MSI testing strategies on precision oncology. Co-testing with both MMR IHC and MSI PCR may be an effective screening strategy for evaluating immunotherapy eligibility status for solid tumors.

AB  - Abstract Most innovations developed to reduce the burden of Alzheimer disease and other related dementias (ADRD) are difficult to implement, diffuse, and scale. The consequences of such challenges in design, implementation, and diffusion are suboptimal care and resulting harm for people living with ADRD and their caregivers. National experts identified four factors that contribute to our limited ability to implement and diffuse of evidence‐based services and interventions for people living with ADRD: (1) limited market demand for the implementation and diffusion of effective ADRD interventions; (2) insufficient engagement of persons living with ADRD and those caring for them in the development of potential ADRD services and interventions; (3) limited evidence and experience regarding scalability and sustainability of evidence‐based ADRD care services; and (4) difficulties in taking innovations that work in one context and successfully implementing them in other contexts. New investments in the science of human‐centered design, implementation, and diffusion are crucial for meeting the goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease under the auspices of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.

AB  - Background Early studies on COVID-19 identified unequal patterns in hospitalization and mortality in urban environments for racial and ethnic minorities. These studies were primarily single center observational studies conducted within the first few weeks or months of the pandemic. We sought to examine trends in COVID-19 morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality over time for minority and rural populations, especially during the U.S. fall surge. Methods Data were extracted from a statewide cohort of all adult residents in Indiana tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2020, linked to electronic health records. Primary measures were per capita rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Age adjusted rates were calculated for multiple time periods corresponding to public health mitigation efforts. Comparisons across time within groups were compared using ANOVA. Results Morbidity and mortality increased over time with notable differences among sub-populations. Initially, hospitalization rates among racial minorities were 3–4 times higher than whites, and mortality rates among urban residents were twice those of rural residents. By fall 2020, hospitalization and mortality rates in rural areas surpassed those of urban areas, and gaps between black/brown and white populations narrowed. Changes across time among demographic groups was significant for morbidity and hospitalization. Cumulative morbidity and mortality were highest among minority groups and in rural communities. Conclusions The synchronicity of disparities in COVID-19 by race and geography suggests that health officials should explicitly measure disparities and adjust mitigation as well as vaccination strategies to protect those sub-populations with greater disease burden.

AB  - Chronic cough (CC) affects approximately 10% of adults. Many disease states are associated with chronic cough, such as asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The lack of an ICD code specific for chronic cough makes it challenging to identify such patients from electronic health records (EHRs). For clinical and research purposes, computational methods using EHR data are urgently needed to identify chronic cough cases. This research aims to investigate the data representations and deep learning algorithms for chronic cough prediction. Utilizing real-world EHR data from a large academic healthcare system from October 2005 to September 2015, we investigated Natural Language Representation of the EHR data and systematically evaluated deep learning and traditional machine learning models to predict chronic cough patients. We built these machine learning models using structured data (medication and diagnosis) and unstructured data (clinical notes). The sensitivity and specificity of a transformer-based deep learning algorithm, specifically BERT with attention model, was 0.856 and 0.866, respectively, using structured data (medication and diagnosis). Sensitivity and specificity improved to 0.952 and 0.930 when we combined structured data with symptoms extracted from clinical notes. We further found that the attention mechanism of deep learning models can be used to extract important features that drive the prediction decisions. Compared with our previously published rule-based algorithm, the deep learning algorithm can identify more chronic cough patients with structured data. By applying deep learning models, chronic cough patients can be reliably identified for prospective or retrospective research through medication and diagnosis data, widely available in EHR and electronic claims data, thus improving the generalizability of the patient identification algorithm. Deep learning models can identify chronic cough patients with even higher sensitivity and specificity when structured and unstructured EHR data are utilized. We anticipate language-based data representation and deep learning models developed in this research could also be productively used for other disease prediction and case identification.

AB  - Racial disparities, including decreased hospice utilization, lower quality symptom management, and poor-quality end-of-life care have been well documented in Black Americans. Improving health equity and access to high-quality serious illness care is a national palliative care (PC) priority. Accomplishing these goals requires clinician reflection, engagement, and large-scale change in clinical practice and health-related policies. In this article, we provide an overview of key concepts that underpin racism in health care, discuss common serious illness disparities in Black Americans, and propose steps to promote the delivery of antiracist PC.

AB  - Background and Aims The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care for more than 80,000 veterans with cirrhosis. This longitudinal, multimethod evaluation of a cirrhosis care quality improvement program aimed to (1) identify implementation strategies associated with evidence-based, guideline-concordant cirrhosis care over time, and (2) use qualitative interviews to operationalize strategies for a manualized intervention. Approach and Results VHA providers were surveyed annually about the use of 73 implementation strategies to improve cirrhosis care in fiscal years 2018 (FY18) and 2019 (FY19). Implementation strategies linked to guideline-concordant cirrhosis care were identified using bivariate statistics and comparative configurational methods. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 facilities in the highest quartile of cirrhosis care to specify the successful implementation strategies and their mechanisms of change. A total of 106 VHA facilities (82%) responded at least once over the 2-year period (FY18, n = 63; FY19, n = 100). Facilities reported using a median of 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 20) implementation strategies in FY18 and 10 (IQR 19) in FY19. Of the 73 strategies, 35 (48%) were positively correlated with provision of evidence-based cirrhosis care. Configurational analysis identified multiple strategy pathways directly linked to more guideline-concordant cirrhosis care. Across both methods, a subset of eight strategies was determined to be core to cirrhosis care improvement and specified using qualitative interviews. Conclusions In a national cirrhosis care improvement initiative, a multimethod approach identified a core subset of successful implementation strategy combinations. This process of empirically identifying and specifying implementation strategies may be applicable to other implementation challenges in hepatology.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the utilization of telehealth for headache services within the Veterans Health Administration's facilities housing a Headache Centers of Excellence and multiple stakeholder's perspectives to inform future telehealth delivery.Telehealth delivery of headache treatment may enhance patient access to headache care, yet little is known about the utilization or patient and provider perceptions of telehealth for veterans with headache.This mixed-methods study analyzed multiple data sources: (1) administrative data, which included 58,798 patients with medically diagnosed headache disorders, documented in at least one outpatient visit, from August 2019 through September 2020 from the 12 Veterans Health Administration's facilities with a Headache Center of Excellence and (2) qualitative semistructured interviews with 20 patients and 43 providers 6 months before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and 10 patients and 20 providers 6 months during the beginning of the pandemic.During the pandemic, in-person visits declined from 12,794 to 6099 (52.0%), whereas video (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.66, 2.52), and telephone visits (IRR = 15.2, 95% CI = 10.7, 21.6) significantly increased. Utilization differed based on patient age, race/ethnicity, and rurality. Patients and providers perceived value in using telehealth, yet had limited experience with this modality pre-pandemic. Providers preferred in-person appointments for initial encounters and telehealth for follow-up visits. Providers and patients identified benefits and challenges of telehealth delivery, often relying on multiple delivery methods for telehealth to enhance patient engagement.The uptake of telehealth delivery of headache-related care rapidly expanded in response to the pandemic. Patients and providers were amenable to utilizing telehealth, yet also experienced technological barriers. To encourage equitable access to telehealth and direct resources to those in need, it is crucial to understand patient preferences regarding in-person versus telehealth visits and identify patient groups who face barriers to access.

From 2005 to 2008, 533 patients aged ≥65 years and without a diagnosis of CI were recruited; 423 were retested 24 months after baseline.CR physicians were significantly more likely to order cognitive-related interventions (P = .02), document discussions about cognition (P = .003), and order blood tests to rule out reversible CI (P = .002). At follow-up, significantly more CR patients had a medication for cognition listed in their chart (P = .02). There was no difference in the rate of cognitive decline between the groups.Providing cognitive information to physicians resulted in higher rates of physician-initiated interventions for patients with CI.

AB  - Although neighborhood characteristics have important relationships with health outcomes, direct observation involves imperfect measurement. The African American Health (AAH) study included two observer neighborhood rating systems (5-item Krause and 18-item AAH Neighborhood Assessment Scale [NAS]), initially fielded at two different waves. Good measurement characteristics were previously shown for both, but there was more rater variability than desired. In 2010 both measures were re-fielded together, with enhanced training and field methods implemented to decrease rater variability while maintaining psychometric properties. AAH included a poor inner city and more heterogeneous suburban areas. Four interviewers rated 483 blocks, with 120 randomly-selected blocks rated by two interviewers. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis of scales and tested the Krause (5-20 points), AAH 18-item NAS (0-28 points), and a previous 7-item and new 5-item versions of the NAS (0-17 points, 0-11 points). Retest reliability for items (kappa) and scales (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]) were calculated overall and among pre-specified subgroups. Linear regression assessed interviewer effects on total scale scores and assessed concurrent validity on lung and lower body functions. Mismeasurement effects on self-rated health were also assessed. Scale scores were better in the suburbs than in the inner city. ICC was poor for the Krause scale (ICC=0.19), but improved if the retests occurred within 10 days (ICC=0.49). The 7- and 5-item NAS scales had better ICCs (0.56 and 0.62, respectively), and were higher (0.71 and 0.73) within 10 days. Rater variability for the Kraus and 5- and 7-item NAS scales was 1-3 points (compared to the supervising rater). Concurrent validity was modest, with residents living in worse neighborhood conditions having worse function. Unadjusted estimates were biased towards the null compared with measurement-error corrected estimates. Enhanced field protocols and rater training did not improve measurement quality. Specifically, retest reliability and interviewer variability remained problematic. Measurement error partially reduced, but did not eliminate concurrent validity, suggesting there are robust associations between neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. We conclude that the 5-item AAH NAS has sufficient reliability and validity for further use. Additional research on the measurement properties of environmental rating methods is encouraged.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: Considering the discussion on implementing routine dementia screening in Germany, the objective of the current study was to validate the German version of the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) questionnaire and to determine the acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screening in elderly German adults. Methods: The German version of the PRISM-PC was administered to a subsample of participants who attended the Berlin Aging Study II ( n = 506). The questionnaire was validated by exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Regarding acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screening (Section B) a single factor structure fitted best. In terms of attitudes regarding Alzheimer's disease (Section D), a hierarchical factor structure was modeled with the higher-order factor “Harms” covering the domains “Family Burden,” “Dependence,” “Emotional Suffering,” “Stigma,” and “Medical Care” on the one hand and the domain “Future Planning” on the other hand. Internal consistency of the different scales reached from α = 0.67 to α = 0.94. Overall, 71.2% of the participants indicated that they wanted to be screened for Alzheimer's disease on a regular basis. Conclusions: This study suggests that acceptance can reliably be assessed with the section “Acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screenings” of the German PRISM-PC questionnaire. Furthermore, the majority of elderly German adults would like to be screened for Alzheimer's disease regularly, which might be an effective starting point in order to implement routine dementia screenings. As the sample is a convenience sample of (relatively) healthy older adults, generalizability of these results is limited.

AB  - In 2011, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) released the Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Directive, which mandated reorganization of acute stroke care, including self-designation of stroke centers as Primary (P), Limited Hours (LH), or Supporting (S).In partnership with the VHA Offices of Emergency Medicine and Specialty Care Services, the VA Stroke QUERI conducted a formative evaluation in a national sample of three levels of stroke centers in order to understand barriers and facilitators.The evaluation consisted of a mixed-methods assessment that included a qualitative assessment of data from semi-structured interviews with key informants and a quantitative assessment of stroke quality-of-care data reporting practices by facility characteristics.The final sample included 38 facilities (84 % participation rate): nine P, 24 LH, and five S facilities. In total, we interviewed 107 clinicians and 16 regional Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) leaders.Across all three levels of stroke centers, stroke teams identified the specific need for systematic nurse training to triage and initiate stroke protocols. The most frequently reported barriers centered around quality-of-care data collection. A low number of eligible veterans arriving at the VAMC in a timely manner was another major impediment. The LH and S facilities reported some unique barriers: access to radiology and neurology services; EMS diverting stroke patients to nearby stroke centers, maintaining staff competency, and a lack of stroke clinical champions. Solutions that were applied included developing stroke order sets and templates to provide systematic decision support, implementing a stroke code in the facility for a coordinated response to stroke, and staff resource allocation and training. Data reporting by facility evaluation demonstrated that categorizing site volume did indicate a lower likelihood of reporting among VAMCs with 25-49 acute stroke admissions per year.The AIS Directive brought focused attention to reorganizing stroke care across a wide range of facility types. Larger VA facilities tended to follow established practices for organizing stroke care, but the unique addition of the LH designation presented some challenges. S facilities tended to report a lack of a coordinated stroke team and champion to drive process changes.

AB  - Rapid brain imaging for ischemic stroke is important for patient outcomes. We sought to determine the proportion of ischemic stroke patients receiving brain imaging within the guideline-recommended 24 hours, and predictors of faster imaging among patients with acute symptoms.Retrospective analysis of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Performance Measurement Stroke Special Project data. Of 3000 ischemic stroke patients, secondary samples included 649 presenting within 6 hours of onset, and 217 potentially tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-eligible patients (onset-to-arrival time <3 hours, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >2). Two linear regression models examined the association between door-to-imaging time and predictors among secondary samples, accounting for clustering within hospital.Of the 3000 ischemic stroke patients, 97.1% had brain imaging within 24 hours. Among patients presenting within 6 hours of onset, median door-to-imaging time was 59 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 33-109). Predictors of faster door-to-imaging time included elevated arrival blood pressure and stroke center presentation. Among the potentially tPA-eligible patients, median door-to-imaging time was 52 minutes (IQR, 31-105); no significant predictors were identified.Nearly all ischemic stroke patients at VHA hospitals have door-to-imaging time within 24 hours. There remains room for improvement for timely brain imaging among patients with acute symptom onset.

AB  - To describe the development and initial application of the Chronic Pain Coding System.Secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial.Six primary care clinics in northern California.Forty-five primary care visits involving 33 clinicians and 45 patients on opioids for chronic noncancer pain.The authors developed a structured coding system to accurately and objectively characterize discussions about pain and opioids. Two coders applied the final system to visit transcripts. Intercoder agreement for major coding categories was moderate to substantial (kappa = 0.5-0.7). Mixed effects regression was used to test six hypotheses to assess preliminary construct validity.Greater baseline pain interference was associated with longer pain discussions (P = 0.007) and more patient requests for clinician action (P = 0.02) but not more frequent negative patient evaluations of pain (P = 0.15). Greater clinician-reported visit difficulty was associated with more frequent disagreements with clinician recommendations (P = 0.003) and longer discussions of opioid risks (P = 0.049) but not more frequent requests for clinician action (P = 0.11). Rates of agreement versus disagreement with patient requests and clinician recommendations were similar for opioid-related and non-opioid-related utterances.This coding system appears to be a reliable and valid tool for characterizing patient-clinician communication about opioids and chronic pain during clinic visits. Objective data on how patients and clinicians discuss chronic pain and opioids are necessary to identify communication patterns and strategies for improving the quality and productivity of discussions about chronic pain that may lead to more effective pain management and reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing.

AB  - Objectives To analyze the costs for long‐stay (&gt;90 days) nursing home ( NH ) decedents with and without hospice care. Design Retrospective cohort study using a 1999–2009 data set of linked Medicare and Medicaid claims and minimum data set (MDS) assessments. Setting Indiana NH s. Participants Long‐stay NH decedents (N = 2,510). Measurements Medicare costs were calculated for 2, 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days before death; Medicaid costs were calculated for dual‐eligible beneficiaries. Total costs and costs for hospice, NH , and inpatient care are reported. Results Of 2,510 long‐stay NH decedents, 35% received hospice. Mean length of hospice was 103 days (median 34 days). Hospice users were more likely to have cancer ( P &lt; .001), a do‐not‐resuscitate order in place ( P &lt; .001), greater cognitive impairment ( P &lt; .001), and worse activity of daily living (ADL) function ( P &lt; .001) and less likely to have had a hospitalization in the year before death ( P &lt; .001). In propensity score analyses, hospice users had lower total Medicare costs for all time periods up to and including 90 days before death. For dually eligible beneficiaries, overall costs and Medicare costs were significantly lower for hospice users up to 30 days before death. Medicaid costs were not different between the groups except for the 2‐day time period. Conclusion In this analysis of costs to Medicare and Medicaid for long‐stay NH decedents, use of hospice did not increase costs in the last 6 months of life. Evidence supporting cost savings is sensitive to analyses that vary the time period before death.

AB  - Background. Chronic pain is a common and disabling comorbidity in individuals living with HIV. Behavioral interventions are among the most effective and safe nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain. However, the success of a behavioral intervention is influenced by how well it is tailored to the target population’s biological, psychological, and social context. Given well-documented psychosocial vulnerabilities among persons with HIV, it is critical to develop a behavioral intervention for chronic pain tailored to this population. Objective. To use qualitative methods to investigate patient preferences for the structure and delivery of a behavioral intervention for chronic pain in individuals with HIV. Methods. Interviews and focus groups were used to elicit participant preferences. A thematic analysis approach, with an initial round of open coding, was used to develop the codebook and analyze the data. Results. Qualitative data from 12 interviews and 3 focus groups with patients living with HIV and chronic pain (total N = 24) were analyzed. Emergent themes fell into four major categories: perceived value of group sessions, incorporating peer leadership, and two key elements of how the intervention should be delivered: the HIV status of group participants and views on phone-delivered intervention content. Discussion. This study provides a framework for the structure and delivery of a behavioral intervention for chronic pain in individuals with HIV based on patient preferences. We will use these results to design our intervention, and hope that our approach informs the work of investigators in other disciplines who seek to incorporate patient preferences during intervention development.

AB  - Futility disputes in the intensive care unit setting have received significant attention in the literature over the past several years. Although the idea of improving communication in an attempt to resolve these challenging situations has been regularly discussed, the concept and role of trust building as the means by which communication improves and disputes are best navigated is largely absent. We take this opportunity to review the current literature on futility disputes and argue the important role of broken trust in these encounters, highlighting current evidence establishing the necessity and utility of trust in both medical decision-making and effective communication. Finally, we propose a futility dispute navigation model built upon improved communication through trust building.

AB  - Background: Although recent literature has explored the relationship between various environmental market characteristics and the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) among general, acute care hospitals, no such research currently exists for specialty hospitals, including those providing cancer care. Purpose: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between market characteristics and the adoption of EHRs among Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited hospitals. Methods/Approach: Secondary data on EHR adoption combined with hospital and environmental market characteristics were analyzed using logistic regression. Using the resource dependence theory, we examined how measures of munificence, complexity, and dynamism are related to the adoption of EHRs among CoC-accredited hospitals and, separately, hospitals not CoC-accredited. Findings: In a sample of 2,670 hospitals, 141 (0.05%) were academic-based CoC-accredited hospitals and 562 (21%) were community-based CoC-accredited hospitals. Measures of munificence such as cancer incidence rates ( OR = 0.99, CI [0.99, 1.00], p = .020) and percentage population aged 65+ ( OR = 0.99, CI [0.99, 1.00], p = .001) were negatively associated with basic EHR adoption, whereas urban location was positively associated with comprehensive EHR adoption ( OR = 3.07, CI [0.89, 10.61], p = .076) for community-based CoC-accredited hospitals. Measures of complexity such as hospitals in areas with less competition were less likely to adopt a basic EHR ( OR = 0.33, CI [0.19, 0.96], p = .005), whereas Medicare Managed Care penetration was positively associated with comprehensive EHR adoption ( OR = 1.02, CI [1.00, 1.05], p = .070) among community-based CoC-accredited hospitals. Lastly, dynamism, measured as population change, was negatively associated with the adoption of comprehensive EHRs ( OR = 0.99, CI [0.99, 1.00], p = .070) among academic-based CoC-accredited hospitals. Practice implications: A greater understanding of the environment’s relationship to health information technology adoption in cancer hospitals will help stakeholders in these institutions make informed strategic decisions about information technology investments guided by their facilities’ respective environmental factors. The results of this study may also be useful to hospital chief information officers and chief executive officers seeking to either improve their quality of care or achieve and maintain accreditation in providing cancer care.

AB  - Nearly 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors have depressive symptoms 2‐12 months after hospital discharge. We examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms and risk factors for depressive symptoms in 204 patients at their initial evaluation in the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC), an ICU survivor clinic based at Eskenazi Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. Thirty‐two percent (N = 65) of patients had depressive symptoms on initial CCRC visit. For patients who are not on an antidepressant at their initial CCRC visit (N = 135), younger age and lower education level were associated with a higher likelihood of having depressive symptoms. For patients on an antidepressant at their initial CCRC visit (N = 69), younger age and being African American race were associated with a higher likelihood of having depressive symptoms. Future studies will need to confirm these findings and examine new approaches to increase access to depression treatment and test new antidepressant regimens for post‐ICU depression.

AB  - Abstract Objective We describe a detailed solution for maintaining high-capacity, data-intensive network flows (eg, 10, 40, 100 Gbps+) in a scientific, medical context while still adhering to security and privacy laws and regulations. Materials and Methods High-end networking, packet-filter firewalls, network intrusion-detection systems. Results We describe a “Medical Science DMZ” concept as an option for secure, high-volume transport of large, sensitive datasets between research institutions over national research networks, and give 3 detailed descriptions of implemented Medical Science DMZs. Discussion The exponentially increasing amounts of “omics” data, high-quality imaging, and other rapidly growing clinical datasets have resulted in the rise of biomedical research “Big Data.” The storage, analysis, and network resources required to process these data and integrate them into patient diagnoses and treatments have grown to scales that strain the capabilities of academic health centers. Some data are not generated locally and cannot be sustained locally, and shared data repositories such as those provided by the National Library of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and international partners such as the European Bioinformatics Institute are rapidly growing. The ability to store and compute using these data must therefore be addressed by a combination of local, national, and industry resources that exchange large datasets. Maintaining data-intensive flows that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulations presents a new challenge for biomedical research. We describe a strategy that marries performance and security by borrowing from and redefining the concept of a Science DMZ, a framework that is used in physical sciences and engineering research to manage high-capacity data flows. Conclusion By implementing a Medical Science DMZ architecture, biomedical researchers can leverage the scale provided by high-performance computer and cloud storage facilities and national high-speed research networks while preserving privacy and meeting regulatory requirements.

AB  - Waist circumference (WC) is a stronger predictor of colon cancer (CRC) risk than body mass index (BMI). However, how well change in either WC or BMI predicts risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (AN) is unclear. To determine the relationship between change in BMI and WC from early adulthood to later age and the risk of AN and which change measure is a stronger predictor. In 4500 adults, ages 50–80, with no previous neoplasia and undergoing screening colonoscopy, BMI and WC at age 21 and at time of screening were reported. Changes in BMI and WC were defined using universal risk cutoffs. Known CRC risk factors were controlled in the logistic models. Overall, model statistics showed WC change (omnibus test χ 2 = 10.15, 2 DF, p value = 0.006) was a statistically stronger predictor of AN than BMI change (omnibus test χ 2 = 5.66, 5 DF, p value = 0.34). Independent of BMI change, participants who increased WC (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.05–1.96) or maintained a high-risk WC (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.38–4.53) at age 21 and at screening had an increased risk of AN compared to those with a low-risk WC. Study participants who were obese at age 21 and at screening had an increased risk of AN (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.08–3.23) compared to those who maintained a healthy BMI. Maintaining an overweight BMI or increasing BMI was not associated with AN. Maintaining an unhealthy BMI and WC throughout adult life may increase risk of AN. WC change may be a better predictor of AN than BMI change.

AB  - Many ischemic stroke patients do not achieve goal blood pressure ( BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg). To identify barriers to post‐stroke hypertension management, we examined healthcare utilization and BP control in the year after index ischemic stroke admission. This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke to a VA hospital in fiscal year 2011 and who were discharged with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. One‐year post‐discharge, BP trajectories, utilization of primary care, specialty and ancillary services were studied. Among 265 patients, 246 (92.8%) were seen by primary care ( PC ) during the 1‐year post‐discharge; a median time to the first PC visit was 32 days (interquartile range: 53). Among N = 245 patients with post‐discharge BP data, 103 (42.0%) achieved a mean BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg in the year post‐discharge. Provider follow‐ups were: neurology (51.7%), cardiology (14.0%), nephrology (7.2%), endocrinology (3.8%), and geriatrics (2.6%) and ancillary services ( BP monitor [30.6%], pharmacy [20.0%], nutrition [8.3%], and telehealth [8%]). Non‐adherence to medications was documented in 21.9% of patients and was observed more commonly among patients with uncontrolled compared with controlled BP (28.7% vs 15.5%; P = .02). The recurrent stroke rate did not differ among patients with uncontrolled (4.2%) compared with controlled BP (3.8%; P = .89). Few patients achieved goal BP in the year post‐stroke. Visits to primary care were not timely. Underuse of specialty as well as ancillary services and provider perception of medication non‐adherence were common. Future intervention studies seeking to improve post‐stroke hypertension management should address these observed gaps in care.

AB  - Objective To present revised core competencies for doctoral programs in health services research ( HSR ), modalities to deliver these competencies, and suggested methods for assessing mastery of these competencies. Data Sources and Data Collection Core competencies were originally developed in 2005, updated (but unpublished) in 2008, modestly updated for a 2016 HSR workforce conference, and revised based on feedback from attendees. Additional feedback was obtained from doctoral program directors, employer/workforce experts and attendees of presentation on these competencies at the AcademyHealth's June 2017 Annual Research Meeting. Principal Findings The current version (V2.1) competencies include the ethical conduct of research, conceptual models, development of research questions, study designs, data measurement and collection methods, statistical methods for analyzing data, professional collaboration, and knowledge dissemination. These competencies represent a core that defines what HSR researchers should master in order to address the complexities of microsystem to macro‐system research that HSR entails. There are opportunities to conduct formal evaluation of newer delivery modalities (e.g., flipped classrooms) and to integrate new Learning Health System Researcher Core Competencies, developed by AHRQ , into the HSR core competencies. Conclusions Core competencies in HSR are a continually evolving work in progress because new research questions arise, new methods are developed, and the trans‐disciplinary nature of the field leads to new multidisciplinary and team building needs.

AB  - Abstract Objective Pain self-management information and support, delivered by peers, are a potentially useful approach to help patients who are struggling to manage their chronic pain. Before implementation into clinical settings, it is important to understand factors that may influence the success of implementation. The purpose of this study was to explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of peer support for chronic pain. Design Semistructured interviews were conducted with clinicians who provide care to patients with chronic pain, regarding their perceptions of the proposed peer support intervention. Setting A single US Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Subjects Using maximum variation sampling, 15 providers were interviewed (11 women, four men). Clinicians’ disciplines included primary care, physical therapy, nursing, clinical psychology, social work, and pharmacy. Results Findings indicated that clinicians 1) had an overall positive perception of the intervention; 2) had specific intervention outcomes they wanted for patients; 3) anticipated that the intervention could positively influence their role; 4) anticipated barriers to intervention participation and maintenance; and 5) had concerns regarding peer coach selection. Findings are discussed in the context of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Conclusions Understanding clinician perceptions of a peer support intervention is critical for successful implementation. The feedback collected in this study will facilitate implementation of the intervention on a broader scale, allowing more patients to benefit.

AB  - Abstract A robust biomedical informatics infrastructure is essential for academic health centers engaged in translational research. There are no templates for what such an infrastructure encompasses or how it is funded. An informatics workgroup within the Clinical and Translational Science Awards network conducted an analysis to identify the scope, governance, and funding of this infrastructure. After we identified the essential components of an informatics infrastructure, we surveyed informatics leaders at network institutions about the governance and sustainability of the different components. Results from 42 survey respondents showed significant variations in governance and sustainability; however, some trends also emerged. Core informatics components such as electronic data capture systems, electronic health records data repositories, and related tools had mixed models of funding including, fee-for-service, extramural grants, and institutional support. Several key components such as regulatory systems (e.g., electronic Institutional Review Board [IRB] systems, grants, and contracts), security systems, data warehouses, and clinical trials management systems were overwhelmingly supported as institutional infrastructure. The findings highlighted in this report are worth noting for academic health centers and funding agencies involved in planning current and future informatics infrastructure, which provides the foundation for a robust, data-driven clinical and translational research program.

AB  - Poor communication during end-of-shift transfers of care (handoffs) is associated with safety risks and patient harm. Despite the common perception that handoffs are largely a one-way transfer of information, researchers have documented that they are complex interactions, guided by implicit social norms and mental frameworks.We investigated communication strategies that resident physicians report deploying to tailor information during face-to-face handoffs that are often based on their implicit inferences about the perceived information needs and potential harm to patients.We interviewed 35 residents in Medicine and Surgery wards at three VA Medical Centers (VAMCs).We conducted qualitative interviews using audio-recorded semi-structured cognitive task interviews.The effectiveness of handoff communication depends upon three factors: receiver characteristics, type of shift, and patient's condition and perceived acuity. Receiver characteristics, including subjective perceptions about an incoming resident's training or ability levels and their assumed preferences for information (e.g., detailed/comprehensive vs. minimal/"big picture"), influenced content shared during handoffs. Residents handing off to the night team provided more information about patients' medical histories and care plans than residents handing off to the day team, and higher patient acuity merited more detailed information and the medical service(s) involved dictated the types of information conveyed.We found that handoff communication involves a complex combination of socio-technical information where residents balance relational factors against content and risk. It is not a mechanistic process of merely transferring clinical data but rather is based on learned habits of communication that are context-sensitive and variable, what we refer to as "recipient design." Interventions should focus on raising awareness of times when information is omitted, customized, or expanded based on implicit judgments, the emerging threats such judgments pose to patient care and quality, and the competencies needed to be more explicit in handoff interactions.

AB  - Dentists are more often treating patients with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) in their clinics; therefore, dentists may need to alter treatment plans in the presence of CVD. However, it's unclear to what extent patient-reported CVD information is accurately captured in Electronic Dental Records (EDRs). In this pilot study, we aimed to measure the reliability of patient-reported CVD conditions in EDRs. We assessed information congruence by comparing patients' self-reported dental histories to their original diagnosis assigned by their medical providers in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). To enable this comparison, we encoded patients CVD information from the free-text data of EDRs into a structured format using natural language processing (NLP). Overall, our NLP approach achieved promising performance extracting patients' CVD-related information. We observed disagreement between self-reported EDR data and physician-diagnosed EMR data.

AB  - Abstract Few investigations examine patterns of opioid and nonopioid analgesic prescribing and concurrent pain intensity ratings before and after institution of safer prescribing programs such as the October 2013 Veterans Health Administration system-wide Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) implementation. We conducted a quasi-experimental pre–post observational study of all older U.S. veterans (≥50 years old) with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. All associated outpatient analgesic prescriptions and outpatient pain intensity ratings from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016, were analyzed with segmented regression of interrupted time series. Standardized monthly rates for each analgesic class (total, opioid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, acetaminophen, and other study analgesics) were analyzed with segmented negative binomial regression models with overall slope, step, and slope change. Similarly, segmented linear regression was used to analyze pain intensity ratings and percentage of those reporting pain. All models were additionally adjusted for age, sex, and race. Before OSI implementation, total analgesic prescriptions showed a steady rise, abruptly decreasing to a flat trajectory after OSI implementation. This trend was primarily due to a decrease in opioid prescribing after OSI. Total prescribing after OSI implementation was partially compensated by continuing increased prescribing of other study analgesics as well as a significant rise in acetaminophen prescriptions (post-OSI). No changes in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing were seen. A small rise in the percentage of those reporting pain but not mean pain intensity ratings continued over the study period with no changes associated with OSI. Changes in analgesic prescribing trends were not paralleled by changes in reported pain intensity for older veterans with osteoarthritis.

AB  - Many studies identify factors that contribute to renal prescribing errors, but few examine how healthcare professionals (HCPs) detect and recover from an error or potential patient safety concern. Knowledge of this information could inform advanced error detection systems and decision support tools that help prevent prescribing errors.To examine the cognitive strategies that HCPs used to recognise and manage medication-related problems for patients with renal insufficiency.HCPs submitted documentation about medication-related incidents. We then conducted cognitive task analysis interviews. Qualitative data were analysed inductively.Inpatient and outpatient facilities at a major US Veterans Affairs Medical Centre.Physicians, nurses and pharmacists who took action to prevent or resolve a renal-drug problem in patients with renal insufficiency.Emergent themes from interviews, as related to recognition of renal-drug problems and decision-making processes.We interviewed 20 HCPs. Results yielded a descriptive model of the decision-making process, comprised of three main stages: detect, gather information and act. These stages often followed a cyclical path due largely to the gradual decline of patients' renal function. Most HCPs relied on being vigilant to detect patients' renal-drug problems rather than relying on systems to detect unanticipated cues. At each stage, HCPs relied on different cognitive cues depending on medication type: for renally eliminated medications, HCPs focused on gathering renal dosing guidelines, while for nephrotoxic medications, HCPs investigated the need for particular medication therapy, and if warranted, safer alternatives.Our model is useful for trainees so they can gain familiarity with managing renal-drug problems. Based on findings, improvements are warranted for three aspects of healthcare systems: (1) supporting the cyclical nature of renal-drug problem management via longitudinal tracking mechanisms, (2) providing tools to alleviate HCPs' heavy reliance on vigilance and (3) supporting HCPs' different decision-making needs for renally eliminated versus nephrotoxic medications.

AB  - Despite their availability without prescription, OTC medications pose a risk for significant harm for older adults due to higher likelihood of polypharmacy, drug interactions, and age-related physiological changes. The purpose of this study is to identify the individual decision factors that influence how older adults select and use over-the-counter medications. A pilot study was conducted with 20 community-dwelling older adults. Older adults met the interviewer at a regional mass merchandise store where they were given both pain and insomnia standardized scenarios. Participants described how they would select and then hypothetically use a given medication to treat the problem described in the scenario. OTC medication selection and reported use were influenced by several person-level decision-making factors including: personal beliefs/knowledge about OTCs, assessment of the ailment, and medical constraints. The findings from this investigation provide direction for interventions to address unsafe OTC medication selection by older adults.

AB  - When working with surrogate decision-makers, physicians often encounter ethical challenges that may cause moral distress which can have negative consequences for physicians. To determine frequency of and factors associated with physicians’ moral distress caring for patients requiring a surrogate. Prospective survey. Physicians (n = 154) caring for patients aged 65 years and older and their surrogate decision-makers (n = 362 patient/surrogate dyads). Patients were admitted to medicine or medical intensive care services, lacked decisional capacity and had an identified surrogate. Moral distress thermometer. Physicians experienced moral distress in the care of 152 of 362 patients (42.0%). In analyses adjusted for physician, patient, and surrogate characteristics, physician/surrogate discordance in preferences for the plan of care was not significantly associated with moral distress. Physicians were more likely to experience moral distress when caring for older patients (1.06, 1.02–1.10), and facing a decision about life-sustaining treatment (3.58, 1.54–8.32). Physicians were less likely to experience moral distress when caring for patients residing in a nursing home (0.40, 0.23–0.69), patients who previously discussed care preferences (0.56, 0.35–0.90), and higher surrogate ratings of emotional support from clinicians (0.94, 0.89–0.99). Physicians’ internal discordance when they prefer a more comfort-focused plan than the patient is receiving was associated with significantly higher moral distress (2.22, 1.33–3.70) after adjusting for patient, surrogate, and physician characteristics. Physician moral distress occurs more frequently when the physician is male, the patient is older or requires decisions about life-sustaining treatments. These findings may help target interventions to support physicians. Prior discussions about patient wishes is associated with lower distress and may be a target for patient-centered interventions.

AB  - Abstract Background Little is known about the impact of reclassification on patients’ perception of medical uncertainty or trust in genetics‐based clinical care. Methods Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 20 patients who had received a reclassified genetic test result related to hereditary cancer. All participants had undergone genetic counseling and testing for cancer susceptibility at Vanderbilt‐Ingram Cancer Center Hereditary Cancer Clinic within the last six years. Results Most of the participants did not express distress related to the variant reclassification and only a minority expressed a decrease in trust in medical genetics. However, recall of the new interpretation was limited, even though all participants were recontacted by letter, phone, or clinic visit. Conclusion Reclassification of genetic tests is an important issue in modern healthcare because changes in interpretation have the potential to alter previously recommended management. Participants in this study did not express strong feelings of mistrust or doubt about their genetic evaluation. However, there was a low level of comprehension and information retention related to the updated report. Future research can build on this study to improve communication with patients about their reclassified results.

AB  - Although growing, the prevalence of the use of health information technology (HIT) by patients to communicate with their providers is not well understood on the population level, nor whether patients are communicating with their providers about their use of HIT. To understand whether patients are communicating with their providers about HIT use and the patient characteristics associated with the communication. Cross-sectional, self-administered survey of a sample of patients across the state of Indiana. Nine hundred seventy adult participants from across Indiana, 54% female and 79.5% white. The survey included sections assessing health information-seeking behavior, use of health information technology, and discussions with doctors about the use of HIT. The survey had a 12% response rate. Sixty-three percent of respondent reported going to the Internet as the first source when seeking health information, while only 19% of respondent reported their doctor was their first source. When communicating with doctors electronically, 31% reported using an electronic health record messaging system, 24% used email, and 18% used text messaging. Only 39% of respondents reported having had any conversation about HIT use with their providers. There remain many unmet opportunities for patients and providers to communicate about HIT use. More guidance for patients and care teams may both help facilitate these conversations and promote optimal use, such as recommendations to ask simple clarification questions and minimize inefficient, synchronous communication when unnecessary.

AB  - The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Consortium integrated biorepository-based research with electronic health records (EHR) to return results from large-scale genetic tests to participants and uploaded those data into the EHR. This article explores the ethical issues investigators encountered in that process. We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with study personnel of the eMERGE-III Consortium sites that returned results. We discuss major ethical issues that arose while attempting to return research results from the eMERGE Consortium to individual participants. These included difficulties recontacting those participants who had not explicitly consented to such and disclosing results to many participants with insufficient infrastructure and staff. Investigators reported being driven by a supererogatory clinical impulse. All these issues ultimately derive from ethical conflicts inherent to translational work being done at the interface of research and clinical care. A critical rethinking of this divide is important, but infrastructural support for such work is necessary for an ethically sound rollout of large-scale genetic testing.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that elevated neutrophils, monocytes, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be associated with poor outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We sought to determine whether white blood cell (WBC) types were independently associated with poor outcome in ICH in a large cohort.We performed a retrospective study of primary ICH at two academic centers. Cases were identified via ICD-9 code and verified via physician review. We included only those patients with WBC types obtained within 24 h of ICH onset.We identified 593 patients with primary ICH and WBC differentials in the first 24 h. Independent factors (OR, 95% CI) associated with 30-day case fatality were age > 80 (2.4 (1.4, 4.2)), p = 0.0023; NIHSS greater than median (3.9 (2.4, 6.3)), p < 0.0001; ICH volume quartiles (Q1: ref, Q2: 1.5 (0.7, 3.0), Q3: 3.2 (1.6, 6.6), Q4: 11.9 (5.3, 26.4)), p < 0.0001; non-lobar location (3.3 (1.9, 5.9)), p ≤ 0.0001; IVH (2.3 (1.4, 3.6)), p = 0.0005, monocytes greater than median (1.6 (1.0, 2.4)), p = 0.0457, and anticoagulant use (3.2 (1.8, 5.6)), p < 0.0001. Elevated NLR was not associated with higher case fatality.We found that elevated monocytes were independently associated with 30-day case fatality. Future studies will investigate whether there are subgroups of ICH patients, including those with particular blood or imaging biomarkers, in which WBC types might help predict poor outcome and provide targets for intervention.

AB  - Pain self-management is an effective, evidence-based treatment for chronic pain. Peer support, in which patients serve as coaches for other patients, has been effective in other chronic conditions and is a potentially promising approach to implementing pain self-management programs using fewer clinical resources.To test a peer coach-delivered pain self-management program for chronic pain.Randomized controlled trial.Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain.Intervention patients were assigned a trained peer coach for 6 months. Coaches, who were volunteers, were asked to contact their assigned patients, either by phone or in person, twice per month. Coaches and patients were given an intervention manual to guide sessions. The control group was offered a 2-hour pain self-management class.The primary outcome was total pain, assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, self-efficacy, social support, patient activation, health-related quality of life, and healthcare utilization. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months.Two hundred fifteen patients enrolled (120 intervention, 95 control). Adherence to intervention protocol was low, with only 13% of patients reporting having at least the recommended 12 peer coach meetings over the 6-month intervention. BPI total decreased from baseline to 6 months and baseline to 9 months in both groups. At 9 months, this change was statistically significant (intervention, - 0.40, p = 0.018; control, - 0.47, p = 0.006). There was not a statistically significant difference between groups on BPI at either time point. No secondary outcomes improved significantly in either group after adjusting for multiple comparisons.Patients randomized to peer support did not differ from control patients on primary and secondary outcomes. Other peer support models that do not rely on volunteers might be more effective.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02380690.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to determine whether consistent food assistance program participation or changes in participation over time mediated or moderated the effect of federal nutrition education through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) on food security and determine the associations of SNAP-Ed program delivery characteristics with change in food security. This secondary analysis used data from a randomized controlled trial from September 2013 through April 2015. SNAP-Ed-eligible participants (n = 328; ≥18 years) in households with children were recruited from 39 counties in Indiana, USA. The dependent variable was one year change in household food security score measured using the United States Household Food Security Survey Module. Assessment of mediation used Barron-Kenny analysis and moderation used interactions of food assistance program use and changes over time with treatment group in general linear regression modeling. Program delivery characteristics were investigated using mixed linear regression modeling. Results showed that neither consistent participation nor changes in food assistance program participation over time mediated nor moderated the effect of SNAP-Ed on food security and neither were SNAP-Ed program delivery characteristics associated with change in food security over the one year study period. SNAP-Ed directly improved food security among SNAP-Ed-eligible Indiana households with children regardless of food assistance program participation and changes over time or varying program delivery characteristics.

AB  - Abstract Objective Biomedical informatics attracts few underrepresented racial minorities (URMs) into PhD programs. We examine graduation trends from 2002 to 2017 to determine how URM representation has changed over time. We also examine academic job placements by race and identify individual and institutional characteristics associated with URM graduates being successfully placed in academic jobs. Materials and Methods We analyze a near census of all research doctoral graduates from US-accredited institutions, surveyed at graduation by the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates. Graduates of biomedical informatics-related programs were identified using self-reported primary and secondary disciplines. Data are analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions. Results During the study period, 2426 individuals earned doctoral degrees in biomedical informatics-related disciplines. URM students comprised nearly 12% of graduates, and this proportion did not change over time (2002–2017). URMs included Hispanic (5.7%), Black (3.2%), and others, including multi-racial and indigenous American populations (2.8%). Overall, 82.3% of all graduates accepted academic positions at the time of graduation with significantly more Hispanic graduates electing to go into academia (89.2%; P &amp;lt; .001). URM graduates were more likely to be single (OR = 1.38; P &amp;lt; .05), have a dependent (1.95; P &amp;lt; .01), and not receive full tuition remission (OR = 1.37; P = .05) as a student. URM graduates accepting an academic position were less likely to be a graduate of a private institution (OR = 0.70; P &amp;lt; .05). Discussion and Conclusion The proportion of URM candidates among biomedical informatics doctoral graduates has not increased over time and remains low. In order to improve URM recruitment and retention within academia, leaders in biomedical informatics should replicate strategies used to improve URM graduation rates in other fields.

AB  - Antenatal corticosteroids improve newborn outcomes for preterm infants. However, predicting which women presenting for threatened preterm labor will have preterm infants is inaccurate, and many women receive antenatal corticosteroids but then go on to deliver at term.This study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of infants born at term to women who received betamethasone for threatened preterm labor with infants who were not exposed to betamethasone in utero.We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants born at or after 37 weeks' gestational age to mothers diagnosed as having threatened preterm labor during pregnancy. The primary neonatal outcomes of interest included transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and small for gestational age and were evaluated for their association with betamethasone exposure while adjusting for covariates using multiple logistic regression.Of 5330 women, 1459 women (27.5%) received betamethasone at a mean gestational age of 32.2±3.3 weeks. The mean age of women was 27±5.9 years and the mean gestational age at delivery was 38.9±1.1 weeks. Women receiving betamethasone had higher rates of maternal comorbidities (P<.001 for diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertensive disorder) and were more likely to self-identify as White (P=.022). Betamethasone-exposed neonates had increased rates of transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal intensive care unit admission, small for gestational age, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoglycemia (all, P<.05). Controlling for maternal characteristics and gestational age at delivery, betamethasone exposure was not associated with a diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn (adjusted odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.51), although it was associated with more neonatal intensive care unit admissions (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.86) and higher odds of the baby being small for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.14).Compared with women evaluated for preterm labor who did not receive betamethasone, women receiving betamethasone had infants with higher rates of neonatal intensive care unit admission and small for gestational age. Although the benefits of betamethasone to infants born preterm are clear, there may be negative impacts for infants delivered at term.

AB  - Older adults are at greater risk of both infection with and mortality from COVID-19. Many U.S. nursing homes have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet little has been described regarding the typical disease course in this population. The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID-19.This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID-19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28 and June 17, 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31, 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents.The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over 3 weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID-19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID-19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course.Nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post-disease. Future studies should combine data from nursing home residents across the country to identify the risk factors for disease trajectories identified in this case series.

AB  - Background This study examined the prevalence and longitudinal course of depression during the first year after mild to moderate stroke. Methods and Results We identified patients with mild to moderate ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score <16) and at least 1 depression assessment at 3, 6, or 12 months after stroke (n=648, 542, and 533, respectively) from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (2014-2016). Latent transition analysis was used to examine temporal profiles of depressive symptoms assessed by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire between 3 and 12 months after stroke. Mean age was 65.6 years, 49.4% were women, and 56.7% were Mexican Americans. The prevalence of depression after stroke was 35.3% at 3 months, decreased to 24.9% at 6 months, and remained stable at 25.7% at 12 months. Approximately half of the participants classified as having depression at 3 or 6 months showed clinical improvement at the next assessment. Subgroups with distinct patterns of depressive symptoms were identified, including mild/no symptoms, predominant sleep disturbance and fatigue symptoms, affective symptoms, and severe/all symptoms. A majority of participants with mild/no symptoms retained this symptom pattern over time. The probability of transitioning to mild/no symptoms was higher before 6 months compared with the later period, and severe symptoms were more likely to persist after 6 months compared with the earlier period. Conclusions The observed dynamics of depressive symptoms suggest that depression after stroke tends to persist after 6 months among patients with mild to moderate stroke and should be continually monitored and appropriately managed.

AB  - Fatigue often interferes with functioning in patients with advanced cancer, resulting in increased family caregiver burden. Acceptance and commitment therapy, a promising intervention for cancer-related suffering, has rarely been applied to dyads coping with advanced cancer.To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for patient-caregiver dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Primary outcomes were patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden.In this pilot trial, dyads were randomized to six weekly sessions of telephone-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy or education/support, an attention control. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.Forty patients with stage III-IV gastrointestinal cancer and fatigue interference and family caregivers with burden or distress were recruited from two oncology clinics and randomized.The eligibility screening rate (54%) and retention rate (81% at 2 weeks post-intervention) demonstrated feasibility. At 2 weeks post-intervention, acceptance and commitment therapy participants reported high intervention helpfulness (mean = 4.25/5.00). Group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. However, when examining within-group change, acceptance and commitment therapy patients showed moderate decline in fatigue interference at both follow-ups, whereas education/support patients did not show improvement at either follow-up. Acceptance and commitment therapy caregivers showed medium decline in burden at 2 weeks that was not sustained at 3 months, whereas education/support caregivers showed little change in burden.Acceptance and commitment therapy showed strong feasibility, acceptability, and promise and warrants further testing.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04010227.

AB  - Reports of perforation risk related to intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted immediately post partum and among non-post-partum individuals are scarce, and previous studies with only 12-month follow-ups underestimate the risk. Breastfeeding at IUD insertion and insertion within 36 weeks post partum have been associated with increased risk of uterine perforation. The aim of these analyses was to compare the incidence and risks of IUD-related uterine perforations by non-post-partum and post-partum intervals at IUD insertion, and among post-partum individuals, to assess the impact of breastfeeding on these outcomes.We did a multisite cohort study in the USA, using electronic health records (EHR). Study sites were three health-care systems and a site that used data from a health-care information exchange. The study population included individuals who were aged 50 years or younger and had an IUD insertion between Jan 1, 2001, and April 30, 2018. Individuals were excluded if they had not been in the health-care system for at least 12 months before IUD insertion. The primary outcome for this analysis was any IUD-related uterine perforation diagnosis for the first IUD insertion in this time period. Both complete and partial IUD-related perforations were identified. Chart abstraction was done to validate EHR-based algorithms or confirm perforations. The crude rate and cumulative incidence of uterine perforation were evaluated by non-post-partum and post-partum intervals at IUD insertion in the full cohort, and by breastfeeding status in a subcohort of post-partum individuals. Cox models estimated crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs).Data from 326 658 individuals in the full cohort and 94 817 individuals in the post-partum subcohort were analysed. In the full cohort, we identified 1008 uterine perforations (51·2% complete), with the 5-year cumulative incidence being the lowest in the non-post-partum group (0·29%, 95% CI 0·26-0·34). The aHR for the post-partum interval relative to non-post partum ranged from 2·73 (95% CI 1·33-5·63; 0 to 3 days post partum) to 6·71 (4·80-9·38; 4 days to ≤6 weeks post partum). The post-partum subcohort of individuals with breastfeeding information had 673 uterine perforations (62% complete), with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 1·37% (95% CI 1·24-1·52) and an increased risk with breastfeeding (aHR 1·37, 95% CI 1·12-1·66).Although the risk for uterine perforation with IUD insertion 4 days to 6 weeks or less post partum is nearly seven times that of insertion non-post partum, perforation remains an incredibly rare event for all clinical time points. Despite a slight increased risk of perforation with breastfeeding at IUD insertion, the benefits of breastfeeding and effective contraception generally outweigh risks and should have little clinical impact. Therefore, IUD insertion timing should be based on individual desire for IUD contraception and patient convenience to assure an IUD insertion can occur. Careful follow-up of individuals at higher risk of uterine perforation is warranted.Bayer AG.

All-cause mortality of black and white women was compared using hazard ratios derived from a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.There was no significant difference between older black and white women in surgical treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy over the study period. Race was not a significant predictor of survival in the Cox proportional hazards model that controlled for stage of cancer, age at diagnosis, dual-eligibility status, comorbid conditions, body mass index, smoking history, mammogram screening, and treatment for breast cancer.Race did not appear to affect treatment or mortality in a cohort of older women with low socioeconomic status. This may be associated with similar healthcare delivery and equivalent access to health care for the older black and white women in this study.

AB  - Good oral health improves quality of life and is an integral part of active aging. Similar to some other systemic diseases, mood disorders are more prevalent in middle to older ages and have an associated risk of developing poor oral health. Consequently, people with mood disorders need to have regular dental care. There is scarce evidence in Canada linking mood disorders to the use of professional oral care services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between mood disorders and utilization of oral health-care services in a population-based sample of middle aged and older adults in Canada.Data were extracted from Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging, 2008. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the association between mood disorders and oral care utilization, adjusted for the confounders.Among 30,354 respondents included in our sample, 2162 (6.9%) reported having mood disorders. After adjusting for age, sex, education, marital status, and dental insurance status, the respondents who had mood disorders had a significant increased odds of not visiting a dental professional in the past year (OR:1.21, 95% CI: 1.08-1.35). The association of never visiting a dental professional and mood disorders was even stronger (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.91-2.46).Mood disorders were found to have a strong association with underutilization of oral care services among aging adults of Canada. Given the associated poor oral health risks for elderly with mood disorders, oral health planners should strengthen the implementation of surveillance programs directed toward better oral health for this disadvantaged subpopulation.

AB  - Despite extensive research funding in the field of dementia, deficits in the quality of dementia care still exist. In order to project different alternative futures of health care for people with dementia (PwD) in Germany, we have initiated a multidisciplinary scenario process (Sce-Dem).For the scenario process we used a 6-step approach: (1) identification of relevant areas of influences via literature review and internet search, (2) systematic collection of relevant influence factors and their future projections via literature review, brainstorming and consensus workshops, (3) discussion and validation of the identified key factors in a workshop with 52 multidisciplinary, experts, to clarify their characteristics and future projections, (4) combining the relevant key factors with alternative projections in a so-called consistency matrix to estimate the consistency between the selected projections, (5) generating consistent combinations of projections using software, and (6) writing scenario stories and descriptions based on the most consistent and different combinations.As a result of the scenario process, five consistent scenarios were developed. Two of these could be described as dark scenarios with very poor prospects. A third one has been referred to as "well-meant, but badly done". Two scenarios entail mostly positive aspects but one of them has a tendency towards, a "health control" state.The more positive scenarios provide a framework for determining relevant actions in research, society, and politics.

AB  - This article reports redesign strategies identified to create a Web-based user-interface for the Self-management TO Prevent (STOP) Stroke Tool. Members of a Stroke Quality Improvement Network (N = 12) viewed a visualization video of a proposed prototype and provided feedback on implementation barriers/facilitators. Stroke-care providers (N = 10) tested the Web-based prototype in think-aloud sessions of simulated clinic visits. Participants’ dialogues were coded into themes. Access to comprehensive information and the automated features/systematized processes were the primary accessibility and usability facilitator themes. The need for training, time to complete the tool, and computer-centric care were identified as possible usability barriers. Patient accountability, reminders for best practice, goal-focused care, and communication/counseling themes indicate that the STOP Stroke Tool supports the paradigm of patient-centered care. The STOP Stroke Tool was found to prompt clinicians on secondary stroke-prevention clinical-practice guidelines, facilitate comprehensive documentation of evidence-based care, and support clinicians in providing patient-centered care through the shared decision-making process that occurred while using the action-planning/goal-setting feature of the tool.

AB  - A cloud-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) was implemented to remotely provide evidence-based guideline reminders in support of preventative health. Following implementation, we measured the agreement between preventive care reminders generated by an existing, local CDSS and the new, cloud-based CDSS operating on the same patient visit data. Electronic health record data for the same set of patients seen in primary care were sent to both the cloud-based web service and local CDSS. The clinical reminders returned by both services were captured for analysis. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was calculated to compare the two sets of reminders. Kappa statistics were further adjusted for prevalence and bias due to the potential effects of bias in the CDS logic and prevalence in the relative small sample of patients. The cloud-based CDSS generated 965 clinical reminders for 405 patient visits over 3 months. The local CDSS returned 889 reminders for the same patient visit data. When adjusted for prevalence and bias, observed agreement varied by reminder from 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 – 0.42) to 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 – 1.00) and demonstrated almost perfect agreement for 7 of the 11 reminders. Preventive care reminders delivered by two disparate CDS systems show substantial agreement. Subtle differences in rule logic and terminology mapping appear to account for much of the discordance. Cloud-based CDSS therefore show promise, opening the door for future development and implementation in support of health care providers with limited resources for knowledge management of complex logic and rules.

AB  - Abstract Background Healthcare providers sometimes receive multiple continuity of care documents (CCDs) for a single patient encompassing the patient’s various encounters and medical history recorded in different information systems. It is cumbersome for providers to explore different pages of CCDs to find specific data which can be duplicated or even conflicted. This study describes initial steps toward a modular system that integrates and de-duplicates multiple CCDs into one consolidated document for viewing or processing patient-level data. Materials and Methods The authors developed a prototype system to consolidate and de-duplicate CCDs. The system is engineered to be scalable, extensible, and open source. Using a corpus of 150 de-identified CCDs synthetically generated from a single data source with a common vocabulary to represent 50 unique patients, the authors tested the system’s performance and output. Performance was measured based on document throughput and reduction in file size and volume of data. The authors further compared the output of the system with manual consolidation and de-duplication. Testing across multiple vendor systems or implementations was not performed. Results All of the input CCDs was successfully consolidated, and no data were lost. De-duplication significantly reduced the number of entries in different sections (49% in Problems, 60.6% in Medications, and 79% in Allergies) and reduced the size of the documents (57.5%) as well as the number of lines in each document (58%). The system executed at a rate of approximately 0.009–0.03 s per rule depending on the complexity of the rule. Discussion and Conclusion Given increasing adoption and use of health information exchange (HIE) to share data and information across the care continuum, duplication of information is inevitable. A novel system designed to support automated consolidation and de-duplication of information across clinical documents as they are exchanged shows promise. Future work is needed to expand the capabilities of the system and further test it using heterogeneous vocabularies across multiple HIE scenarios.

AB  - The goal of the Determining Risk of Vascular Events by Apnea Monitoring (DREAM) study is to develop a prognostic model for cardiovascular outcomes, based on physiologic variables—related to breathing, sleep architecture, and oxygenation—measured during polysomnography in US veterans. The DREAM study is a multi-site, retrospective observational cohort study conducted at three Veterans Affairs (VA) centers (West Haven, CT; Indianapolis, IN; Cleveland, OH). Veterans undergoing polysomnography between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004 were included based on referral for evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing, documented history and physical prior to sleep testing, and ≥2-h sleep monitoring. Demographic, anthropomorphic, medical, medication, and social history factors were recorded. Measures to determine sleep apnea, sleep architecture, and oxygenation were recorded from polysomnography. VA Patient Treatment File, VA–Medicare Data, Vista Computerized Patient Record System, and VA Vital Status File were reviewed on dates subsequent to polysomnography, ranging from 0.06 to 8.8 years (5.5 ± 1.3 years; mean ± SD). The study population includes 1840 predominantly male, middle-aged veterans. As designed, the main primary outcome is the composite endpoint of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death. Secondary outcomes include incidents of neoplasm, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Laboratory outcomes include measures of glycemic control, cholesterol, and kidney function. (Actual results are pending.) This manuscript provides the rationale for the inclusion of veterans in a study to determine the association between physiologic sleep measures and cardiovascular outcomes and specifically the development of a corresponding outcome-based prognostic model.

AB  - Provider competence may affect the impact of a practice. The current study examined this relationship in sixty-three providers engaging in Illness Management and Recovery with 236 consumers. Improving upon previous research, the present study utilized a psychometrically validated competence measure in the ratings of multiple Illness Management and Recovery sessions from community providers, and mapped outcomes onto the theory underlying the practice. Provider competence was positively associated with illness self-management and adaptive coping. Results also indicated baseline self-management skills and working alliance may affect the relationship between competence and outcomes.

AB  - Background: Caregivers of persons with dementia are stressed. Stressors not related to care recipients’ needs impact caregiver outcomes, yet are seldom reported. The purpose of this study was to report the most stressful events experienced by spouse caregivers of older adults with Alzheimer s disease during a 6-month period. Methods: 31 caregivers completed the Most Stressful Event form, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Revised Memory Behavioral Problem Checklist (R-MBPC). Fisher’s exact test and two-sample t-test were used to compare Most Stressful Events between caregivers. ANOVA model tested whether the PHQ-9 and R-MBPC subscales differed by stressor. Results: Caregivers reported no stressors 21.5% of the time, 1-2 stressors 25% of the time, and 3 stressors 53% of the time with 318 stressors reported in total. Care recipient needs (30.2%), caregiver needs (26.7%), and decision-making (16.7%) were the most frequently reported stressors. Using a mixed effects model, there were associations between the Most Stressful Events and depression (p = 0.016), mobility (p = 0.024) and caregiver issues (p = 0.009) subscales of R-MBPC. Conclusion: Results can be used to develop targeted intervention and support strategies for spouse caregivers experiencing non-caregiving related stressorsas well as the traditional challenges with caregiving related issues.

AB  - National policies in the United States require the use of standard terminology for data exchange between clinical information systems. However, most electronic health record systems continue to use local and idiosyncratic ways of representing clinical observations. To improve mappings between local terms and standard vocabularies, we sought to make existing mappings (wisdom) from healt care organizations (the Crowd) available to individuals engaged in mapping processes. We developed new functionality to display counts of local terms and organizations that had previously mapped to a given Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code. Further, we enabled users to view the details of those mappings, including local term names and the organizations that create the mappings. Users also would have the capacity to contribute their local mappings to a shared mapping repository. In this article, we describe the new functionality and its availability to implementers who desire resources to make mapping more efficient and effective.

AB  - <h3>Background</h3> Understanding how physicians and other healthcare personnel respond to hospital performance feedback initiatives may have important implications for quality improvement efforts. Our objective was to explore responses to the inaugural feedback of hospital performance on stroke quality of care measures among relevant physicians and personnel at the US Department of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. <h3>Methods</h3> Qualitative interviews with hospital administrators, physicians, nurses and quality managers at 12 VHA hospitals in the USA after the inaugural national release of the report on quality of acute stroke care processes. Interview transcripts were analysed using an immersion/crystallisation approach to identify recurrent themes. <h3>Results</h3> Interviews were completed with 41 individuals at 12 VHA hospitals from diverse regions of the USA; the majority were clinicians, either physicians or nurses, and nearly all had 20 years of experience or more. Interviewees described general perceptions of internal performance feedback that were both positive and negative, such as the notion that performance feedback could provide value to clinicians and hospitals, but at the same time voiced concerns about being inundated with such data. Interviewees also expressed scepticism about public reporting of performance data, citing numerous concerns and limitations. However, when interviewees described specific experiences with performance feedback, nearly all reactions were positive, including excitement, interest and feeling validated about a job well done. <h3>Discussion</h3> Physicians and other healthcare personnel described hospital performance feedback on stroke quality of care measures to be broadly valuable but identified areas of concern related to the measurement process and public reporting.

AB  - Purpose: More physicians need to acquire the skills of primary palliative care. Medical students’ clerkship experiences with death, dying, and palliative care (DDPC), however, may create barriers to learning such skills during residency. Whether professional development is differentially affected by DDPC is unknown. This knowledge gap potentially hinders the development of educational strategies to optimize students’ preparedness for primary palliative care. Method: Third-year students submitted professionalism narratives (N = 4062) during their internal medicine clerkship between 2004 and 2011. We identified DDPC-related narratives and then randomly selected control narratives. Narratives were compared by valence (positive or negative) and professionalism-related themes. Results and Conclusion: Less than 10% of the narratives were related to DDPC, but the majority was positive. There was a significant overlap in professionalism themes between DDPC and control narratives. The results suggest student preparedness for primary palliative care may be improved by addressing the common professionalism challenges of clinical clerkships.

AB  - Summary Background: As healthcare moves towards technology-driven population health management, clinicians must adopt complex digital platforms to access health information and document care. Objectives: This study explored information literacy, a set of skills required to effectively navigate population health information systems, among primary care providers in one Veterans’ Affairs (VA) medical center. Methods: Information literacy was assessed during an 8-month randomized trial that tested a population health (panel) management intervention. Providers were asked about their use and comfort with two VA digital tools for panel management at baseline, 16 weeks, and post-intervention. An 8-item scale (range 0-40) was used to measure information literacy (Cronbach’s α=0.84). Scores between study arms and provider types were compared using paired t-tests and ANOVAs. Associations between self-reported digital tool use and information literacy were measured via Pearson’s correlations. Results: Providers showed moderate levels of information literacy (M= 27.4, SD 6.5). There were no significant differences in mean information literacy between physicians (M=26.4, SD 6.7) and nurses (M=30.5, SD 5.2, p=0.57 for difference), or between intervention (M=28.4, SD 6.5) and control groups (M=25.1, SD 6.2, p=0.12 for difference). Information literacy was correlated with higher rates of self-reported information system usage (r=0.547, p=0.001). Clinicians identified data access, accuracy, and interpretability as potential information literacy barriers. Conclusions: While exploratory in nature, cautioning generalizability, the study suggests that measuring and improving clinicians’ information literacy may play a significant role in the implementation and use of digital information tools, as these tools are rapidly being deployed to enhance communication among care teams, improve health care outcomes, and reduce overall costs.

AB  - Aldosterone acts to restrain the extracellular potassium (K+) concentration. Blacks have on average lower plasma aldosterone concentrations (PACs) than Whites. Whether this ethnic difference is associated with similar changes in the concentration of K+ is unclear. Subjects were Blacks and Whites from an observational study of blood pressure regulation. PAC was known to be significantly lower in Blacks than Whites. We sought to test the hypothesis that the concentration of K+ remains constant despite variability in PAC. Initial enrollment took place in childhood in 1986. Some of the original enrollees were studied again in adulthood: 160 healthy Blacks and 271 healthy Whites (ages 5 to 39 years; all were studied as children and as adults). Plasma renin activity [a biomarker of angiotensin II and, more proximally, extracellular fluid volume (ECFV)] and PAC were lower in Blacks (P < 0.0354 and P < 0.001, respectively, for all ages). At the same time no ethnic difference in levels of K+ was observed regardless of age. Plasma K+ concentration and PAC associated differently based on ethnicity: PAC increased in Blacks by 1.5–2.0 and in Whites by 2.3–3.0 ng/dl per mmol/l increase in K+ (P < 0.001). Lower aldosterone levels in Blacks did not translate into higher K+ concentrations. We speculate that reaching the right concentration of K+ was an endpoint of aldosterone production in the presence of varying levels of ECFV and angiotensin II.

AB  - This manuscript reviews high-impact, peer-reviewed studies published from January 2014 to March 2016 that are relevant to pain management in primary care. Given the recent release of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain” emphasizing the primacy of nonopioid treatment, we focused our review on nonopioid pain management. Narrative review of peer-reviewed literature. We searched three article summary services and queried expert contacts for high-impact, English-language studies related to the management of pain in adults in primary care. All authors reviewed 142 study titles to arrive at group consensus on article content domains. Within article domains, individual authors selected studies approved by the larger group according to their impact on primary care clinical practice, policy, and research, as well as quality of the study methods. Through iterative discussion, 12 articles were selected for detailed review, discussion, and presentation in this narrative review. We present key articles addressing each of six domains of pain management: pharmacotherapy for acute pain; interventional treatments; medical cannabis; complementary and integrative medicine; care management in chronic pain; and prevention. Within each section, we conclude with implications for pain management in primary care. There is growing evidence for multiple nonopioid treatment modalities available to clinicians for the management of pain in primary care. The dissemination and implementation of these studies, including innovative care management interventions, warrant additional study and support from clinicians, educators, and policy-makers.

AB  - The management of chronic health conditions such as heart failure is a complex process emerging from the activity of a network of individuals and artifacts. This article presents an activity theory–based secondary analysis of data from a geriatric heart failure management study. Twenty-one patients’ interviews and clinic visit observations were analyzed to uncover eight configurations of roles and activities involving patients, clinicians, and others in the sociotechnical network. For each configuration or activity pattern, we identify points of tension and propose guidelines for developing interventions for future computer-supported healthcare systems.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with median survival of 20% at 1 year. We conducted a retrospective study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel (NP)-based second-line chemotherapy in metastatic PDAC.The Indiana University Simon Cancer Center pancreatic cancer program was used to identify patients with metastatic PDAC who received any second-line chemotherapy. Demographic, clinical and outcomes data were collected by manual chart abstraction. Patients were divided into two groups: a NP-based treatment group and a non- NP-based treatment group. Overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for multivariate analyses.A total of 120 patients received second-line chemotherapy. There were 47 (39%) patients in the NP group and 73 (61%) in the non-NP group. As compared to the non-NP group, the NP group showed improved median PFS [2.8 vs. 2.1 months; hazard ratio (HR)=0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.38-1.02; p=0.06] and median OS (7.5 vs. 4.7 months; HR=0.67, 95% CI=0.45-1.00; p=0.05). Multivariate analyses adjusted for age showed a significantly improved PFS (adjusted HR=0.60, 95% CI=0.36-0.98; p=0.04) and a suggestion of improved OS (adjusted HR=0.67, 95% CI=0.44-1.01, p=0.05) in the NP group as compared to non-NP group. Serious adverse events were seen in 13.3% of patients in the non-NP group and 17.1% patients in the NP group.In a single-institution retrospective cohort study, we report a significant improvement in the PFS and suggestion of improvement in the OS with NP-based second-line chemotherapy with an acceptable toxicity rate.

AB  - Members of the Society of Hospital Medicine were surveyed about geographic cohorting (GCh); 369 responses were analyzed, two thirds of which were from GCh participants. Improved collaboration with the bedside nurse, increased nonclinical interactions, decreased paging interruptions, and improved efficiency were perceived by &gt;50%. Narrowed clinical expertise, increased fragmentation, increased face-to-face interruptions, and an adverse impact on camaraderie within the hospitalist group were reported by 25% to 50%. Academic practices were associated with positive perceptions while higher patient loads were associated with negative perceptions. Comments on GCh benefits invoked improvements in (1) interprofessional collaboration, (2) efficiency, (3) patient-centeredness, (4) nursing satisfaction, and (5) GCh mediated facilitation of other interventions. GCh downsides included (1) professional and personal dissatisfaction, (2) concerns about providing suboptimal care, and (3) implementation barriers. GCh is receiving attention. Although it facilitates important benefits, it is perceived to mediate unintended consequences, which should be addressed in redesign efforts.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive cancer associated with high mortality worldwide. HCC develops in the setting of underlying cirrhosis due to chronic liver disease. Surgery is usually considered the treatment of choice for early disease; however, most patients have locally advanced or metastatic HCC at diagnosis in which case treatments are limited. Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) pathway offers a potential treatment strategy based on the encouraging results of the phase I/II trial of nivolumab (Checkmate 040 trial). This has led to the off-label use of nivolumab after failure of treatment with sorafenib either due to intolerance or progression of disease. Although rare (<5%), clinical response to anti-PD-1 antibody may be preceded by "pseudoprogression" -- increase in the size and number of tumor lesions before actual tumor shrinkage. We report a case of pseudoprogression followed by an excellent response in an HCC patient treated with nivolumab and review the literature for ongoing trials of immune checkpoint blockade in HCC. The pseudoprogression in our case is supported by increase in both tumor size and alpha-fetoprotein after four treatments with nivolumab; however, regression of tumor size and normalization of alpha-fetoprotein occurred after subsequent treatments. To our knowledge, there are no reports of pseudoprogression in HCC although pseudoprogression has been well described in melanoma.

AB  - Background Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most common hospital-acquired infections and can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality rates. Implementation of practice guidelines and recommended prevention bundles has historically been suboptimal, suggesting that improvements in implementation methods could further reductions in CLABSI rates. In this article, we describe the agile implementation methodology and present details of how it was successfully used to reduce CLABSI. Methods We conducted an observational study of patients with central line catheters at 2 adult tertiary care hospitals in Indianapolis from January 2015 to June 2017. Results The intervention successfully reduced the CLABSI rate from 1.76 infections per 1,000 central line days to 1.24 (rate ratio = 0.70; P = .011). We also observed reductions in the rates of Clostridium difficile and surgical site infections, whereas catheter-associated urinary tract infections remained stable. Conclusions Using the AI model, we were able to successfully implement evidence-based practices to reduce the rate of CLABSIs at our facility. Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most common hospital-acquired infections and can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality rates. Implementation of practice guidelines and recommended prevention bundles has historically been suboptimal, suggesting that improvements in implementation methods could further reductions in CLABSI rates. In this article, we describe the agile implementation methodology and present details of how it was successfully used to reduce CLABSI. We conducted an observational study of patients with central line catheters at 2 adult tertiary care hospitals in Indianapolis from January 2015 to June 2017. The intervention successfully reduced the CLABSI rate from 1.76 infections per 1,000 central line days to 1.24 (rate ratio = 0.70; P = .011). We also observed reductions in the rates of Clostridium difficile and surgical site infections, whereas catheter-associated urinary tract infections remained stable.

AB  - Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) have been associated with other chronic painful conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia, headache) and suicide and mood disorders. Here we examined musculoskeletal, painful, and mental health comorbidities in men vs women veterans with TMD (compared with non-TMD musculoskeletal disorders [MSDs] cases), as well as comorbidity patterns within TMD cases.Observational cohort.National Veterans Health Administration.A cohort of 4.1 million veterans having 1+ MSDs, entering the cohort between 2001 and 2011.Chi-square tests, t tests, and logistic regression were utilized for cross-sectional analysis.Among veterans with any MSD, those with TMD were younger and more likely to be women. The association of TMD with race/ethnicity differed by sex. Odds of TMD were higher in men of Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.27-1.48) and nonwhite race/ethnicity other than black or Hispanic (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.16-1.45) compared with white men. Odds of TMD were significantly lower for black (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.49-0.60) and Hispanic women (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.995) relative to white women. Non-MSD comorbidities (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, mental health, headaches) were significantly associated with TMD in male veterans; their pattern was similar in women. Veterans with back pain, nontraumatic joint disorder, or osteoarthritis had more MSD multimorbidity than those with TMD.Complex patterns of comorbidity in TMD cases may indicate different underlying mechanisms of association in subgroups or phenotypes, thereby suggesting multiple targets to improve TMD. Longitudinal comprehensive studies powered to look at sex and racial/ethnic groupings are needed to identify targets to personalize care.

AB  - The present study examined the degree to which loneliness mediated the influence of negative (social constraints) and positive (emotional support) relationship qualities on the global mental health of advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients and their family caregivers. Fifty patient-caregiver dyads completed measures assessing social constraints (e.g., avoidance, criticism) from the other dyad members, emotional support from others, loneliness, and global mental health. Structural equation modeling was used to examine individual models, and Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Modeling was used to examine dyadic associations. Individual path analyses for patients and caregivers demonstrated that emotional support had a significant indirect effect on mental health through loneliness (Bs = 0.32 and 0.30, respectively), but no associations were found between social constraints and mental health. In dyadic analyses, participants’ loneliness and mental health were not significantly related to their partner’s emotional support, loneliness, or mental health (Bs = − 0.18 to 0.18). Findings suggest that for advanced GI cancer patients and caregivers, emotional support from others alleviates feelings of loneliness, which may lead to better mental health. However, the benefits of emotional support appear to be primarily intrapersonal rather than interpersonal in nature. Additionally, participants endorsed low levels of social constraints, which might explain their lack of relation to loneliness and mental health. Continued examination of interdependence in social processes between cancer patients and caregivers will inform intervention development.

AB  - Patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are at high risk of subsequent vascular events. Hospitalization improves quality of care, yet admission rates for TIA patients vary considerably.We sought to identify factors associated with the decision to admit patents with TIA.We conducted a secondary analysis of a prior study's data including semi-structured interviews, administrative data, and chart review.We interviewed multidisciplinary clinical staff involved with TIA care. Administrative data included information for TIA patients in emergency departments or inpatient settings at VA medical centers (VAMCs) for fiscal years (FY) 2011 and 2014. Chart reviews were conducted on a subset of patients from 12 VAMCs in FY 2011.For the qualitative data, we focused on interviewees' responses to the prompt: "Tell me what influences you in the decision to or not to admit TIA patients." We used administrative data to identify admission rates and chart review data to identify ABCD2 scores (a tool to classify stroke risk after TIA).Providers' decisions to admit TIA patients were related to uncertainty in several domains: lack of a facility TIA-specific policy, inconsistent use of ABCD2 score, and concerns about facilities' ability to complete a timely workup. There was a disconnect between staff perceptions about TIA admission and facility admission rates. According to chart review data, staff at facilities with higher admission rates in FY 2011 reported consistent reliance on ABCD2 scores and related guidelines in admission decision-making.Many factors contributed to decisions regarding admitting a patient with TIA; however, clinicians' uncertainty appeared to be a key driver. Further quality improvement interventions for TIA care should focus on facility adoption of TIA protocols to address uncertainty in TIA admission decision-making and to standardize timely evaluation of TIA patients and delivery of secondary prevention strategies.

AB  - Background As a result of improvements in cancer screening, treatment, and supportive care, nearly two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) live for 5 years after diagnosis. An ever-increasing population of CRC survivors creates a need for effective survivorship care to help manage and mitigate the impact of CRC and its treatment. Personal health records (PHRs) and survivorship care plans provide a means of supporting the long-term care of cancer survivors. Objective The purpose of this study is to characterize the usefulness of a CRC PHR and survivorship care plan and to describe the usability of these technologies in a population of CRC survivors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess a PHR and survivorship care plan specifically targeting CRC survivors. Methods Twenty-two patients with CRC were recruited from surgery clinics of an academic medical center and Veterans Affairs hospital in Indianapolis and provided access to an online Colorectal Cancer Survivor’s Personal Health Record (CRCS-PHR). Survey data were collected to characterize the usefulness of the CRCS-PHR and describe its usability in a population of CRC survivors. CRC survivors were surveyed 6 months after being provided online access. Means and proportions were used to describe the usefulness and ease of using the CRC website. Open-ended questions were qualitatively coded using the constant comparative method. Results CRC survivors perceived features related to their health care (ie, summary of cancer treatment history, follow-up care schedule, description of side effects, and list of community resources) to be more useful than communication features (ie, creating online relationships with family members or caregivers, communicating with doctor, and secure messages). CRC survivors typically described utilizing traditional channels (eg, via telephone or in person) to communicate with their health care provider. Participants had overall positive perceptions with respect to ease of use and overall satisfaction. Major challenges experienced by participants included barriers to system log-in, lack of computer literacy or experience, and difficulty entering their patient information. Conclusions For CRC, survivors may find the greater value in a PHR’s medical content than the communication functions, which they have available elsewhere. These findings regarding the usefulness and usability of a PHR for the management of CRC survivorship provide valuable insights into how best to tailor these technologies to patients’ needs. These findings can inform future design and development of PHRs for purposes of both cancer and chronic disease management.

AB  - Abstract Objective We assess working relationships and collaborations within and between diabetes health care provider teams using social network analysis and a multi-scale community detection. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of claims data from a large employer over 2 years was performed. The study cohort contained 827 patients diagnosed with diabetes. The cohort received care from 2567 and 2541 health care providers in the first and second year, respectively. Social network analysis was used to identify networks of health care providers involved in the care of patients with diabetes. A multi-scale community detection was applied to the network to identify groups of health care providers more densely connected. Social network analysis metrics identified influential providers for the overall network and for each community of providers. Results Centrality measures identified medical laboratories and mail-order pharmacies as the central providers for the 2 years. Seventy-six percent of the detected communities included primary care physicians, and 97% of the communities included specialists. Pharmacists were detected as central providers in 24% of the communities. Discussion Social network analysis measures identified the central providers in the network of diabetes health care providers. These providers could be considered as influencers in the network that could enhance the implication of promotion programs through their access to a large number of patients and providers. Conclusion The proposed framework provides multi-scale metrics for assessing care team relationships. These metrics can be used by implementation experts to identify influential providers for care interventions and by health service researchers to determine impact of team relationships on patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective To develop and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a cognitive behavioral therapy–based, internet‐delivered self‐management program for chronic low back pain (cLBP) in veterans. Methods Phase I included program development, involving expert panel and participant feedback. Phase II was a single‐arm feasibility and preliminary efficacy study of the Pain e‐health for Activity, Skills, and Education (Pain EASE) program. Feasibility (ie, website use, treatment credibility, satisfaction) was measured using descriptive methods. Mixed models were used to assess mean within‐subject changes from baseline to 10 weeks post‐baseline in pain interference (primary outcome, West Haven‐Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory, scale of 0 to 6), pain intensity, mood, fatigue, sleep, and depression. Results Phase I participants ( n = 15) suggested modifications including style changes, content reduction, additional “Test Your Knowledge” quizzes, and cognitive behavioral therapy skill practice monitoring form revisions for enhanced usability. In Phase II, participants ( n = 58) were mostly male (93%) and White (60%), and had an average age of 55 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12) and moderate pain (mean score 5.9/10); 41 (71%) completed the post‐baseline assessment. Participants ( N = 58) logged on 6.1 (SD = 8.6) times over 10 weeks, and 85% reported being very or moderately satisfied with Pain EASE. Pain interference improved from a mean of 3.8 at baseline to 3.3 at 10 weeks (difference 0.5 [95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.9], P = 0.008). Within‐subject improvement also occurred for some secondary outcomes, including mood and depression symptoms. Discussion Veterans with cLBP may benefit from technology‐delivered interventions, which may also reduce pain interference. Overall, veterans found that Pain EASE, an internet‐based self‐management program, is feasible and satisfactory for cLBP.

AB  - Continuing education aims at assisting physicians to maintain competency and expose them to emerging issues in their field. Over the last decade, approaches to the delivery of educational content have changed dramatically as medical education at all levels is now benefitting from the use of web-based content and applications for mobile devices. The aim of the present study is to investigate through a randomized trial the effectiveness of a smart phone application to increase public health service physicians' (PHS physicians) knowledge regarding pediatric oral health care.Five of all seven DHCs (District Health Center) in Tehran, which were under the supervision of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iran University of Medical Sciences, were selected for our study. Physicians of one DHC had participated in a pilot study. All PHS physicians in the other four centers were invited to the current study on a voluntary basis (n = 107). They completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding their knowledge, attitudes, practice in pediatric dentistry, and background. PHS physicians were assigned randomly to intervention and control groups; those in the intervention group, received a newly designed evidence-based smartphone application, and those in the control group received a booklet, a CME seminar, and a pamphlet. A post-intervention survey was administered 4 months later and t-test and repeated measures ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) were performed to measure the difference in the PHS physicians' knowledge, attitude and practice.In both groups, the mean knowledge scores were significantly higher (p-Value < 0.001) in post-intervention data compared to those at baseline. Similar results existed in attitude and practice scores. Although the scores in knowledge in the intervention group indicating potentially greater improvement when compared to those of the control group, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (dif: 0.84, 95% CI - 0.35 to 2.02).In the light of the limitations of the present study, smart phone applications could improve knowledge, attitude and practice in physicians although this method was not superior to the conventional method of CME.Our clinical trial had been registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration code: IRCT2016091029765N1).

AB  - Increasingly, patients without clinical indications are undergoing genomic tests. The purpose of this study was to assess their appreciation and comprehension of their test results and their clinicians’ reactions. We conducted 675 surveys with participants from the Vanderbilt Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) cohort. We interviewed 36 participants: 19 had received positive results, and 17 were self-identified racial minorities. Eleven clinicians who had patients who had participated in eMERGE were interviewed. A further 21 of these clinicians completed surveys. Participants spontaneously admitted to understanding little or none of the information returned to them from the eMERGE study. However, they simultaneously said that they generally found testing to be “helpful,” even when it did not inform their health care. Primary care physicians expressed discomfort in being asked to interpret the results for their patients and described it as an undue burden. Providing genetic testing to otherwise healthy patients raises a number of ethical issues that warrant serious consideration. Although our participants were enthusiastic about enrolling and receiving their results, they express a limited understanding of what the results mean for their health care. This fact, coupled the clinicians’ concern, urges greater caution when educating and enrolling participants in clinically non-indicated testing.

AB  - Objectives The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project led to significant decreases in potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long-stay nursing facility residents in external evaluation. The purpose of this study was to quantify hospitalization risk from the start of the project and describe the heterogeneity of the enrolled facilities in order to better understand the context for successful implementation. Design Pre-post analysis design of a prospective intervention within a single group. Setting and Participants A total of 4320 residents in the 19 facilities were included from admission until time to the first hospitalization. Measures Data were extracted from Minimum Data Set assessments and linked with facility-level covariates from the LTCFocus.org data set. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess risk of hospitalization during the preintervention period (2011-2012), a “ramp-up” period (2013-2014), and an intervention period (2015-2016). Results The cohort consisted of 4230 long-stay nursing facility residents. Compared with the preintervention period, residents during the intervention period had an increased probability of having no hospitalizations within 1 year, increasing from 0.51 to 0.57, which was statistically significant (P < .001). In adjusted Cox models, the risk of hospitalization was lower in the ramp-up period compared to the pre-period [hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.95] and decreased further during the intervention period (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.84). Conclusions and Implications As part of a large multisite demonstration project, OPTIMISTIC has successfully reduced hospitalizations. However, this study highlights the magnitude and extent to which results differ across facilities. Implementing the OPTIMISTIC program was associated with a 16% risk reduction after the first 18 months and continued to a final risk reduction of 26% after 5½ years. Although this model of care reduces hospitalizations overall, facility variation should be expected.

AB  - ABCDEF bundle implementation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is associated with dose dependent improvements in patient outcomes. The objective was to compare nurse attitudes about the ABCDEF bundle to self-reported adherence to bundle components.Cross-sectional study.Nurses providing direct patient care in 28 ICUs within 18 hospitals across the United States.53-item survey of attitudes and practice of the ABCDEF bundle components was administered between November 2011 and August 2015 (n = 1661).We did not find clinically significant correlations between nurse attitudes and adherence to Awakening trials, Breathing trials, and sedation protocol adherence (rs = 0.05-0.28) or sedation plan discussion during rounds and Awakening and Breathing trial Coordination (rs = 0.19). Delirium is more likely to be discussed during rounds when ICU physicians and nurse managers facilitate delirium reduction (rs = 0.27-0.36). Early mobilization is more likely to occur when ICU physicians, nurse managers, staffing, equipment, and the ICU environment facilitate early mobility (rs = 0.36-0.47). Physician leadership had the strongest correlation with reporting an ICU environment that facilitates ABCDEF bundle implementation (rs = 0.63-0.74).Nurse attitudes about bundle implementation did not predict bundle adherence. Nurse manager and physician leadership played a large role in creating a supportive ICU environment.

AB  - Background Critical care patients with delirium are at an increased risk of functional decline and mortality long term. Objective To determine the relationship between delirium severity in the intensive care unit and mortality and acute health care utilization within 2 years after hospital discharge. Methods A secondary data analysis of the Pharmacological Management of Delirium and Deprescribe randomized controlled trials. Patients were assessed twice daily for delirium or coma using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Delirium severity was measured using the CAM-ICU-7. Mean delirium severity (from time of randomization to discharge) was categorized as rapidly resolving, mild to moderate, or severe. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model time to death, first emergency department visit, and rehospitalization. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, discharge location, diagnosis, and intensive care unit type. Results Of 434 patients, those with severe delirium had higher mortality risk than those with rapidly resolving delirium (hazard ratio 2.21; 95% CI, 1.35-3.61). Those with 5 or more days of delirium or coma had higher mortality risk than those with less than 5 days (hazard ratio 1.52; 95% CI, 1.07-2.17). Delirium severity and number of days of delirium or coma were not associated with time to emergency department visits and rehospitalizations. Conclusion Increased delirium severity and days of delirium or coma are associated with higher mortality risk 2 years after discharge.

AB  - Goals of care conversations are important but complex for clinicians caring for older adults. Although clinicians tend to focus on specific medical interventions, these conversations are more successful if they begin with gaining a shared understanding of the medical conditions and possible outcomes, followed by discussion of values and goals. Although training in the medical setting is incomplete, there are many published and online resources that can help clinicians gain these valuable skills.

AB  - Abstract Background Questions persist about how learning healthcare systems should integrate audit and feedback (A&amp;F) into quality improvement (QI) projects to support clinical teams’ use of performance data to improve care quality. Objective To identify how a virtual “Hub” dashboard that provided performance data for patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA), a resource library, and a forum for sharing QI plans and tools supported QI activities among newly formed multidisciplinary clinical teams at six Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Design An observational, qualitative evaluation of how team members used a web-based Hub. Participants External facilitators and multidisciplinary team members at VA facilities engaged in QI to improve the quality of TIA care. Approach Qualitative implementation process and summative evaluation of observational Hub data (interviews with Hub users, structured field notes) to identify emergent, contextual themes and patterns of Hub usage. Key Results The Hub supported newly formed multidisciplinary teams in implementing QI plans in three main ways: as an information interface for integrated monitoring of TIA performance; as a repository used by local teams and facility champions; and as a tool for team activation. The Hub enabled access to data that were previously inaccessible and unavailable and integrated that data with benchmark and scientific evidence to serve as a common data infrastructure. Led by champions, each implementation team used the Hub differently: local adoption of the staff and patient education materials; benchmarking facility performance against national rates and peer facilities; and positive reinforcement for QI plan development and monitoring. External facilitators used the Hub to help teams leverage data to target areas of improvement and disseminate local adaptations to promote resource sharing across teams. Conclusions As a dynamic platform for A&amp;F operating within learning health systems, hubs represent a promising strategy to support local implementation of QI programs by newly formed, multidisciplinary teams.

AB  - Background and objective A recent study identified progranulin as a candidate biomarker for frailty, based on gene expression databases. In the present study, we investigated associations between serum progranulin levels and frailty in a population-based sample of late middle-age and older adults. Methods We utilized a cohort study that included 358 African Americans (baseline ages 49–65). Frailty was assessed by three established methods: the interview-based FRAIL scale, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty scale that includes performance-based measurements, and the Frailty Index (FI) that is based on cumulative deficits. Serum levels of the following proteins and metabolites were measured: progranulin, cystatin C, fructosamine, soluble cytokine receptors (interleukin-2 and -6, tumor necrosis factor α-1 and -2), and C-reactive protein. Sarcopenia was assessed using the SARC-F index. Vital status was determined by matching through the National Death Index (NDI). Results Serum progranulin levels were associated with frailty for all indices (FRAIL, CHS, and FI) but not with sarcopenia. Inflammatory markers indicated by soluble cytokine receptors (sIL-2R, sIL-6R, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were positively associated serum progranulin. Increased serum progranulin levels at baseline predicted poorer outcomes including future frailty as measured by the FRAIL scale and 15-year all-cause mortality independent of age, gender, and frailty. Conclusions Our findings suggest that serum progranulin levels may be a candidate biomarker for physical frailty, independent of sarcopenia. Further studies are needed to validate this association and assess the utility of serum progranulin levels as a potential biomarker for prevalent frailty, for risk for developing incident frailty, and for mortality risk over and above the effect of baseline frailty.

AB  - Aims Whether risk of worsening renal function (WRF) during acute heart failure (AHF) hospitalization or the association between in‐hospital WRF and post‐discharge outcomes vary according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is uncertain. We assessed incidence of WRF, factors related to its development and impact of WRF on post‐discharge outcomes across the spectrum of LVEF in patients enrolled in RELAX‐AHF‐2. Methods and results A total of 6112 patients who had LVEF measured on admission and renal function determined prospectively during hospitalization were included. WRF, defined as a rise in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline through day 5, occurred in 1722 patients (28.2%). Incidence increased progressively from lowest to highest LVEF quartile ( P &lt; 0.001). After baseline adjustment, WRF risk in Q4 (LVEF &gt;50%) remained significantly greater than in Q1 (LVEF ≤29%; hazard ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1–1.43; P = 0.050). Age and comorbidity burden including chronic kidney disease increased as LVEF increased. Neither admission haemodynamic abnormalities, extent of diuresis during hospitalization nor residual congestion explained the increased incidence of WRF in patients with higher LVEF. Serelaxin treatment and diuretic responsiveness were associated with reduced risk of WRF in all LVEF quartiles. WRF in patients in the upper three LVEF quartiles increased risk of post‐discharge events. Conclusions Worsening renal function incidence during AHF hospitalization increases progressively with LVEF. Greater susceptibility of patients with higher LVEF to WRF appears more related to their advanced age and worse underlying kidney function rather than haemodynamic or treatment effects. WRF is associated with increased risk of post‐discharge events except in patients in the lowest LVEF quartile.

AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has improved symptom and quality-of-life outcomes in pilot research with post-treatment cancer survivors. To further test the ACT model, the present study examined relationships between ACT constructs and subgroups of post-treatment survivors based on the severity of common symptoms. Survivors who had completed primary treatment for stage I or II cancer (N = 203) participated in this one-time survey. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of survivors based on the severity of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial logistic regressions employing Vermunt’s 3-step approach were used to examine ACT constructs (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance, values progress) as correlates of survivor subgroups based on symptoms. The LCA showed three survivor classes: (1) mild-to-moderate levels of all symptoms except for normal pain intensity; (2) mild anxiety, moderate fatigue, and normal levels of all other symptoms; and (3) normal levels of all symptoms. Lower mindfulness, acceptance, and values progress and higher cognitive fusion, psychological inflexibility, and values obstruction were associated with a greater likelihood of being in class 1 or 2 than in class 3. Findings are consistent with the ACT model. Survivors with greater symptom burden reported greater withdrawal from personally meaningful activities and less acceptance of their cancer diagnosis and internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, symptoms). Findings provide strong justification for further testing of ACT to reduce symptom-related suffering in cancer survivors.

AB  - Background Esophagectomy is associated with postoperative delirium, but its pathophysiology is not well defined. We conducted this study to measure the relationship among serum biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal injury and delirium incidence and severity in a cohort of esophagectomy patients. Methods Blood samples were obtained from patients preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 3 and were analyzed for S100 calcium-binding protein B, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 8 and IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit. Delirium severity was assessed once daily with the Delirium Rating Scale–Revised-98. Results Samples from 71 patients were included. Preoperative biomarker concentrations were not associated with postoperative delirium. Significant differences in change in concentrations from preoperatively to postoperative day 1 were seen in IL-8 (delirium, 38.6; interquartile range [IQR], 29.3-69.8; no delirium, 24.8; IQR, 16.0-41.7, P = .022), and IL-10 (delirium, 26.1; IQR, 13.9-36.7; no delirium, 12.4; IQR, 7.7-25.7; P = .025). Greater postoperative increase in S100 calcium-binding protein B (Spearman r = 0.289, P = .020) and lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 were correlated with greater delirium severity (Spearman r = −0.27, P = .040). Greater CRP change quartiles were associated with higher delirium incidence adjusting for severity of illness (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.75; P = .037) or comorbidities (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.76, P = .030). Conclusions Differences in change in serum CRP, IL-8, and IL-10 concentrations were associated with postoperative delirium, suggesting biomarker measurement early in the postoperative course is associated with delirium.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined relations between acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) constructs and symptom‐based subgroups of advanced cancer patients. Methods Patients with advanced breast, gastrointestinal, lung, and prostate cancer ( N = 201) completed questionnaires assessing five common symptoms and ACT variables (i.e., psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, values obstruction and progress, peaceful acceptance, mindfulness, and activity engagement) on one occasion. Results Latent profile analysis showed three patient classes: (1) normal levels of all symptoms (32%); (2) normal levels of all symptoms except for mild sleep problems and moderate fatigue (19%); and (3) normal pain, mild levels of sleep problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and moderate fatigue (48%). Controlling for demographic covariates, lower psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, and values obstruction were associated with a higher likelihood of being in classes 1 or 2 than class 3. In addition, greater values progress, peaceful acceptance, mindfulness, and activity engagement were associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 1 than class 3. Of these four factors, only greater mindfulness and activity engagement were associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 2 than class 3. Conclusions Advanced cancer patients show heterogeneous symptom profiles, and even mild to moderate symptom levels are related to greater withdrawal from personally meaningful activities and less acceptance of cancer and internal experiences (e.g., symptoms, thoughts, feelings). Findings are consistent with the ACT model and support further testing of ACT to address symptom interference with functioning in advanced cancer patients.

AB  - Delirium prevention requires optimal management of pain and anxiety. Given the limitations of current pharmacologic interventions, evaluation of novel non-pharmacological interventions is required. Virtual reality (VR) stimulation may be a promising intervention because of its capability to reduce psychophysiological stress, pain, and anxiety and to restore cognitive and attentional capacities.To ascertain patients' and providers' perceptions of acceptability and safety of VR intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU).We enrolled a cohort of 15 ICU patients and 21 health care providers to administer a 15-minute session showing a relaxing beach scene with VR headsets and nature sound effects. Participants were then asked to rate their experiences on a Likert scale survey.The majority of patients (86%, 12 of 14) rated the headsets as moderately to very comfortable. All had moderate or greater sense of presence in the virtual environment, and 79% (11 of 14) rated their overall experience at 3 or greater (5 indicating that they enjoyed it very much). Seventy-one percent (10 of 14) of the patients felt that their anxiety was better with VR, and 57% (8 of 14) did not notice a change in their pain or discomfort. All health care providers found the headset to be at least moderately comfortable and felt a moderate or greater sense of presence. All providers concluded that VR therapy should be available for their patients. Both groups experienced minimal side effects.In this prospective study of perceptions of VR therapy for ICU patients and health care providers, there was a high level of acceptance, with minimal side effects, for both groups despite their low levels of prior experience with virtual reality and video gaming.

AB  - The complexity of genomic medicine can be streamlined by implementing some form of clinical decision support (CDS) to guide clinicians in how to use and interpret personalized data; however, it is not yet clear which strategies are best suited for this purpose. In this study, we used implementation science to identify common strategies for applying provider-based CDS interventions across six genomic medicine clinical research projects funded by an NIH consortium. Each project's strategies were elicited via a structured survey derived from a typology of implementation strategies, the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), and follow-up interviews guided by both implementation strategy reporting criteria and a planning framework, RE-AIM, to obtain more detail about implementation strategies and desired outcomes. We found that, on average, the three pharmacogenomics implementation projects used more strategies than the disease-focused projects. Overall, projects had four implementation strategies in common; however, operationalization of each differed in accordance with each study's implementation outcomes. These four common strategies may be important for precision medicine program implementation, and pharmacogenomics may require more integration into clinical care. Understanding how and why these strategies were successfully employed could be useful for others implementing genomic or precision medicine programs in different contexts.

AB  - Researchers need approaches for analyzing complex phenomena when assessing contingency relationships where specific conditions explain an outcome only when combined with other conditions. Using a mixed methods design, we paired configurational methods and qualitative thematic analysis to model contingency in veteran community reintegration outcomes, identifying combinations of conditions that led to success or lack of success in community reintegration among US military veterans. This pairing allowed for modeling contingency at a detailed level beyond the capabilities of either approach alone. Our analysis revealed multiple contingent relationships at work in explaining reintegration, including social support, purpose, cultural adjustment, and military separation experiences. This study contributes to the field of mixed methods by pairing a mathematical cross-case method with a qualitative method to model contingency.

AB  - We propose DEGAS (Diagnostic Evidence GAuge of Single cells), a novel deep transfer learning framework, to transfer disease information from patients to cells. We call such transferrable information "impressions," which allow individual cells to be associated with disease attributes like diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. Using simulated data and ten diverse single-cell and patient bulk tissue transcriptomic datasets from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple myeloma (MM), we demonstrate the feasibility, flexibility, and broad applications of the DEGAS framework. DEGAS analysis on myeloma single-cell transcriptomics identified PHF19high myeloma cells associated with progression. Availability: https://github.com/tsteelejohnson91/DEGAS .

AB  - Counterfeit medicines are a healthcare security problem, posing not only a direct threat to patient safety and public health but also causing heavy economic losses. Current anticounterfeiting methods are limited due to the toxicity of the constituent materials and the focus of secondary packaging level protections. We introduce an edible, imperceptible, and scalable matrix code of information representation and data storage for pharmaceutical products. This matrix code is digestible as it is composed of silk fibroin genetically encoded with fluorescent proteins produced by ecofriendly, sustainable silkworm farming. Three distinct fluorescence emission colors are incorporated into a multidimensional parameter space with a variable encoding capacity in a format of matrix arrays. This code is smartphone-readable to extract a digitized security key augmented by a deep neural network for overcoming fabrication imperfections and a cryptographic hash function for enhanced security. The biocompatibility, photostability, thermal stability, long-term reliability, and low bit error ratio of the code support the immediate feasibility for dosage-level anticounterfeit measures and authentication features. The edible code affixed to each medicine can serve as serialization, track and trace, and authentication at the dosage level, empowering every patient to play a role in combating illicit pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Interpreting results from deprescribing interventions to generate actionable evidence is challenging owing to inconsistent and heterogeneous outcome definitions between studies. We sought to characterize deprescribing intervention outcomes and recommend approaches to measure outcomes for future studies. A scoping literature review focused on deprescribing interventions for polypharmacy and informed a series of expert panel discussions and recommendations. Twelve experts in deprescribing research, policy, and clinical practice interventions participating in the Measures Workgroup of the US Deprescribing Research Network sought to characterize deprescribing outcomes and recommend approaches to measure outcomes for future studies. The scoping review identified 125 papers reflecting 107 deprescribing studies. Common outcomes included medication discontinuation, medication appropriateness, and a broad range of clinical outcomes potentially resulting from medication reduction. Panel recommendations included clearly defining clinically meaningful medication outcomes (e.g., number of chronic medications, dose reductions), ensuring adequate sample size and follow-up time to capture clinical outcomes resulting from medication discontinuation (e.g., quality of life [QOL]), and selecting appropriate and feasible data sources. A new conceptual model illustrates how downstream clinical outcomes (e.g., reduction in falls) should be interpreted in the context of initial changes in medication measures (e.g., reduction in mean total medications). Areas needing further development include implementation outcomes specific to deprescribing interventions and measures of adverse drug withdrawal events. Generating evidence to guide deprescribing is essential to address patient, caregiver, and clinician concerns about the benefits and harms of medication discontinuation. This article provides recommendations and an initial conceptual framework for selecting and applying appropriate intervention outcomes to support deprescribing research.

We analyzed three open question categories (general, biomedical, and psychosocial) used by 27 Taiwanese medical students from two SP interviews, conducted before and after training.Across the full encounter, use of general and psychosocial open questions increased significantly after training (from 27 to 92 general questions and 15 to 33 psychosocial questions). The high rates of narrowly focused opening questions (52% of initial position questions, 74% of second position questions, and 85% of third position questions) prior to training were reduced to 11%, 15%, and 15% respectively after training. Students also shifted from a micro (narrow) to a macro (broad) pattern of questioning.The 'bottom-up' approach facilitated by using conversation transcripts is effective in improving communication skills.By carefully reviewing transcripts of their own performance as part of an overall communication training package, beginning medical students can become more patient-centered in soliciting patient problems.

AB  - Using the principles of clinical epidemiology, public health officials were able to organize society to prevent the transmission of disease and premature death well before the basic science mechanisms of such interventions were understood. 1 Paneth N.

Epidemiology. 2004; 15: 514-516 Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar Using the same principles, the association between aging, disease, disability, and social structures has been recognized for at least a century. 2 Callahan C.M.

Oxford University Press, New York2004 Google Scholar Community-based surveys in the 1950s identified a litany of medical, psychological, and social ailments common among older adults. Since that time, dozens of longitudinal cohort studies in multiple countries have reported similar findings: (1) most older adults live independently at home and most of their needs are provided through informal care systems; (2) these older adults suffer from unmet social and medical needs; and (3) the lack of social, economic, recreational, and educational opportunities contribute to disability. 2 Callahan C.M. Berrrios G.E. Reinventing depression: a history of the treatment of depression in primary care, 1940–2004. Oxford University Press, New York2004 Google Scholar These studies also revealed that conditions once thought to be inevitable concomitants of normal aging were, in fact, preventable or could be properly managed so as to prevent excess disability. A cohort study of older adults in 2013 would reach similar conclusions. What continues to change, however, is this boundary between normal aging and disease and, thus, the range of potential targets for medical or social intervention.

AB  - Oral diseases are a major burden on individuals and health systems. The aim of this study was to determine whether consumption of tobacco and alcohol were associated with the prevalence of oral/dental problems in Mexican adults. Using data from the National Performance Evaluation Survey 2003, a cross-sectional study part of the World Health Survey, dental information from a representative sample of Mexico (n = 22,229, N = 51,155,740) was used to document self-reported oral/dental problems in the 12 months prior to the survey. Questionnaires were used to collect information related to sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and other risk factors. Three models were generated for each age group (18-30, 31-45 and 46-98 years). The prevalence of oral/dental conditions was 25.7%. Adjusting for sex, schooling, socioeconomic position, diabetes, and self-reported health, those who used tobacco (sometimes or daily) (OR = 1.15, p = 0.070; OR = 1.24, p < 0.01; and OR = 1.16, p < 0.05, for each age group respectively) or alcohol (moderate or high) (OR = 1.26, p < 0.001; OR = 1.18, p < 0.01 and OR = 1.30, p < 0.001, for each age group respectively) had a higher risk of reporting oral/dental problems. Because tobacco and alcohol use were associated with self-reported oral/dental problems in one out of four adults, it appears advisable to ascertain how direct is such link; more direct effects would lend greater weight to adopting measures to reduce consumption of tobacco and alcohol for the specific purpose of improving oral health.

AB  - Cognitive impairment (CI) is one of several factors known to influence hospitalization, hospital length of stay, and rehospitalization among older adults. Redesigning care delivery systems sensitive to the influence of CI may reduce acute care utilization while improving care quality. To develop a foundation of fundamental needs for health care redesign, we conducted focus groups with inpatient and outpatient providers to identify barriers, facilitators, and suggestions for improvements in care delivery for patients with CI.Focus group sessions were conducted with providers to identify their approach to caring for cognitively impaired hospitalized adults; obstacles and facilitators to providing this care; and suggestions for improving the care process. Using a thematic analysis, two reviewers analyzed these transcripts to develop codes and themes.Seven themes emerged from the focus group transcripts. These were: (1) reflections on serving the cognitively impaired population; (2) descriptions of perceived barriers to care; (3) strategies that improve or facilitate caring for hospitalized older adults; (4) the importance of fostering a hospital friendly to the needs of older adults; (5) the need for educating staff, patients, and caregivers; (6) the central role of good communication; and (7) steps needed to provide more effective care.Providing effective acute care services to older adults with CI is an important challenge in health care reform. An understanding derived from the perspective of multiple professional disciplines is an important first step. Future research will build on this preliminary study in developing new acute care models for patients with CI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: High levels of homocysteine have been associated with increased risk for dementia although results have been inconsistent. There are no reported studies from the developing world including Africa. Methods: In this longitudinal study of two community-dwelling cohorts of elderly Yoruba and African Americans, levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folate were measured from blood samples taken in 2001. These levels were compared in two groups, participants who developed incident dementia in the follow-up until 2009 (59 Yoruba and 101 African Americans) and participants who were diagnosed as cognitively normal or in the good performance category at their last follow-up (760 Yoruba and 811 African Americans). Homocysteine levels were divided into quartiles for each site. Results: After adjusting for age, education, possession of ApoE, smoking, and time of enrollment the higher quartiles of homocysteine were associated with a non-significant increase in dementia risk in the Yoruba (homocysteine quartile 4 vs. 1 OR: 2.19, 95% CI 0.95–5.07, p = 0.066). For the African Americans, there was a similar but non-significant relationship between higher homocysteine levels and dementia risk. There were no significant relationships between levels of vitamin B12 and folate and incident dementia in either site although folate levels were lower and vitamin B12 levers were higher in the Yoruba than in the African Americans. Conclusions: Increased homocysteine levels were associated with a similar but non-significant increase in dementia risk for both Yoruba and African Americans despite significant differences in folate levels between the two sites.

AB  - Over half of the veterans returning from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are burdened with chronic pain. Although these young veterans may have to live with pain for the rest of their lives, little is known about the struggles this new group of veterans faces, or their perceptions of support from family, friends, and others. The purpose of this study is to understand Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans' experiences with chronic pain and social support.In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with veterans who participated in an intervention for chronic pain. Grounded theory guided data analysis.Veterans described a range of emotions associated with chronic pain, including hopelessness, anger, and fear that their pain would worsen. For some, talking about their pain was helpful, but others avoided talking about their pain, often because people did not understand or overreacted.Although support from friends and family is often effective, veterans and others with chronic pain are uniquely positioned to offer support to others with pain. Clinically, an approach to pain management in which veteran peers are integrated into chronic pain treatment approaches, similar to the Veterans Affairs' mental health model of care, might offer additional benefits for veterans with chronic pain.

AB  - To examine effects of pre-enrollment opioid use on outcomes of a 12-month collaborative pain care management trial. We hypothesized that participants with opioid use would have worse pain at baseline; use more health care services and analgesics; and have worse pain outcomes during the trial.Secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data.Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care.Patients age 18-65 years with chronic pain of at least moderate severity who were enrolled in a 12-month pragmatic trial of a telephone-based collaborative care intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain.Participants were categorized as opioid users (n = 84) or non-users (n = 166) at baseline and trial randomization was stratified by opioid use. We used logistic regression to examine cross-sectional associations with baseline opioid use and mixed-effect models for repeated measures to examine baseline opioid use as a predictor of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scores over 12 months.At baseline, 33.6% reported use of prescribed opioids. Baseline opioid users had higher baseline BPI scores and higher health-related disability than non-users. Baseline opioid users also had more outpatient visits (15.0 vs. 10.1; p = 0.001) and received more analgesics (p < 0.001) during the trial. In the final multivariable model examining effects of baseline opioid use on BPI over 12 months, opioid users and nonusers had a non-significant difference of 0.25 points (p = 0.098). In conclusion, although baseline opioid users had worse pain at baseline and used more health care during the study, response to the intervention was not significantly modified by pre-existing opioid therapy.

AB  - Background: There are insufficient data on pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) pharmacokinetics (PK), particularly for children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We conducted a prospective nevirapine (NVP) PK study among HIV-infected Kenyan children aged 3–13 years initiating an NVP-based ART regimen. NVP dose timing was measured through medication event monitors. Participants underwent 2 inpatient assessments: 1 at 4–8 weeks after ART initiation and 1 at 3–4 months after ART initiation. Allometric scaling of oral clearance (CL)/bioavailability (F) and volume of distribution (Vd)/F values were computed. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction method was performed with covariates. The impact of adherence on time below minimum effective concentration was assessed in the final PK model using medication event monitors data and model-estimated individual parameters. Results: Among 21 children enrolled, mean age was 5.4 years and 57% were female. CL/F was 1.67 L/h and Vd/F was 3.8 L for a median child weighing 15 kg. Participants' age had a significant impact on CL/F (P < 0.05), with an estimated decrease in CL of 6.2% for each 1-year increase in age. Total body water percentage was significantly associated with Vd/F (P < 0.001). No children had >10% of time below minimum effective concentration when the PK model assumed perfect adherence compared with 10 children when adherence data were used. Conclusions: Age and body composition were significantly associated with children's NVP PK parameters. ART adherence significantly impacted drug exposure over time, revealing subtherapeutic windows that may lead to viral resistance.

AB  - Background: Most Alzheimer disease clinical trials that compare the use of health services rely on reports of caregivers. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of self-reports among older adults with Alzheimer disease and their caregiver proxy respondents. This issue is particularly relevant to Alzheimer disease clinical trials because inaccuracy can lead both to loss of power and increased bias in study outcomes. Methods: We compared respondent accuracy in reporting any use and in reporting the frequency of use with actual utilization data as documented in a comprehensive database. We next simulated the impact of underreporting and overreporting on sample size estimates and treatment effect bias for clinical trials comparing utilization between experimental groups. Results: Respondents self-reports have a poor level of accuracy with κ-values often below 0.5. Respondents tend to underreport use even for rare events such as hospitalizations and nursing home stays. In analyses simulating underreporting and overreporting of varying magnitude, we found that errors in self-reports can increase the required sample size by 15% to 30%. In addition, bias in the reported treatment effect ranged from 3% to 18% due to both underreporting and overreporting errors. Conclusions: Use of self-report data in clinical trials of Alzheimer disease treatments may inflate sample size needs. Even when adequate power is achieved by increasing sample size, reporting errors can result in a biased estimate of the true effect size of the intervention.

AB  - Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can support vaccine forecasting and immunization reminders; however, immunization decision-making requires data from fragmented, independent systems. Interoperability and accurate data exchange between immunization information systems (IIS) is an essential factor to utilize Immunization CDS systems. Service oriented architecture (SOA) and Health Level 7 (HL7) are dominant standards for web-based exchange of clinical information. We implemented a system based on SOA and HL7 v3 to support immunization CDS in Iran. We evaluated system performance by exchanging 1500 immunization records for roughly 400 infants between two IISs. System turnaround time is less than a minute for synchronous operation calls and the retrieved immunization history of infants were always identical in different systems. CDS generated reports were accordant to immunization guidelines and the calculations for next visit times were accurate. Interoperability is rare or nonexistent between IIS. Since inter-state data exchange is rare in United States, this approach could be a good prototype to achieve interoperability of immunization information.

AB  - Introduction Persistent musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent, disabling, and often undertreated condition. This paper examines the acceptability of a telecare intervention for this condition. Methods The Stepped Care to Optimize Pain Care Effectiveness (SCOPE) intervention couples automatic symptom monitoring (ASM) with optimized analgesic care management by a nurse-physician team. Data from participants in the telecare intervention arm (n = 124) of a randomized control trial of SCOPE were analysed to determine the acceptability of the telecare intervention as indicated by patient use and satisfaction. Results Most (93.5%) patients completed at least one ASM report, selecting equally web-based (49%) or interactive voice-recorded (51%) reporting. The median number of ASM reports and nurse contacts per patient was 15 and 12, respectively. Of 12 demographic and clinical factors examined, none predicted the number of ASM reports, whereas nurse contacts were more frequent in patients with higher pain severity or receiving opioids. Only a minority of ASM reports required an expedited nurse call, with the most frequent alerts being for a medication change, a nurse call or side effects. Most (92%) patients rated ASM as easy to use and found the ASM reporting (76%) and nurse contacts (81%) very or moderately helpful. Nearly three-fourths of patients rated their overall pain treatment as good to excellent. The most common suggestions from patient feedback were for a free-text messaging function, more frequent nurse contact and less redundancy in ASM reporting items. Discussion Participants generally found the telecare intervention a user-friendly and helpful approach for treating persistent musculoskeletal pain.

AB  - Abstract Background Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common comorbidity in HF and affects patients’ outcome. We sought to assess the effects of serelaxin in patients with and without AFib. Methods In a post hoc analysis of the RELAX-AHF trial, we compared the effects of serelaxin on efficacy end points, safety end points and biomarkers in 1161 patients with and without AFib on admission electrocardiogram. Results AFib was present in 41.3% of patients. Serelaxin had a similar effect in patients with and without AFib, including dyspnea relief by visual analog scale through day 5 [mean change in area under the curve, 541.11 (33.79, 1048.44), p = 0.0366 in AFib versus 361.80 (−63.30, 786.90), p = 0.0953 in non-AFib, interaction p = 0.5954] and all-cause death through day 180 [HR = 0.42 (0.23, 0.77), p = 0.0051 in AFib versus 0.90 (0.53, 1.52), p = 0.6888 in non-AFib, interaction p = 0.0643]. Serelaxin was similarly safe in the two groups and induced similar reductions in biomarkers of cardiac, renal and hepatic damage. Stroke occurred more frequently in AFib patients (2.8 vs. 0.8%, p = 0.0116) and there was a trend for lower stroke incidence in the serelaxin arm in AFib patients (odds ratios, 0.31, p = 0.0759 versus 3.88, p = 0.2255 in non-AFib, interaction p = 0.0518). Conclusions Serelaxin was similarly safe and efficacious in improving short- and long-term outcomes and inducing organ protection in acute HF patients with and without AFib.

AB  - BACKGROUND Annual computed tomography (CT) scans are a component of the current standard of care for the posttreatment surveillance of survivors of colorectal cancer (CRC) after curative‐intent resection. The authors conducted a retrospective study with the primary aim of assessing patient, physician, and organizational characteristics associated with the receipt of CT surveillance among veterans. METHODS The Department of Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry was used to identify patients diagnosed with AJCC collaborative stage I to III CRC between 2001 and 2009. Patient sociodemographic and clinical (ie, CRC stage and comorbidity) characteristics, provider specialty, and organizational characteristics were measured. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between patient, provider, and organizational characteristics on receipt of 1) consistently guideline‐concordant care (at least 1 CT every 12 months for both of the first 2 years of CRC surveillance) versus no CT receipt and 2) potential overuse (&gt;1 CT every 12 months during the first 2 years of CRC surveillance) of CRC surveillance using CT. The authors also analyzed the impact of the 2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology update in CRC surveillance guidelines on care received over time. RESULTS For 2263 survivors of stage II/III CRC who were diagnosed after 2005, 19.4% of patients received no surveillance CT, whereas potential overuse occurred in both surveillance years for 14.9% of patients. Guideline‐concordant care was associated with younger age, higher stage of disease (stage III vs stage II), and geographic region. In adjusted analyses, younger age and higher stage of disease (stage III vs stage II) were found to be associated with overuse. There was no significant difference in the annual rate of CT scanning noted across time periods (year ≤ 2005 vs year &gt; 2005). CONCLUSIONS Among a minority of veteran survivors of CRC, both underuse and potential overuse of CT surveillance were present. Patient factors, but no provider or organizational characteristics, were found to be significantly associated with patterns of care. The 2005 change in American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines did not appear to have an impact on rates of surveillance CT. Cancer 2017;123:2338–2351. © 2017 American Cancer Society .

AB  - The recent advances in photocatalysis have opened a variety of new possibilities for energy and biomedical applications. In particular, plasmonic photocatalysis using hybridization of semiconductor materials and metal nanoparticles has recently facilitated the rapid progress in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency under visible or solar light. One critical underlying aspect of photocatalysis is that it generates and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) as intermediate or final products upon light excitation or activation. Although plasmonic photocatalysis overcomes the limitation of UV irradiation, synthesized metal/semiconductor nanomaterial photocatalysts often bring up biohazardous and environmental issues. In this respect, this review article is centered in identifying natural photosensitizing organic materials that can generate similar types of ROS as those of plasmonic photocatalysis. In particular, we propose the idea of plasmonic photocatalyst-like fluorescent proteins for ROS generation under visible light irradiation. We recapitulate fluorescent proteins that have Type I and Type II photosensitization properties in a comparable manner to plasmonic photocatalysis. Plasmonic photocatalysis and protein photosensitization have not yet been compared systemically in terms of ROS photogeneration under visible light, although the phototoxicity and cytotoxicity of some fluorescent proteins are well recognized. A comprehensive understanding of plasmonic photocatalyst-like fluorescent proteins and their potential advantages will lead us to explore new environmental, biomedical, and defense applications.

AB  - Web-based patient portals feature secure messaging systems that enable health care providers and patients to communicate information. However, little is known about the usability of these systems for clinical document sharing.This article evaluates the usability of a secure messaging system for providers and patients in terms of its ability to support sharing of electronic clinical documents.We conducted usability testing with providers and patients in a human-computer interaction laboratory at a Midwestern U.S. hospital. Providers sent a medication list document to a fictitious patient via secure messaging. Separately, patients retrieved the clinical document from a secure message and returned it to a fictitious provider. We collected use errors, task completion, task time, and satisfaction.Twenty-nine individuals participated: 19 providers (6 physicians, 6 registered nurses, and 7 pharmacists) and 10 patients. Among providers, 11 (58%) attached and sent the clinical document via secure messaging without requiring assistance, in a median (range) of 4.5 (1.8-12.7) minutes. No patients completed tasks without moderator assistance. Patients accessed the secure messaging system within 3.6 (1.2-15.0) minutes; retrieved the clinical document within 0.8 (0.5-5.7) minutes; and sent the attached clinical document in 6.3 (1.5-18.1) minutes. Although median satisfaction ratings were high, with 5.8 for providers and 6.0 for patients (scale, 0-7), we identified 36 different use errors. Physicians and pharmacists requested additional features to support care coordination via health information technology, while nurses requested features to support efficiency for their tasks.This study examined the usability of clinical document sharing, a key feature of many secure messaging systems. Our results highlight similarities and differences between provider and patient end-user groups, which can inform secure messaging design to improve learnability and efficiency. The observations suggest recommendations for improving the technical aspects of secure messaging for clinical document sharing.

AB  - <h3>Background:</h3> Hazardous alcohol use with depression may exacerbate health conditions and complicate medical care. We examined the rate of depression screening by alcohol use severity among primary care patients screened for hazardous alcohol use and, among those screened, examined patterns of significant depressive symptoms. <h3>Methods:</h3> Using cross-sectional data from primary care patients (n = 2,894,906), we examined past-90-day alcohol use (number of typical drinking days/week and typical number of drinks consumed daily); depression screening rates (using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]); and symptom severity, demographics, and prevalence of selected psychiatric diagnoses. <h3>Results:</h3> Within 30 days of routine, in-clinic alcohol use screening by medical assistants, 2.4% (n = 68,686) of patients also completed a PHQ-9; these patients were more likely to be female, younger, white, Medicaid insured, and to have a nondepressive psychiatric diagnosis and a lower Charlson comorbidity score. Abstainers and moderate drinkers (1 to 7 drinks/week or 1 to 4 drinks/week for women and individuals &gt;65 years or for men ≤65 years, respectively) were less likely than hazardous drinkers (exceeding weekly limits) to complete the PHQ-9 or to have significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥10). Nonwhite patients with higher Charlson comorbidity scores were more likely to endorse significant depressive symptoms. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Only a small fraction of patients in this cohort were screened for depression. Nonwhite patients and those with higher comorbidity burden were more likely to report depression but less likely to be screened. These discrepancies between depression-screening rates and significant depressive symptoms suggest that screening for depression should be enhanced in these at-risk groups.

AB  - Pediatric pain is associated to patient weight and demographics in specialized settings, but pain prevalence and its associated patient attributes in general pediatric outpatient care are unknown. Our objective was to determine the rate of positive pain screenings in pediatric primary care and evaluate the relationship between reported pain and obesity, demographics, and exam findings during routine pediatric encounters. Cross-sectional observational study of 26,180 patients ages 2 to 19 seen in five urban pediatric primary care clinics between 2009 and 2016. Data were collected from systematic screening using a computerized clinical decision support system. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between pain reporting and obesity (body mass index), age, sex, race, season, insurance status, clinic site, prior pain reporting, pain reporting method, and exam findings. Pain was reported by the patient or caregiver in 14.9% of visits. In adjusted models, pain reporting was associated with obesity (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.11–1.35) and severe obesity (OR 1.32, CI 1.17–1.49); adolescents (OR 1.47, CI 1.33–1.61); and females (OR 1.21, CI 1.12–1.29). Pain reported at the preceding visit increased odds of pain reporting 2.67 times (CI 2.42–2.95). Abnormal abdominal, extremity, ear, nose, throat, and lymph node exams were associated with pain reporting. Pain reporting increased in minority races within clinics that predominantly saw a concordant race. Pain is common in general pediatric encounters, and occurs more frequently in obese children and those who previously reported pain. Pain reporting may be influenced by seasonal variation and clinic factors. Future pediatric pain screening may be guided by associated risk factors to improve identification and targeted healthcare interventions.

AB  - Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a critical component of HIV prevention. VMMC policies have achieved initial targets in adult men yet continue to fall short in reaching younger men and adolescents. We present the cost and scale-up implications of an education-based, VMMC intervention for adolescent street-connected males, for whom the street has become their home and/or source of livelihood. The intervention was piloted as part of the Engaging Street Youth in HIV Interventions Project in Eldoret, Kenya. We used a micro-costing approach to estimate the average cost of a VMMC intervention in 116 street-connected youth. Average cost was estimated per individual and per cohort by dividing total cost per intervention by number of clients accessing the intervention over a 30-day period. Total average costs included direct and support procedure costs, educational costs, and direct research costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in cost per DALYs averted over a 5 and 10-year period. The total cost of the intervention was $12,526 over the 30-day period, with an average cost per individual of $108. The direct VMMC procedure cost was approximately $9 per individual. Personnel costs contributed the greatest percentage to the total intervention cost (38.2%), with mentors and social workers representing the highest wage earners. Retreat-related and education costs contributed 51% and 13% respectively to the total average cost, with surgical equipment costs contributing less than 1%. At a cost of $108 per individual, the intervention averted 60166 DALYs in 5 years resulting in a cost per DALY averted of $267. The VMMC intervention was highly cost-effective in Kenya, despite the additional costs incurred to reach SCY. Further scale-up may be warranted to effectively apply this intervention in comparable populations.

AB  - Our objective is to examine the relationship of patient and provider characteristics and communication with chronic non-cancer pain and opioid management in primary care.We conducted an observational study using audio-recorded primary care appointments (up to 3/patient) and self-reported assessments of primary care providers (PCPs) and patients. We coded visit transcripts for 1) opioid and pain management talk and 2) mental health and opioid safety talk.Eight PCPs and 30 patients had complete data for 78 clinic visits. PCPs and patients engaged in more opioid and pain management talk when patients reported greater pain catastrophizing and PCPs reported higher psychosocial orientation. PCPs and patients engaged in talk about mental health and opioid safety when patients reported greater anxiety, higher working alliance with their PCP, and when PCPs reported higher burnout. PCPs' negative attitudes about opioids were associated with fewer discussions about mental health and opioid safety.Our results should facilitate design of interventions that improve communication and, ultimately, pain outcomes for patients.Clinicians can use our results to increase patient engagement in discussions about opioid use and pain management or mental health and safety discussions.

AB  - Abstract The widespread adoption and use of electronic health records and their use to enable learning health systems (LHS) holds great promise to accelerate both evidence-generating medicine (EGM) and evidence-based medicine (EBM), thereby enabling a LHS. In 2016, AMIA convened its 10th annual Policy Invitational to discuss issues key to facilitating the EGM-EBM paradigm at points-of-care (nodes), across organizations (networks), and to ensure viability of this model at scale (sustainability). In this article, we synthesize discussions from the conference and supplements those deliberations with relevant context to inform ongoing policy development. Specifically, we explore and suggest public policies needed to facilitate EGM-EBM activities on a national scale, particularly those policies that can enable and improve clinical and health services research at the point-of-care, accelerate biomedical discovery, and facilitate translation of findings to improve the health of individuals and populations.

AB  - This study sought to identify and describe the cognitive requirements and associated information needs of referring primary care providers (PCPs) during the referral process as well as characterize referring PCPs’ experiences with current health information technology. We interviewed 62 referring PCPs. Our four-member analysis team used hierarchical task analysis to construct a goal-directed hierarchy. We utilized extensions of the task analysis to describe PCPs’ common experiences with health information technologies throughout the referral process. The resultant goal hierarchy includes one main goal (Referral for Additional Care), two sub-goals (Assess Patient’s Condition and Manage Referrals), and four major tasks with respective decisions (What consultation is warranted; What information should I provide; What additional action is needed; and How to integrate specialists’ findings). Approximately 22 information needs were commonly identified and PCPs described their use of various sources - other PCPs, electronic health records, chat software, and paper- to satisfy those information needs. Cognitive demand for referring PCPs is high throughout the referral process. They have to search, identify, compose, track, and integrate information across multiple screens, systems, and people. Existing interfaces do not adequately support the communication, information exchange, or care coordination related to the referral process. Results from this study provide an important foundation for developing patient-centered displays that support PCPs’ decision-making process and reduce cognitive challenges.

AB  - Abstract Background Although attending to spiritual and religious needs is part of high quality care of pediatric cancer patients, oncology clinicians may not understand the role of the chaplain, resulting in underutilization of resources and failure to fully integrate the chaplain into the clinical team. We provide a description of what the chaplain does in the care of pediatric oncology patients. Methods We conducted a qualitative content analysis of chaplain chart notes over a one‐year period on the pediatric oncology service at a freestanding children's hospital. Using criteria designed to capture multiple potential factors in chaplain referral, we selected 30 patients for thematic analysis. Results In 2016, 166 pediatric patients were diagnosed with cancer and received ongoing care at our institution. From the 30 patients selected, 230 chaplain encounters were documented in the medical chart. Three major themes emerged. (1) The chaplains provided a rich description of spiritual and psychosocial aspects of the patient and family's experience; (2) chaplains provided diverse interventions, both religious and secular in nature; and (3) chaplains provided care within a longitudinal relationship. All three themes depend on the empathic listening by a chaplain. Conclusions The chaplains’ observations about patient and family beliefs, experiences, and emotional/spiritual states have the potential to inform the interdisciplinary care of the patient. Chaplain documentation provides insight into how spiritual care interventions and close relationships may promote patient and family well‐being. In future work, we will explore how to give voice to their insights in caring for pediatric oncology patients.

AB  - As many as 70% of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors suffer from long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). We describe how the first ICU survivor clinic in the United States, the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC), was designed to address PICS using the principles of Agile Implementation (AI).The CCRC was designed using an eight-step process known as the AI Science Playbook. Patients who required mechanical ventilation or were delirious ≥48 hours during their ICU stay were enrolled in the CCRC. One hundred twenty subjects who completed baseline HABC-M CG assessments and had demographics collected were included in the analysis to identify baseline characteristics that correlated with higher HABC-M CG scores. A subset of patients and caregivers also participated in focus group interviews to describe their perceptions of PICS.Quantitative analyses showed that the cognitive impairment was a major concern of caregivers. Focus group data also confirmed that caregivers of ICU survivors (n = 8) were more likely to perceive cognitive and mental health symptoms than ICU survivors (n = 10). Caregivers also described a need for ongoing psychoeducation about PICS, particularly cognitive and mental health symptoms, and for ongoing support from other caregivers with similar experiences.Our study demonstrated how the AI Science Playbook was used to build the first ICU survivor clinic in the United States. Caregivers of ICU survivors continue to struggle with PICS, particularly cognitive impairment, months to years after discharge. Future studies will need to examine whether the CCRC model of care can be adapted to other complex patient populations seen by health-care professionals.

AB  - Objective Delirium is associated with poor outcomes among critically ill patients. However, it is not well characterized among patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (IS and HS). We provide the population-level frequency of in-hospital delirium and assess its association with in-hospital outcomes and with 30-day readmission among IS and HS patients. Methods We analyzed Nationwide in-hospital and readmission data for years 2010–2015 and identified stroke patients using ICD-9 codes. Delirium was identified using validated algorithms. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay, unfavorable discharge disposition, and 30-day readmission. We used survey design logistic regression methods to provide national estimates of proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for delirium, and odds ratios (OR) for association between delirium and poor outcomes. Results We identified 3,107,437 stroke discharges of whom 7.45% were coded to have delirium. This proportion significantly increased between 2010 (6.3%) and 2015 (8.7%) (aOR, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.03–1.05). Delirium proportion was higher among HS patients (ICH: 10.0%, SAH: 9.8%) as compared to IS patients (7.0%). Delirious stroke patients had higher in-hospital mortality (12.3% vs. 7.8%), longer in-hospital stay (11.6 days vs. 7.3 days) and a significantly greater adjusted risk of 30-day-readmission (16.7%) as compared to those without delirium (12.2%) (aRR, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.11–1.15). Upon readmission, patients with delirium at initial admission continued to have a longer length of stay (7.7 days vs. 6.6 days) and a higher in-hospital mortality (9.3% vs. 6.4%). Conclusion Delirium identified through claims data in stroke patients is independently associated with poor in-hospital outcomes both at index admission and readmission. Identification and management of delirium among stroke patients provides an opportunity to improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare pain and psychological outcomes in veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pain alone and to determine if veterans with comorbidity respond differently to a stepped-care intervention than those with pain alone. Design Secondary analysis of data from the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial. Setting Six Veterans Health Affairs clinics. Subjects Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (N = 222) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods Longitudinal analysis of veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain and PTSD or pain alone and available baseline and nine-month trial data. Participants randomized to either usual care or a stepped-care intervention were analyzed. The pain–PTSD comorbidity group screened positive for PTSD and had a PTSD Checklist–Civilian score ≥41 at baseline. Results T tests demonstrated statistically significant differences and worse outcomes on pain severity, pain cognitions, and psychological outcomes in veterans with comorbid pain and PTSD compared with those with pain alone. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) modeling change scores from baseline to nine months indicated no statistically significant differences, controlling for PTSD, on pain severity, pain centrality, or pain self-efficacy. Significant differences emerged for pain catastrophizing (t = 3.10, P &amp;lt; 0.01), depression (t = 3.39, P &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (t = 3.80, P &amp;lt; 0.001). The interaction between PTSD and the stepped-care intervention was not significant. Conclusions Veterans with the pain–PTSD comorbidity demonstrated worse pain and psychological outcomes than those with chronic pain alone. These findings indicate a more intense chronic pain experience for veterans when PTSD co-occurs with pain. PTSD did not lead to a differential response to a stepped-care intervention.

AB  - Healthcare analytics is impeded by a lack of machine learning (ML) model generalizability, the ability of a model to predict accurately on varied data sources not included in the model's training dataset. We leveraged free-text laboratory data from a Health Information Exchange network to evaluate ML generalization using Notifiable Condition Detection (NCD) for public health surveillance as a use case. We 1) built ML models for detecting syphilis, salmonella, and histoplasmosis; 2) evaluated generalizability of these models across data from holdout lab systems, and; 3) explored factors that influence weak model generalizability. Models for predicting each disease reported considerable accuracy. However, they demonstrated poor generalizability across data from holdout lab systems being tested. Our evaluation determined that weak generalization was influenced by variant syntactic nature of free-text datasets across each lab system. Results highlight the need for actionable methodology to generalize ML solutions for healthcare analytics.

AB  - Abstract Maternal and infant health (MIH) mobile applications (apps) are increasingly popular and frequently used for health education and decision making. Interventions grounded in theory-based behavior change techniques (BCTs) are shown to be effective in promoting healthy behavior changes. MIH apps have the potential to be useful tools, yet the extent to which they incorporate BCTs is still unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of BCTs in popular MIH apps available in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Twenty-nine popular MIH apps were coded for the presence of 16 BCTs using the mHealth app taxonomy. Popular MIH apps whose purpose was to provide health education or decision-making support to pregnant women or parents/caregivers of infants were included in the final sample. On an average, the reviewed apps included seven BCTs (range 2–16). Techniques such as personalization, review of general or specific goals, macro tailoring, self-monitoring of goals, and health behavior linkages were most frequently present. No differences in the presence of BCTs between paid and free apps were observed. Popular MIH apps typically included only a minority of BCTs found to be useful for health promotion. However, apps developed by healthcare developers incorporated a higher number of BCTs within the app content. Therefore, app developers and policymakers may consider strategies to increase health expert involvement in app design and content delivery.

AB  - To characterize the risk of long-term cognitive impairment associated with delirium in acute neurologic injury patients.We analyzed a 10-year cohort of adult acute neurologic injury patients (stroke and traumatic brain injury) without preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia, utilizing administrative databases. Patients were followed for in-hospital delirium and mild cognitive impairment or dementia. We report incidence and adjusted hazard ratios for mild cognitive impairment or dementia associated with delirium. Subgroups analyzed include acute neurologic injury categories, dementia subtypes, repeated delirium exposure, and age strata.We used state emergency department and state inpatient databases for New York, Florida, and California. All visits are included in the databases regardless of payer status.We included adult patients with diagnosis of stroke and traumatic brain injury as acute neurologic injury. Patients with preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia were excluded.None.Among 911,380 acute neurologic injury patients, 5.2% were diagnosed with delirium. Mild cognitive impairment or dementia incidence among delirium patients was approximately twice that of nondelirium patients. In adjusted models, risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was higher among patients with delirium (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58). Increased risk was observed across all subgroups including patients less than or equal to 55 years old.Identification, management, and prevention of in-hospital delirium could potentially improve long-term cognitive outcomes in acute neurologic injury patients.

AB  - Abstract Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) resolves heterogenous cell populations in tissues and helps to reveal single-cell level function and dynamics. In neuroscience, the rarity of brain tissue is the bottleneck for such study. Evidence shows that, mouse and human share similar cell type gene markers. We hypothesized that the scRNA-seq data of mouse brain tissue can be used to complete human data to infer cell type composition in human samples. Here, we supplement cell type information of human scRNA-seq data, with mouse. The resulted data were used to infer the spatial cellular composition of 3702 human brain samples from Allen Human Brain Atlas. We then mapped the cell types back to corresponding brain regions. Most cell types were localized to the correct regions. We also compare the mapping results to those derived from neuronal nuclei locations. They were consistent after accounting for changes in neural connectivity between regions. Furthermore, we applied this approach on Alzheimer’s brain data and successfully captured cell pattern changes in AD brains. We believe this integrative approach can solve the sample rarity issue in the neuroscience.

AB  - <h3>Importance</h3> Simple measures of hypertension treatment, such as achievement of blood pressure (BP) targets, ignore the intensity of treatment once the BP target is met. High-intensity treatment involves increased treatment burden and can be associated with potential adverse effects in older adults. A method was previously developed to identify older patients receiving intense hypertension treatment by low BP and number of BP medications using national Veterans Health Administration and Medicare Part D administrative pharmacy data to evaluate which BP medications a patient is likely taking on any given day. <h3>Objective</h3> To further develop and validate a method to more precisely quantify dose intensity of hypertension treatment using only health system administrative pharmacy fill data. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Observational, cross-sectional study of 319 randomly selected older veterans in the national Veterans Health Administration health care system who were taking multiple BP-lowering medications and had a total of 3625 ambulatory care visits from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2013. Measure development and medical record review occurred January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, and data analysis was conducted from December 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> For each BP-lowering medication, a moderate hypertension daily dose (HDD) was defined as half the maximum dose above which no further clinical benefit has been demonstrated by that medication in hypertension trials. Patients’ total HDD was calculated using pharmacy data (pharmacy HDDs), accounting for substantial delays in refills (&gt;30 days) when a patient’s pill supply was stretched (eg, cutting existing pills in half). As an external comparison, the pharmacy HDDs were correlated with doses manually extracted from clinicians’ visit notes (clinically noted HDDs). How well the pharmacy HDDs correlated with clinically noted HDDs was calculated (using C statistics). To facilitate interpretation, HDDs were described in association with the number of medications. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 316 patients (99.1%) were male; the mean (SD) age was 75.6 (7.2) years. Pharmacy HDDs were highly correlated (<i>r</i> = 0.92) with clinically noted HDDs, with a mean (SD) of 2.7 (1.8) for pharmacy HDDs and 2.8 (1.8) for clinically noted HDDs. Pharmacy HDDs correlated with high-intensity, clinically noted HDDs ranging from a C statistic of 92.8% (95% CI, 92.0%-93.7%) for 2 or more clinically noted HDDs to 88.1% (95% CI, 85.5%-90.6%) for 6 or more clinically noted HDDs. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study suggests that health system pharmacy data may be used to accurately quantify hypertension regimen dose intensity. Together with clinic-measured BP, this tool can be used in future health system–based research or quality improvement efforts to fine-tune, manage, and optimize hypertension treatment in older adults.

AB  - Little research has documented the experiences of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their caregivers in navigating health systems for TBI care. In this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 62 participants (34 patients with moderate or severe TBI and 28 caregivers) from Central Indiana. Data were collected from January to September 2016 and analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Participants discussed three significant challenges about navigating health services for TBI care: lack of support for care navigation, financial barriers, and communication barriers. Participants described how navigating outpatient healthcare services for TBI remains complex and emphasised the need for ongoing care navigation support throughout the care continuum. They detailed the long-term financial burden of TBI including high treatment costs, limited insurance coverage, and the emotional toll that financial stress has on their ability to navigate healthcare services for ongoing TBI-related needs. They also discussed how ineffective patient-provider communication and lack of reliable, timely and comprehensive health information about TBI limited their engagement in and navigation of TBI health services. Findings suggest that persons with TBI and their caregivers need ongoing support to manage the long-term impacts of TBI. Efforts to provide care coordination and navigation to patients with TBI and their families are urgently needed to facilitate greater access to care, effective healthcare navigation and improved health outcomes.

AB  - To assess the practice- and market-level factors associated with the amount of provider health information exchange (HIE) use.Provider and practice-level data was drawn from the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Public Use Files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Physician Compare National Downloadable File, and the Compendium of US Health Systems, among other sources. We analyzed the relationship between provider HIE use and practice and market factors using multivariable linear regression and compared primary care providers (PCPs) to non-PCPs. Provider volume of HIE use is measured as the percentage of referrals sent with electronic summaries of care (eSCR) reported by eligible providers attesting to the Meaningful Use electronic health record (EHR) incentive program in 2016.Providers used HIE in 49% of referrals; PCPs used HIE in fewer referrals (43%) than non-PCPs (57%). Provider use of products from EHR vendors was negatively related to HIE use, while use of Athenahealth and Greenway Health products were positively related to HIE use. Providers treating, on average, older patients and greater proportions of patients with diabetes used HIE for more referrals. Health system membership, market concentration, and state HIE consent policy were unrelated to provider HIE use.HIE use during referrals is low among office-based providers with the capability for exchange, especially PCPs. Practice-level factors were more commonly associated with greater levels of HIE use than market-level factors.This furthers the understanding that market forces, like competition, may be related to HIE adoption decisions but are less important for use once adoption has occurred.

AB  - The reasons for discordance between advance care planning (ACP) documentation and current preferences are not well understood. The POLST form offers a unique opportunity to learn about the reasons for discordance and concordance that has relevance for POLST as well as ACP generally.Qualitative descriptive including constant comparative analysis within and across cases.Twenty-six nursing facilities in Indiana.Residents (n = 36) and surrogate decision-makers of residents without decisional capacity (n = 37).A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore the reasons for discordance or concordance between current preferences and existing POLST forms.Reasons for discordance include: (1) problematic nursing facility practices related to POLST completion; (2) missing key information about POLST treatment decisions; (3) deferring to others; and (4) changes over time. Some participants were unable to explain the discordance due to a lack of insight or inability to remember details of the original POLST conversation. Explanations for concordance include: (1) no change in the resident's medical condition and/or the resident is unlikely to improve; (2) use of the substituted judgment standard for surrogate decision-making; and (3) fixed opinion about what is "right" with little to no insight.Participant explanations for discordance between existing POLST orders and current preferences highlight the importance of adequate structures and processes to support high quality ACP in nursing facilities. Residents with stable or poor health may be more appropriate candidates for POLST than residents with a less clear prognosis, though preferences should be revisited periodically as well as when there is a change in condition to help ensure existing documentation is concordant with current treatment preferences.

AB  - POLST is widely used to document the treatment preferences of nursing facility residents as orders, but it is unknown how well previously completed POLST orders reflect current preferences (concordance) and what factors are associated with concordance.To describe POLST preference concordance and identify factors associated with concordance.Chart reviews to document existing POLST orders and interviews to elicit current treatment preferences.POLST-using nursing facilities (n = 29) in Indiana.Nursing facility residents (n = 123) and surrogates of residents without decisional capacity (n = 152).Concordance was determined by comparing existing POLST orders for resuscitation, medical interventions, and artificial nutrition with current treatment preferences. Comfort-focused POLSTs contained orders for do not resuscitate, comfort measures, and no artificial nutrition.Overall, 55.7% (123/221) of residents and 44.7% (152/340) of surrogates participated (total n = 275). POLST concordance was 44%, but concordance was higher for comfort-focused POLSTs (68%) than for non-comfort-focused POLSTs (27%) (p < 0.001). In the unadjusted analysis, increasing resident age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p < 0.01), better cognitive functioning (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13, p < 0.01), surrogate as the decision-maker (OR 2.87, OR 1.73-4.75, p < 0.001), and comfort-focused POLSTs (OR 6.01, 95% CI 3.29-11.00, p < 0.01) were associated with concordance. In the adjusted multivariable model, only having an existing comfort-focused POLST was associated with higher odds of POLST concordance (OR 5.28, 95% CI 2.59-10.73, p < 0.01).Less than half of all POLST forms were concordant with current preferences, but POLST was over five times as likely to be concordant when orders reflected preferences for comfort-focused care. Findings suggest a clear need to improve the quality of POLST use in nursing facilities and focus its use among residents with stable, comfort-focused preferences.

AB  - Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) is a scientific and practical human-centered discipline that studies and improves human performance in sociotechnical systems. HFE in pharmacy promotes the human-centered design of systems to support individuals and teams performing medication-related work.To review select HFE methods well suited to address pharmacy challenges, with examples of their application in pharmacy.We define the scope of HFE methods in pharmacy as applications to pharmacy settings, such as inpatient or community pharmacies, as well as medication-related phenomena such as medication safety, adherence, or deprescribing. We identify and present seven categories of HFE methods suited to widespread use for pharmacy research and clinical practice.Categories of HFE methods applicable to pharmacy include work system analysis; task analysis; workload assessment; medication safety and error analysis; user-centered and participatory design; usability evaluation; and physical ergonomics. HFE methods are used in three broad phases of human-centered design and evaluation: study; design; and evaluation. The most robust applications of HFE methods involve the combination of HFE methods across all three phases. Two cases illustrate such a comprehensive application of HFE: one case of medication package, label, and information design and a second case of human-centered design of a digital decision aid for medication safety.Pharmacy, including the places where pharmacy professionals work and the multistep process of medication use across people and settings, can benefit from HFE. This is because pharmacy is a human-centered sociotechnical system with an existing tradition of studying and analyzing the present state, designing solutions to problems, and evaluating those solutions in laboratory or practice settings. We conclude by addressing common concerns about the implementation of HFE methods and urge the adoption of HFE methods in pharmacy.

AB  - To assess primary care teams' perceptions of a health information exchange (HIE) event notification intervention for geriatric patients in 2 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers.We conducted a qualitative evaluation of an event notification alerting primary care teams to non-VHA hospital admissions and emergency department visits. Data were collected through semistructured interviews (n = 23) of primary care team physicians, nurses and medical assistants. Study design and analysis were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).Team members found the alerts necessary, helpful for filling information gaps, and effective in supporting timely follow-up care, although some expressed concern over scheduling capacity and distinguishing alerts from other VHA notices. Participants also suggested improvements including additional data on patients' diagnosis and discharge instructions, timing alerts to patients' discharge (including clear next steps), including additional team members to ensure alerts were acted upon, and implementing a single sign-on.Primary care team members perceived timely event notification of non-VHA emergency department visits and hospital admissions as potentially improving post-discharge follow-up and patient outcomes. However, they were sometimes unsure of next steps and suggested the alerts and platform could be streamlined for easier use.Event notifications may be a valuable tool in coordinating care for high-risk older patients. Future intervention research should explore the optimal amount and types of information and delivery method across sites and test the integration of alerts into broader care coordination efforts.

AB  - To determine the diagnostic operating characteristics of The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) depression scales in screening for major depression.Interview data from patients enrolled in clinical trials involving patients with chronic pain (2 trials) or post-stroke (1 trial) were analyzed. This included baseline and follow-up interviews in 648 and 586 study patients, respectively. Patients completed PROMIS depression scales of varying lengths (4-item, 6-item, and two 8-item scale versions) as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) depression scale. A Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) was administered to establish diagnoses of major depression and any depression. Sensitivity and specificity at various score cutpoints as well as area under the curve (AUC) were calculated.PROMIS scales of varying lengths had similar diagnostic operating characteristics. The optimal screening cutpoint for PROMIS raw scores on the 4-, 6-, and 8-item scales was 8, 12, and 16, respectively, which corresponds to a PROMIS T-score of 55. The average sensitivity and specificity of the two PROMIS 8-item scales for major depression across the 3 trials using a T-score cutpoint ≥55 was 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. This was almost identical to 0.81 and 0.82 for the PHQ-9 at its standard cutpoint score ≥ 10. The average AUC for major depression was identical (0.91) for the two PROMIS 8-item scales and PHQ-9, and also similar for any depression (0.87 to 0.89).PROMIS scales ranging from 4 to 8 items have strong operating characteristics comparable to the PHQ-9 in screening for depression.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01236521, NCT01583985, NCT01507688.

AB  - Smart infusion pumps affect workflows as they add alerts and alarms in an information-rich clinical environment where alarm fatigue is already a major concern. An analytic approach is needed to quantify the impact of these alerts and alarms on nursing workflows and patient safety.To analyze a detailed infusion dataset from a smart infusion pump system and identify contributing factors for infusion programming alerts, operational alarms, and alarm resolution times.We analyzed detailed infusion pump data across four hospitals in a health system for up to 1 year. The prevalence of alerts and alarms was grouped by infusion type and a selected list of 32 high-alert medications (HAMs). Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between a set of risk factors and the occurrence of alerts and alarms. We used nonparametric tests to explore the relationship between alarm resolution times and a subset of predictor variables.The study dataset included 745,641 unique infusions with a total of 3,231,300 infusion events. Overall, 28.7% of all unique infusions had at least one operational alarm, and 2.1% of all unique infusions had at least one programming alert. Alarms averaged two per infusion, whereas at least one alert happened in every 48 unique infusions. Eight percent of alarms took over 4 minutes to resolve. Intravenous fluid infusions had the highest rate of error-state occurrence. HAMs had 1.64 more odds for alerts than the rest of the infusions. On average, HAMs had a higher alert rate than maintenance fluids.Infusion pump alerts and alarms impact clinical care, as alerts and alarms by design interrupt clinical workflow. Our study showcases how hospital system leadership teams can leverage infusion pump informatics to prioritize quality improvement and patient safety initiatives pertaining to infusion practices.

AB  - Epithelial and stromal tissues are components of the tumor microenvironment and play a major role in tumor initiation and progression. Distinguishing stroma from epithelial tissues is critically important for spatial characterization of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we propose BrcaSeg, an image analysis pipeline based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify epithelial and stromal regions in whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathological images. The CNN model is trained using well-annotated breast cancer tissue microarrays and validated with images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program. BrcaSeg achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Using this model, we generate pixel-level epithelial/stromal tissue maps for 1000 TCGA breast cancer slide images that are paired with gene expression data. We subsequently estimate the epithelial and stromal ratios and perform correlation analysis to model the relationship between gene expression and tissue ratios. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of genes that are highly correlated with tissue ratios suggest that the same tissue is associated with similar biological processes in different breast cancer subtypes, whereas each subtype also has its own idiosyncratic biological processes governing the development of these tissues. Taken all together, our approach can lead to new insights in exploring relationships between image-based phenotypes and their underlying genomic events and biological processes for all types of solid tumors.

AB  - Background Methods to visualise patient safety data can support effective monitoring of safety events and discovery of trends. While quality dashboards are common, use and impact of dashboards to visualise patient safety event data remains poorly understood. Objectives To understand development, use and direct or indirect impacts of patient safety dashboards. Methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL for publications between 1 January 1950 and 30 August 2018 involving use of dashboards to display data related to safety targets defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Patient Safety Net. Two reviewers independently reviewed search results for inclusion in analysis and resolved disagreements by consensus. We collected data on development, use and impact via standardised data collection forms and analysed data using descriptive statistics. Results Literature search identified 4624 results which were narrowed to 33 publications after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and consensus across reviewers. Publications included only time series and case study designs and were inpatient focused and emergency department focused. Information on direct impact of dashboards was limited, and only four studies included informatics or human factors principles in development or postimplementation evaluation. Discussion Use of patient-safety dashboards has grown over the past 15 years, but impact remains poorly understood. Dashboard design processes rarely use informatics or human factors principles to ensure that the available content and navigation assists task completion, communication or decision making. Conclusion Design and usability evaluation of patient safety dashboards should incorporate informatics and human factors principles. Future assessments should also rigorously explore their potential to support patient safety monitoring including direct or indirect impact on patient safety.

AB  - Abstract Background Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or nicotine consumption is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. Methods Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n = 8214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in either April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and nicotine and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco or nicotine with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. Results Compared to people with self-identified “excellent” or very good health status, those reporting “good” or “fair” health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. Conclusions In a statewide, community-based population drawn for SARS-CoV-2 testing, we find that overall health status was associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. More research is needed to further understand the nature of this relationship.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) represent a significant cause of injury in the ambulatory care setting. Computerized physician order entry reduces rates of serious medication errors that can lead to ADEs in the inpatient setting, but few studies have evaluated whether computerized prescribing in the ambulatory setting reduces preventable ADE rates in ambulatory care.To determine the rates of preventable ADEs before and after the implementation of computerized prescribing with basic clinical decision support for ordering medications.Before-after study of ADE rates in practices implementing computer order entry.Adult patients seeking care in primary care practices at academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts (n = 41,819), and Indianapolis, Indiana (n = 9128).We attempted to standardize the medication-related decision support knowledge base provided at the 2 sites, although the electronic records and presentation layers used at the 2 sites differed. The primary outcome was preventable ADEs identified based on structured results or symptoms defined by extracting symptom concepts from provider notes; potential ADEs were a secondary outcome.Computerized prescribing did not significantly change the rate of preventable ADEs at either site. Compared with Boston practices, the rate of potential ADEs was more than seven-fold greater at Indianapolis (6.4/10,000 patient-months vs. 49.5/10,000 patient-months, P < 0.001). Computerized prescribing was associated with a 56% decrease in the potential ADE rate at Indianapolis (49.5 to 21.9/10,000 patient-months, P < 0.001) but a 104% increase at Boston (6.4 to 13.0/10,000 patient-months, P < 0.001). Preventable ADEs that occurred after computerized prescribing was implemented were due to patient education issues, physicians ignoring feedback from CDSS, and incomplete computerized knowledge base was incomplete (34%, 33%, and 33% in Indianapolis and 44%, 28%, and 28% in Boston).The implementation of computerized prescribing in the ambulatory setting was not associated with any change in preventable ADEs but was associated with a decrease in potential ADEs at Indianapolis but an increase at Boston, although the absolute rate of ADEs was much lower in Boston.

AB  - What is already known about this topic? Studies suggest that immunocompromised persons who receive COVID-19 vaccination might not develop high neutralizing antibody titers or be as protected against severe COVID-19 outcomes as are immunocompetent persons. What is added by this report? The effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitalization was lower (77%) among immunocompromised adults than among immunocompetent adults (90%). Vaccine effectiveness varied considerably among immunocompromised patient subgroups. What are the implications for public health practice? Immunocompromised persons benefit from COVID-19 mRNA vaccination but are less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes than are immunocompetent persons. Immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should receive three doses and a booster, consistent with CDC recommendations, practice nonpharmaceutical interventions, and, if infected, be monitored closely and considered early for proven therapies that can prevent severe outcomes. Immunocompromised persons, defined as those with suppressed humoral or cellular immunity resulting from health conditions or medications, account for approximately 3% of the US adult population.1 Immunocompromised adults are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes2 and might not acquire the same level of protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as do immunocompetent adults.3, 4 To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) among immunocompromised adults, data from the VISION Network1 on hospitalizations among persons aged ≥18 years with COVID-19–like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states during January 17–September 5, 2021 were analyzed. Using selected discharge diagnoses,2 VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization conferred by completing a two-dose series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine ≥14 days before the index hospitalization date3 (i.e., being fully vaccinated) was evaluated using a test-negative design comparing 20,101 immunocompromised adults (10,564 [53%] of whom were fully vaccinated) and 69,116 immunocompetent adults (29,456 [43%] of whom were fully vaccinated). VE of two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was lower among immunocompromised patients (77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%–80%) than among immunocompetent patients (90%; 95% CI = 89%–91%). This difference persisted irrespective of mRNA vaccine product, age group, and timing of hospitalization relative to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance in the state of hospitalization. VE varied across immunocompromising condition subgroups, ranging from 59% (organ or stem cell transplant recipients) to 81% (persons with a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder). Immunocompromised persons benefit from mRNA COVID-19 vaccination but are less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes than are immunocompetent persons, and VE varies among immunocompromised subgroups. Immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should receive three doses and a booster, consistent with CDC recommendations,5 practice nonpharmaceutical interventions, and, if infected, be monitored closely and considered early for proven therapies that can prevent severe outcomes. Data came from the VISION Network, a collaboration between CDC and seven US health-care systems and research centers with integrated medical, laboratory, and vaccination records that was established to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.6 Eligible hospitalizations were defined as those among adults aged ≥18 years with SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing (from 14 days before through 72 h after admission) and a COVID-19–like illness discharge diagnosis.4 Encounters without molecular testing were excluded from this analysis. Immunocompromised patients were defined by the presence of at least one selected discharge diagnosis for immunocompromising conditions using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Diagnoses across five categories of immunocompromising conditions were derived from lists used in previous studies of large hospital-based or administrative databases and included the following conditions: (1) solid malignancies, (2) hematologic malignancies, (3) rheumatologic or inflammatory disorders, (4) other intrinsic immune conditions or immunodeficiencies, and (5) organ or stem cell transplants.7-9 Immunosuppressive medication use data were not available for these analyses. Vaccination status was documented in electronic health records or state immunization registries.6 Full vaccination was defined as receipt of the second in a two-dose series of Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines ≥14 days before the index hospitalization date; unvaccinated patients had not received any COVID-19 vaccine doses and were considered the referent group. Patients who received (1) only one mRNA vaccine dose, (2) ≥3 mRNA vaccine doses, (3) the second dose <14 days before index hospitalization date, or (4) the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson [Ad26.COV2]) vaccine were excluded from the analysis. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using a test-negative design comparing the odds of a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients using multivariable logistic regression models. VE was adjusted for age, geographic region, calendar time (days from January 1 to hospitalization), and local virus circulation in the community where each partner site was located and weighted for inverse propensity to be vaccinated or unvaccinated (calculated separately for each VE estimate). Generalized boosted regression trees were used to estimate the propensity to be vaccinated based on sociodemographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, known previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospital characteristics. VE estimates were stratified by immunocompromised status, mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product received, age group, and network partner (representing different health-care systems and geographic regions). Among immunocompromised patients, VE was also calculated separately among subgroups of patients with each of the five categories of immunocompromising diagnoses (subgroups that were not mutually exclusive). VE was also calculated separately for hospitalizations occurring before and after the period when the Delta variant accounted for ≥50% of sequenced isolates within each site's state.10 VE estimates with 95% CIs that did not overlap were considered statistically different, which is a conservative approach. This study was reviewed and approved by Westat, Inc. institutional review board.5 Among 69,116 immunocompetent adults and 20,101 immunocompromised adults hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness and with available molecular testing results for SARS-CoV-2, 29,456 (43%) and 10,564 (53%), respectively, were fully vaccinated (Table 1). The median ages of immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 52–79 years) and 70 years (IQR = 60–78 years), respectively. Among immunocompetent patients, 42% had received the Moderna vaccine and 58% had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and among immunocompromised patients, 41% and 59% had received Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, respectively. Among immunocompetent patients, the median interval from receipt of the second vaccine dose to hospital admission was 89 days (IQR = 52–129 days) among Moderna vaccine recipients and 90 days (IQR = 52–131 days) among Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients; among immunocompromised patients, the intervals were 89 days (IQR = 52–128 days) and 89 days (IQR = 53–128 days) for Moderna vaccine and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients, respectively. Among immunocompetent patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory-confirmed in 9,853 (24.8%) unvaccinated and 1,108 (3.8%) fully vaccinated persons, compared with 1,127 (11.8%) unvaccinated and 410 (3.9%) fully vaccinated immunocompromised patients (Table 2). VE of two doses of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 hospitalization was lower among immunocompromised patients (77%) than among immunocompetent patients (90%). Differences persisted when analyzed among patients aged 18–64 years and aged ≥65 years, and among Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients. Among immunocompromised patients, VE was 81% for the Moderna vaccine and 71% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine; however, CIs slightly overlapped between these two estimates. VE was similarly lower among immunocompromised than among immunocompetent patients both before the period of Delta variant predominance (76%; 95% CI = 69%–81% vs 91%; 95% CI = 90%–93%) and during the period of Delta variant predominance (79%; 95% CI = 74%–83% vs 90%; 95% CI = 89%–91%). Across network partners, VE point estimates varied more for immunocompromised patients (57%–85%) than for immunocompetent patients (84%–94%). Among immunocompromised patients, 8,887 (44%) had a solid malignancy (range across network partners = 34%–47%), 2,790 (14%) had a hematologic malignancy (range = 11%–19%), 5,024 (25%) had a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder (range = 22%–30%), 6,380 (32%) had another intrinsic immune condition or immunodeficiency (range = 29%–37%), and 1,416 (7%) had received an organ or stem cell transplant (range = 4%–10%). VE point estimates ranged from 59% (organ or stem cell transplant patients) to 81% (patients with a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder) across these subgroups (Table 3). Subgroup VE point estimates were generally higher for the Moderna vaccine than for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but were the same among patients with a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder. In a multistate analysis of approximately 89,000 hospitalizations of adults with COVID-19–like illness during January 17–September 5, 2021, receipt of two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations among patients who were immunocompromised (VE = 77%) and those who were immunocompetent (VE = 90%). Nonetheless, immunocompromised patients were significantly less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with immunocompetent patients, supporting the recommendation for administration of a third dose of mRNA vaccine to further enhance the protection of moderately to severely immunocompromised persons against severe COVID-19 outcomes.5 This study also found that VE was lower among certain subgroups of immunocompromised adults, such as solid organ or stem cell transplant recipients, than among others. These findings are consistent with other studies suggesting that certain immunocompromised persons experience an attenuated immune response to COVID-19 vaccines and make up a large proportion of hospitalizations for infections after vaccination.3, 4 The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was approximately two times greater among unvaccinated immunocompetent patients compared with unvaccinated immunocompromised patients. Because the study sample was restricted to patients hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness, this difference might be related to a variation in the prevalence of other respiratory virus infections between the two groups, although this is unable to be confirmed. A strength of the test-negative design is that such a difference is not expected to influence the validity of VE estimates stratified by immunocompromised status. The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, the use of selected discharge diagnoses as surrogates for presumed immunocompromised status and the absence of medication and other relevant data might have led to classification of persons as immunocompromised who were not; the opposite is also possible but is less likely. Second, selection bias might be possible if vaccination status influences the likelihood of receiving testing although a previous VISION Network study indicated that vaccination status did not affect receipt of testing.6 Third, despite the high specificity of COVID-19 vaccination status from these data sources, misclassification might be possible. Fourth, although inverse weights balanced unvaccinated and vaccinated hospitalized patients on sociodemographic and health characteristics, and further adjustments for age, geographic region, calendar time, and local virus circulation were made, unmeasured and residual confounding (e.g., mask-wearing and waning immunity) in this observational study might have biased these estimates. Fifth, the study only assessed mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and not the Janssen vaccine and included health-care systems in only nine states, limiting the potential for the findings of this study to be extrapolated. Finally, immunocompromising conditions were not mutually exclusive, and sparse data in smaller immunocompromised subgroups reduced VE precision, so it was not possible to determine the independent effect of each subgroup on VE. Immunocompromised persons benefit from and should receive COVID-19 vaccines. Given that VE is lower compared to immunocompetent patients, immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA vaccines should receive three doses and a booster 6 months after the third dose, consistent with CDC recommendations.5 In addition to vaccination, immunocompromised persons should implement nonpharmaceutical prevention strategies such as masking to help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, if infected with SARS-CoV-2, be monitored closely and considered early for proven therapies that might prevent progression to severe illness (e.g., monoclonal antibodies). Additional studies are needed to further characterize variation in VE among immunocompromised subpopulations and across geographic regions, determine the degree of improvements in VE conferred by additional COVID-19 vaccine doses in immunocompromised populations, evaluate whether different approaches to vaccine administration might improve VE (e.g., dosage timing or temporarily withholding immunosuppressants), and further evaluate possible differences in VE between vaccine products.

AB  - As a method of research, pragmatic trials are recommended so as to generate results that are applicable to real-world care. This intent is especially important for the millions of older adults who receive long-term care in thousands of nursing homes and assisted living communities across the country—and many millions more around the globe. This article presents key points raised by experts participating in a conference funded by the National Institute of Aging held at the 2021 conference of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-term Care Medicine. The purpose of the conference was to convene leading clinicians, researchers, and industry partners to address special considerations of pragmatic trials in long-term care. Cross-cutting and unique challenges and solutions to conducting pragmatic trials were discussed focusing on 3 areas of clinical relevance to long-term care: (1) functional care and outcomes, (2) psychosocial care and quality of life, and (3) medical care and outcomes, with a special focus on persons with dementia. Challenges and innovative solutions were organized across the 9 domains of the revised Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) Tool, and future research recommendations for pragmatic trials in long-term care were identified.

AB  - This study seeks to identify Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) biomarkers associated with postoperative delirium (POD) via meta-analysis.A comprehensive search was conducted. Studies met the following inclusion criteria: >18 years of age, identified POD with standardized assessment, and biomarker measured in the AT(N)-X (A = amyloid, T = tau, (N)=neurodegeneration, X-Other) framework. Exclusion criteria: focus on prediction of delirium, delirium superimposed on dementia, other neurologic or psychiatric disorders, or terminal delirium. Reviewers extracted and synthesized data for the meta-analysis.Meta-analysis.Patients with POD.Primary outcome: association between POD and ATN-X biomarkers. Secondary outcomes involved sample heterogeneity.28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Studies focused on inflammatory and neuronal injury biomarkers; there were an insufficient number of studies for amyloid and tau biomarker analysis. Two inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, and CRP) showed a significant relationship with POD (IL-6 n = 10, standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.70; CRP n = 14, SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33-0.74). Two neuronal injury biomarkers (blood-based S100B and NfL) were positively associated with POD (S100B n = 5, SMD: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.11-0.69; NFL n = 2, SMD: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.28-1.57). Of note, many analyses were impacted by significant study heterogeneity.This meta-analysis identified an association between certain inflammatory and neuronal injury biomarkers and POD. Future studies will need to corroborate these relationships and include amyloid and tau biomarkers in order to better understand the relationship between POD and ADRD.

AB  - The increasing use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures is forcing clinicians and health care systems to decide which to select and how to incorporate them into their records and clinical workflows. This overview addresses 3 topics related to these concerns. First, a literature review summarizes key psychometric and practical factors (such as reliability, responsiveness, computer adaptive testing, and interpretability) in choosing PROs for clinical practice. Second, 3 clinical decision support issues are highlighted: gathering PROs, electronic health record effect on providers, and incorporating PROs into clinical decision support design and implementation. Lastly, the salience of crosscutting domains as well as 9 key pragmatic decisions are reviewed. Crosscutting domains are those that are relevant across most medical and mental health conditions, such as the SPADE symptom pentad (sleep problems, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue) and physical functioning. The 9 pragmatic decisions include (1) generic vs disease-specific scales; (2) single- vs multidomain scales; (3) universal scales vs user-choice selection; (4) number of domains to measure; (5) prioritization of domains when multiple domains are assessed; (6) action thresholds; (7) clinical purpose (screening vs monitoring); as well as the (8) frequency and (9) logistical aspects of PRO administration.

AB  - Proxy report is essential for patients unable to complete patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures themselves and potentially beneficial when the caregiver perspective can complement patient report. In this study, we examine agreement between self-report by older adults and proxy report by their caregivers when completing PROs for pain, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms/impairments.Four PROs were administered by telephone to older adults and their caregivers followed by re-administration within 24 h in a random subgroup. The PROs included the PHQ-9 depression, GAD-7 anxiety, PEG pain, and SymTrak multi-dimensional symptom and functional status scales.The sample consisted of 576 older adult and caregiver participants (188 patient-caregiver dyads, 200 patients without identified caregiver). The four measures had good internal (Cronbach's alpha, 0.76 to 0.92) and test-retest (ICC, 0.63 to 0.92) reliability whether completed by patients or caregivers. Total score and item-level means were relatively similar for both patient and caregiver reports. Agreement for total score as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was better for SymTrak-23 (0.48) and pain (0.58) than for anxiety (0.28) and depression (0.25). Multinomial modeling showed higher (worse) patient-reported scale scores were associated with caregiver underreporting, whereas higher caregiver task difficulty was associated with overreporting.When averaged over individuals at the group level, proxy reports of PRO scores by caregivers tend to approximate patient reports. For individual patients, proxy report should be interpreted more cautiously for psychological symptoms as well as when patient-reported symptoms are more severe, or caregiver task difficulty is high.Assessment of patient-reported outcomes (e.g., symptoms, functional status, and other quality of life domains) by a proxy on behalf of the patient is helpful when patient self-report is not possible or when a complementary perspective may inform care. Determining how well older adult patients and their caregivers agree on the patient’s pain, depression, anxiety, and functioning is important in investigating and managing these core clinical domains. In this study, patient-caregiver agreement was evaluated for four commonly-used scales that assess depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), pain (PEG), and multi-dimensional symptom and functional impairment (SymTrak). Total score and item-level scores were similar between patients and caregivers when averaged at the group level. Agreement was higher for more physically oriented domains (pain and SymTrak) than psychological conditions (depression and anxiety). Higher (worse) patient-reported scale scores were associated with caregiver underreporting, whereas higher caregiver task difficulty was associated with overreporting. Proxy report may be sufficiently accurate in research when studying group differences. However, proxy reports should be interpreted more cautiously in individual patients with psychological symptoms or higher symptom severity, or where there is caregiver diffficulty.

AB  - To describe the perspectives of Regenstrief LOINC Mapping Assistant (RELMA) users before and after the deployment of Community Mapping features, characterize the usage of these new features, and analyze the quality of mappings submitted to the community mapping repository.We evaluated Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) community members' perceptions about new "wisdom of the crowd" information and how they used the new RELMA features. We conducted a pre-launch survey to capture users' perceptions of the proposed functionality of these new features; monitored how the new features and data available via those features were accessed; conducted a follow-up survey about the use of RELMA with the Community Mapping features; and analyzed community mappings using automated methods to detect potential errors.Despite general satisfaction with RELMA, nearly 80% of 155 respondents to our pre-launch survey indicated that having information on how often other users had mapped to a particular LOINC term would be helpful. During the study period, 200 participants logged into the RELMA Community Mapping features an average of 610 times per month and viewed the mapping detail pages a total of 6686 times. Fifty respondents (25%) completed our post-launch survey, and those who accessed the Community Mapping features unanimously indicated that they were useful. Overall, 95.3% of the submitted mappings passed our automated validation checks.When information about other institutions' mappings was made available, study participants who accessed it agreed that it was useful and informed their mapping choices. Our findings suggest that a crowd-sourced repository of mappings is valuable to users who are mapping local terms to LOINC terms.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives The illness management and recovery scale‐clinician version ( IMRS ‐ C ) is a measure of outcomes thought to be important indicators of progress for consumers participating in illness management and recovery ( IMR ). Prior research has examined the psychometric properties of the IMRS ‐ C ; extant research supports certain aspects of the scale's reliability (test–retest) and validity (sensitivity to interventions). Analyses based on Rasch provide certain advantages and have not been applied to the IMRS ‐ C . Method This study used an archival IMRS database including responses regarding 697 participants with severe mental illness from a variety of community‐based settings. Rasch analyses were utilized to determine item functioning and utility of the IMRS ‐ C . Results Results of Rasch analyses using the IMRS ‐ C as one unidimensional scale were problematic. Analyses grouping items into three separate scales measuring recovery, management and biological vulnerability were more promising, but the third scale had other limitations. Conclusions Results suggest that the items included in the IMRS ‐ C can form two screeners, one for recovery and one for management; items regarding biological vulnerability were inadequate. The assessment could be supplemented by more refined measures of coping/self‐management and recovery constructs.

We define “mandate” as the strongly preferred, legally enforced option of government to require the recommended series of vaccinations be completed by every child as a condition of entry into larger social settings, such as regulated daycares and schools. We recommend mandatory vaccination as a state-enforced preference for treatment, restricting the grounds available to refuse, and using enforcement measures for nonparticipation, such as exclusion from certain services (eg, school) or imposing fiscal penalties (eg, denial or reduction of a child care tax exemption).3Wynia MK Mandating vaccination: what counts as a “mandate” in public health and when should they be used?.Am J. 2007; 7: 2-6Google Scholar However, we do not believe a measles mandate should result in either forced vaccination or criminal action against nonparticipants.Measles is among the most transmissible viral illnesses: It can live for up to 2 h outside the body in the air or on surfaces, individuals are considered contagious before becoming symptomatic, and early symptoms are nonspecific.4Measles (Rubeola) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.http://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htmlGoogle Scholar Complications (although rare) may be severe, especially in children, and no treatments are available. Consequently, some estimate community vaccination coverage levels must be 96% to 99% to protect against measles.5Rubio PP Is the basic reproductive number (R0) for measles viruses observed in recent outbreaks lower than in the pre-vaccination era?.Eurosurveillance. 2012; 17: 5Google Scholar Furthermore, given shifts in psychology surrounding infectious diseases as they become less prevalent, increased and geographically clustered rates of vaccine refusal, and recent evidence that communication efforts surrounding measles-mumps-rubella vaccination may not be as effective as hoped, 6Nyhan B Reifler J Richey S Freed GL Effective messages in vaccine promotion: a randomized trial.Pediatrics. 2014; 133: e835-e842Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 7Hendrix KS Finnell SM Zimet GD Sturm LA Lane KA Downs SM Vaccine message framing and parents' intent to immunize their infants for MMR.Pediatrics. 2014; 134: e675-e683Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar mandates are necessary to maximize the chances of attaining necessary coverage levels to deter measles outbreaks.EthicsA mandate impinges upon individual autonomy, privacy, and liberty rights and challenges parental rights. However, by protecting individuals from infectious disease, reducing morbidity and mortality, conferring protection for those of poor health and/or immunocompromised status, and facilitating herd immunity, the vaccination process is both medical intervention and public health measure, an individual and a societal good. Therefore, the germane ethical considerations cannot be limited to those impacting individuals; it is necessary to consider the policy in a public health ethics context.8Kass NE An ethics framework for public health.Am J Public Health. 2001; 91: 1776-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google ScholarVaccination mandates facilitate realization of critical public health goals—the US policy, coupled with education and outreach to vulnerable and remote populations, led to elimination of endemic measles in 2000.

Those unable to participate because of illness could be accommodated through well-structured medical exemption protocols. Secondary burdens of a mandate include individual liberty infringement and consequences imposed for nonparticipation, such as school or daycare exclusion. However, measles infectiousness, coupled with the heterogeneous and mobile nature of some populations,10Rashid H Khandaker G Booy R Vaccination and herd immunity: what more do we know?.Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2012; 25: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar means that population-level protection can only be obtained through high vaccination rates. Compared with programs centered on education, accessibility, and incentives (eg, the United Kingdom), a mandate offers a stronger bulwark against declining vaccination rates. Focusing the mandate on children (who are most likely to be exposed to and adversely affected by measles and who would be offered lifelong protection against measles through vaccination), offering medical exemptions for those unable to be vaccinated (and, at most, a narrow nonmedical exemption for those with philosophical objections), and asking that those able to be vaccinated do so ensures a policy with maximal fairness/justice across the population and minimizes free-riding.11May T Silverman RD Free-riding, fairness and the rights of minority groups in exemption from mandatory childhood vaccination.Hum Vaccin. 2005; 1: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google ScholarJustice also demands that a government couple mandates with adequate infrastructure to facilitate comparable access by those from geographically, socioeconomically, or otherwise disadvantaged populations. In addition, robust public education, record keeping, and enforcement systems should also accompany mandates to maintain high levels of trust in vaccination and ensure mandate enactment. To enforce a mandate under suboptimal access conditions would further isolate vulnerable groups from critical social goods (such as access to childhood education). Those governments unable to provide near-universal vaccination access should focus efforts on increasing coverage through investment in public health systems, education, and incentives.US LawAll US states require children demonstrate proof of vaccination as a prerequisite of entry into schools; however, law structures, populations covered, and enforcement vary.12Yang YT Silverman RD Legislative prescriptions for controlling nonmedical vaccine exemptions.JAMA. 2015; 313: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar States with narrower available grounds for exemption have lower rates of exemptors and lower likelihood of a vaccine-preventable illness outbreaks.13Omer SB Pan WK Halsey NA et al.Nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements: secular trends and association of state policies with pertussis incidence.JAMA. 2006; 296: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google ScholarThe US Supreme Court has determined that the state, through police power and parens patriae authority, can override core rights, such as a family's religious beliefs and a parent's right to direct a child's upbringing, to advance the goal of protecting both an individual child and the community from public health threats like measles. As the Court stated in the 1944 Prince v Massachusetts decision, “The right to practice religion freely does not include the right to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.”14Prince v.

Therefore, steps to implement mandatory health policies may be seen as negatively paternalistic. We recognize that there is cultural and regional variability in levels of trust in government and health-care systems/providers, potentially leading to (or resulting from) suspicion of ulterior motives underlying immunization programs.The evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of measles vaccination as a protector of both individuals and populations is overwhelming. Therefore, although, in the abstract establishment of a vaccine mandate may be seen as trust damaging, that measles vaccination mandates are evidence-based and transparent insofar as the objectives and outcomes sought from the program is trust enhancing. Furthermore, the action is not a broad, sweeping, all-vaccines policy, but rather a targeted, healthenhancing measure, which also should foster goodwill.ConclusionsImplementing and enforcing a measles vaccination mandate ensures that, over time, an entire population will be maximally protected from this infectious, dangerous, and disruptive illness through the use of an effective, safe, and readily available public health intervention. Although it would be preferable to not need mandates because everyone trusts in vaccination for protecting not only themselves and their children but also society at large, unfortunately this is not the case in all settings, thereby necessitating the implementation of such mandates.

Measles is among the most transmissible viral illnesses: It can live for up to 2 h outside the body in the air or on surfaces, individuals are considered contagious before becoming symptomatic, and early symptoms are nonspecific.4Measles (Rubeola) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.http://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htmlGoogle Scholar Complications (although rare) may be severe, especially in children, and no treatments are available.

EthicsA mandate impinges upon individual autonomy, privacy, and liberty rights and challenges parental rights. However, by protecting individuals from infectious disease, reducing morbidity and mortality, conferring protection for those of poor health and/or immunocompromised status, and facilitating herd immunity, the vaccination process is both medical intervention and public health measure, an individual and a societal good.

TrustBecause public health initiatives are commonly undertaken through government action, trust in public health is tied to trust in government itself. Therefore, steps to implement mandatory health policies may be seen as negatively paternalistic. We recognize that there is cultural and regional variability in levels of trust in government and health-care systems/providers, potentially leading to (or resulting from) suspicion of ulterior motives underlying immunization programs.The evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of measles vaccination as a protector of both individuals and populations is overwhelming. Therefore, although, in the abstract establishment of a vaccine mandate may be seen as trust damaging, that measles vaccination mandates are evidence-based and transparent insofar as the objectives and outcomes sought from the program is trust enhancing. Furthermore, the action is not a broad, sweeping, all-vaccines policy, but rather a targeted, healthenhancing measure, which also should foster goodwill.

Although it would be preferable to not need mandates because everyone trusts in vaccination for protecting not only themselves and their children but also society at large, unfortunately this is not the case in all settings, thereby necessitating the implementation of such mandates.

AB  - Little is known about health care use in the cognitive impairment, not dementia (CIND) subpopulation. Using a cohort of 7130 persons aged 71 years or over from the Health and Retirement Survey, we compared mean and total health care use from 2002 to 2008 for those with no cognitive impairment, CIND, or dementia in 2002. Cognitive status was determined using a validated method based on self or proxy interview measures. Health care use was also based on self or proxy reports. On the basis of the Health and Retirement Survey, the CIND subpopulation in 2002 was 5.3 million or 23% of the total population 71 years of age or over. Mean hospital nights was similar and mean nursing home nights was less in persons with CIND compared with persons with dementia. The CIND subpopulation, however, had more total hospital and nursing home nights—71,000 total hospital nights and 223,000 total nursing home nights versus 32,000 hospital nights and 138,000 nursing home nights in the dementia subpopulation. A relatively large population and high health care use result in a large health care impact of the CIND subpopulation.

AB  - We suggest a model framework, in which an individual patient's risk for colonic neoplasia varies based on findings from his previous colonoscopies, to predict longitudinal colonoscopy results. The neoplasia natural history model describes progression through four neoplasia development states with patient age. Multiple natural history model parameter sets are assumed to act concurrently on the colon and parameter set prevalence combinations, whose a priori likelihoods are a function of patient sex, provide a basis set for patient-level predictions. The novelty in this approach is that after a colonoscopy, both the parameter set combination likelihoods and their model predictions can adjust in a Bayesian manner based on the results and conditions of the colonoscopy. The adjustment of model predictions operationalizes the clinical knowledge that multiple or advanced neoplasia at baseline colonoscopy is an independent predictor of multiple or advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy--and vice versa for negative colonoscopies--and the adjustment of parameter set combination likelihoods accounts for the possibility that patients may have different neoplasia development rates. A model that accurately captures serial colonoscopy results could potentially be used to design and evaluate post-colonoscopy treatment strategies based on the risk of individual patients. To support model identification, observational longitudinal colonoscopy results, procedure details, and patient characteristics were collected for 4084 patients. We found that at least two parameter sets specific to each sex with model adjustments was required to capture the longitudinal colonoscopy data and inclusion of multiple possible parameter set combinations, which account for random variations within the population, was necessary to accurately predict the second-time colonoscopy findings for patients with a history of advanced adenomas. Application of this model to predict CRC risks for patients adhering to guideline recommended follow-up colonoscopy intervals found that there are significant differences in risk with patient age, gender, and preparation quality and demonstrates the need for a more rigorous investigation into these recommendations.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the design for comparing the performance of two binary classification rules, for example, two record linkage algorithms or two screening tests. Statistical methods are well developed for comparing these accuracy measures when the gold standard is available for every unit in the sample, or in a two-phase study when the gold standard is ascertained only in the second phase in a subsample using a fixed sampling scheme. However, these methods do not attempt to optimize the sampling scheme to minimize the variance of the estimators of interest. In comparing the performance of two classification rules, the parameters of primary interest are the difference in sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values. We derived the analytic variance formulas for these parameter estimates and used them to obtain the optimal sampling design. The efficiency of the optimal sampling design is evaluated through an empirical investigation that compares the optimal sampling with simple random sampling and with proportional allocation. Results of the empirical study show that the optimal sampling design is similar for estimating the difference in sensitivities and in specificities, and both achieve a substantial amount of variance reduction with an over-sample of subjects with discordant results and under-sample of subjects with concordant results. A heuristic rule is recommended when there is no prior knowledge of individual sensitivities and specificities, or the prevalence of the true positive findings in the study population. The optimal sampling is applied to a real-world example in record linkage to evaluate the difference in classification accuracy of two matching algorithms. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Despite growing interest in patient engagement, the concept remains poorly defined. Moreover, patients’ perspectives on engagement are lacking, particularly those of minority patients. A better understanding of patients’ views and what influences their engagement in health services will facilitate better patient education and implementation practices to enhance patient participation in health care. This article addresses patients’ perspectives of facilitators and barriers to engagement in outpatient mental health services. Forty-nine African-American veterans with mental illness receiving routine medication management visits were interviewed. Qualitative data analysis was guided by a constructivist grounded theory approach. Participants identified several barriers and facilitators to engagement in mental health services, including patient as well as provider-related factors. Results emphasize the role of providers in facilitating sustained involvement of patients in their own care. Based on the findings, the authors offer a preliminary framework for patient engagement that encompasses patient and provider factors.

AB  - Quality indicators of health care should measure endpoints that closely reflect patient outcomes. Further, they should be feasible to measure accurately in clinical practice and demonstrate evidence of variable performance. An additional important consideration is the potential for a candidate quality indicator to distort provider behavior in ways that could adversely affect patient outcomes or costs of care or that could be gamed, where the target measure is achieved but without reflecting high-quality care. “Gaming” in reference to quality indicators refers to behaviors that help satisfy the target set for the indicator but do not improve and are likely to detract from optimal or the most cost-effective patient care.

AB  - A collection of articles in this issue examine the concept of mastery learning, underscoring that our journey is from a 19th-century construct for assuring skill development (i.e., completing a schedule of rotations driven by the calendar) to a 21st-century sequence of learning opportunities focused on acquiring mastery of special key competencies within clerkships or other activities. Mastery learning processes and standards have the potential to clarify learning goals and competency measurement issues in medical education. Although mastery learning methods originally focused on developing learners' competency with skillful procedures, the author of this Commentary posits that mastery learning methods may be usefully applied more extensively to broader domains of skillful practice, especially those practices that can be linked to outcomes of care. The transition to mastery-focused criteria for educational advancement is laudatory, but challenges will be encountered in the journey to mastery education. The author examines several of these potential challenges, including expansion of mastery learning approaches to effective but relational clinician advice-giving and counseling behaviors, developing criteria for choosing critical competencies that can be linked to outcomes, avoiding a excessively fragmented approach to mastery measurement, and dealing with "educational comorbidity."

AB  - Signs and symptoms of heart failure can occur at any time. Differences between acute heart failure (AHF) patients who present at nighttime vs daytime and their outcomes have not been well studied. Our objective was to determine if there are differences in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between AHF patients presenting during daytime vs nighttime hours within an international, clinical trial.This is a post hoc analysis of the RELAX AHF trial, which randomized 1,161 AHF patients to serelaxin vs placebo, both in addition to usual AHF therapy. Prespecified end points of the primary trial were used: dyspnea, 60-day heart failure/renal failure rehospitalization or cardiovascular (CV) death, and 180-day CV death. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses for outcomes stratified by daytime vs nighttime presentation were performed.Of the 1,161 RELAX-AHF patients, 775 (66.8%) patients presented during daytime and 386 (33.2%) at nighttime. Baseline characteristics were largely similar, although daytime patients were more likely to be male, have greater baseline body weight, have higher New York Heart Association class, have history of atrial fibrillation, and have more peripheral edema compared with nighttime patients. No differences in dyspnea relief or 60-day outcomes were observed. However, daytime presentation was associated with greater risk for 180-day CV death after adjustment (hazard ratio 2.28, 95% CI 1.34-3.86; c statistic = 0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.86).In this secondary analysis of the RELAX-AHF trial, baseline characteristics suggest that daytime-presenting patients may have more gradual worsening of chronic HF. Patients with AHF who presented at night had less risk for 180-day CV death, but similar risk for 60-day CV death or rehospitalization and symptom improvement for patients who presented during the daytime.

AB  - Early-detection tests for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are needed. Since a hypothetical screening test would be applied during antecedent clinical encounters, we sought to define the variability in health-care utilization leading up to PDAC diagnosis. This was a retrospective cohort study that included patients diagnosed with PDAC in the Indianapolis, Indiana, area between 1999 and 2013 with at least 1 health-care encounter during the antecedent 36-month period (n = 1,023). Patients were classified by unique patterns of health-care utilization using a group-based trajectory model. The prevalences of PDAC signals, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic pancreatitis, were compared. Four distinct trajectories were identified, the most common (42.0%) being having few clinical encounters more than 6 months prior to PDAC diagnosis (late acceleration). In all cases, a minority of persons had DM (30.6%, with 9.5% <1.5 years before PDAC) or any pancreatic disorder (39.9%); these were least common in the late-acceleration group (DM, 14.7%; any pancreatic disorder, 32.1% (P < 0.001)). The most common pattern of antecedent care was having few clinical encounters until shortly before PDAC diagnosis. Since the majority of patients diagnosed with PDAC do not have an antecedent PDAC signal, early-detection strategies limited to these groups may not apply to the majority of cases.

AB  - Increasingly, health care providers need to exchange information to meet policy expectations and business needs. A variety of health information organizations (HIOs) provide services to facilitate health information exchange (HIE). However, the future of these organizations is unclear.The aim of this study was to explore the environmental context, potential futures, and survivability of community HIOs, enterprise HIEs, and electronic health record vendor-mediated exchange using the population ecology theory.Qualitative interviews with 33 key informants representing each type of HIE organization were analyzed using template analysis.Community HIOs, enterprise HIEs, and electronic health record vendors exhibited a high degree of competition for resources, especially in the area of exchange infrastructure services. Competition resulted in closures in some areas. In response to environmental pressures, each organizational type was endeavoring to differentiate its services and unique use case, as well as pursing symbiotic relationships or attempting resource partitioning.HIOs compete for similar resources and are reacting to environmental pressures to better position themselves for continued survival and success. Our ecological research perspective helps move the discourse away from situation of a single exchange organization type toward a view of the broader dynamics and relationships of all organizations involved in facilitating HIE activities.HIOs are attempting to partition the environment and differentiate services. HIE options should not be construed as an "either/or" decision, but one where multiple and complementary participation may be required.

AB  - Behavioral interventions for weight loss have been less effective in lower income and black women. These poorer outcomes may in part be related to these women having more frequent exposures to social and physical situations that are obesogenic, i.e., eating and sedentary cues or situations. Working with obese, lower income Black and White Women, Addressing People and Place Microenvironments (APP-Me) was designed to create awareness of self-behavior at times and places of frequent eating and sedentary behavior. APP-Me is being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with 240 participants recruited from federally qualified health centers located in a single Midwestern city. All participants complete four weeks of ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of situations and behavior. At the end of the four weeks, participants are randomized to enhanced usual care (UC) or UC plus APP-Me. APP-Me is an automated short messaging system (SMS). Messages are text, image, audio, or a combination, and are delivered to participants' mobile devices with the intent of creating awareness at the times and places of frequent eating or sedentary behavior. The EMA data inform the timing of message deliveries. This project aims to create and test timely awareness messages in a subpopulation that has not responded well to traditional behavioral interventions for weight loss. Novel aspects of the study include the involvement of a low income population, the use of data on time and place of obesogenic behavior, and message delivery time tailored to an individual's behavioral patterns.

AB  - Objective Anaemia is associated with higher mortality among patients with non-stroke cardiovascular conditions; less is known regarding the relationship between anaemia and mortality among patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Methods Medical records were abstracted for n=3965 veterans from 131 Veterans Health Administration facilities who were admitted with ischaemic stroke in fiscal year 2007. Haematocrit values within 24 hours of admission were classified as ≤27%, 28%–32%, 33%–37%, 38%–42%, 43%–47% or ≥48%. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between anaemia and in-hospital, 30-day, 6-month and 1-year mortality, adjusting for age, medical comorbidities, modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-III and stroke severity. Impact factors were calculated to standardise comparisons between haematocrit tier and other covariates. Results Among n=3750 patients included in the analysis, the haematocrit values were ≤27% in 2.1% (n=78), 28%–32% in 6.2% (n=234), 33%–37% in 17.9% (n=670), 38%–42% in 36.4% (n=1366), 43%–47% in 28.2% (n=1059) and ≥48% in 9.1% (n=343). Patients with haematocrit ≤27%, compared with patients in the 38%–42% range, were more likely to have died across all follow-up intervals, with statistically significant adjusted ORs (aORs) ranging from 2.5 to 3.5. Patients with polycythaemia (ie, haematocrit ≥48%) were at increased risk of in-hospital mortality (aOR=2.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 6.0), compared with patients with mid-range admission haematocrits. Pronounced differences between patients receiving and not receiving blood transfusion limited our ability to perform a propensity analysis. Impact factors in the 1-year mortality model were 0.46 (severe anaemia), 0.06 (cancer) and 0.018 (heart disease). Conclusions Anaemia is independently associated with an increased risk of death throughout the first year post stroke; high haematocrit is associated with early poststroke mortality. Severe anaemia is associated with 1-year mortality to a greater degree than cancer or heart disease. These data cannot address the question of whether interventions targeting anaemia might improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Our previous study showed that the issue of drug library update delays on wireless intravenous (IV) infusion pumps of one major vendor was widespread and significant. However, the impact of such a delay was unclear. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of pump library update delays on patient safety in terms of missed and false infusion programming alerts.The study data sets included infusion logs and drug libraries from three hospitals of one health system from January 2015 to December 2016. We identified limit setting changes of any two consecutive drug library versions. We quantified the impact of using outdated drug limit settings by missed and false infusion programming alerts.Twenty-five updates of the drug library were released within the health system during the 2-year period with an average interval of 28.8 days. After a new library version was issued, it took at least 6 days for 50% of all pumps to become up-to-date and 15 days or more to reach 80%. All three hospitals had at least 16% of all IV infusions programmed with outdated libraries. This resulted in 18%, 24.4%, and 27% of false alerts in the three hospitals, respectively. We identified two cases of missed alert infusions of high-risk medications, propofol, and potassium chloride, which could have negatively impacted patient safety.These findings support our assumption that potential serious harm can happen when IV infusions are administered with outdated drug limit settings due to delays in drug library updates on the pump.

AB  - Abstract Background Increased empathy may improve patient perceptions and outcomes. No training tool has been derived to teach empathy to emergency care providers. Accordingly, we engaged patients to assist in creating a concept map to teach empathy to emergency care providers. Methods We recruited patients, patient caretakers and patient advocates with emergency department experience to participate in three separate focus groups ( n = 18 participants). Facilitators guided discussion about behaviors that physicians should demonstrate to rapidly create trust; enhance patient perception that the physician understood the patient's point of view, needs, concerns, and fears; and optimize patient/caregiver understanding of their experience. Verbatim transcripts from the three focus groups were read by the authors, and by consensus, five major themes with 10 minor themes were identified. After creating a codebook with thematic definitions, one author reviewed all transcripts to a library of verbatim excerpts coded by theme. To test for inter‐rater reliability, two other authors similarly coded a random sample of 40% of the transcripts. Authors independently chose excerpts that represented consensus and strong emotional responses from participants. Results Approximately 90% of opinions and preferences fell within 15 themes, with five central themes: provider transparency, acknowledgment of patient's emotions, provider disposition, trust in physician, and listening. Participants also highlighted the need for authenticity, context, and individuality to enhance empathic communication. For empathy map content, patients offered example behaviors that promote perceptions of physician warmth, respect, physical touch, knowledge of medical history, explanation of tests, transparency, and treating patients as partners. The resulting concept map was named the “Empathy Circle.” Conclusions Focus group participants emphasized themes and tangible behaviors to improve empathy in emergency care. These were incorporated into the Empathy Circle, a novel concept map that can serve as the framework to teach empathy to emergency care providers.

AB  - Background Adolescent pre-visit screening on patient-generated health data is a common and efficient practice to guide clinical decision making. However, proxy informants (eg, parents or caregivers) often complete these forms, which may lead to incorrect information or lack of confidentiality. Our objective was to improve the adolescent self-report rate on pre-visit screening. Methods We conducted an interventional study using an interrupted time series design to compare adolescent self-report rates (percent of adolescents ages 12−18 years completing their own pre-visit screening) over 16 months in general pediatric ambulatory clinics. We collected data using a computerized clinical decision support system with waiting room electronic tablet screening. Preintervention rates were low, and we created and implemented 2 electronic workflow alerts, one each to the patient/caregiver and clinical staff, reminding them that the adolescent should answer the questions independently. We included the first encounter from each adolescent and evaluated changes in adolescent self-reporting between pre- and postintervention periods using interrupted time series analysis. Results Patients or caregivers completed 2670 qualifying pre-visit screenings across 19 preintervention, 7 intervention, and 44 postintervention weeks. Self-reporting by younger adolescents nearly doubled, with a significant increase of 19.3 percentage points (confidence interval [CI], 9.1−29.5) from the baseline 20.5%. Among older adolescents, the stable baseline rate of 53.6% increased by 9.2 absolute percentage points (CI, −7.0 to 25.3). There were no significant pre- or postintervention secular trends. Conclusions Two automated alerts directing clinic personnel and families to have adolescents self-report significantly and sustainably improved younger adolescent self-reporting on electronic patient-generated health data instruments.

AB  - Decision support system designs often do not align with the information environments in which clinicians work. These work environments may increase Clinicians' cognitive workload and harm their decision making. The objective of this study was to identify information needs and decision support requirements for assessing, diagnosing, and treating chronic noncancer pain in primary care. We conducted a qualitative study involving 30 interviews with 10 primary care clinicians and a subsequent multidisciplinary systems design workshop. Our analysis identified four key decision requirements, eight clinical information needs, and four decision support design seeds. Our findings indicate that clinicians caring for chronic pain need decision support that aggregates many disparate information elements and helps them navigate and contextualize that information. By attending to the needs identified in this study, decision support designers may improve Clinicians' efficiency, reduce mental workload, and positively affect patient care quality and outcomes.

AB  - In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), family members experience psychological and spiritual distress as they cope with fear, grief, and medical decisions for patients. The study team developed and pilot tested a semistructured chaplain intervention that included proactive contact and spiritual assessment, interventions, and documentation. An interdisciplinary team developed the intervention, the Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention (SCAI) Framework. Three chaplains delivered the intervention to surrogates in two ICUs. There were 25 of 73 eligible patient/surrogate dyads enrolled. Surrogates had a mean age of 57.6, were 84% female and 32% African American. The majority (84%) were Protestant. All received at least one chaplain visit and 19 received three visits. All agreed they felt supported by the chaplains, and qualitative comments showed spiritual and emotional support were valued. A semistructured spiritual care intervention for ICU surrogates is feasible and acceptable. Future work is needed to demonstrate the intervention improves outcomes for surrogates and patients.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) has two clinical precursor stages of disease: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). However, the mechanism of progression is not well understood. Because gene co-expression network analysis is a well-known method for discovering new gene functions and regulatory relationships, we utilized this framework to conduct differential co-expression analysis to identify interesting transcription factors (TFs) in two publicly available datasets. We then used copy number variation (CNV) data from a third public dataset to validate these TFs. First, we identified co-expressed gene modules in two publicly available datasets each containing three conditions: normal, MGUS, and SMM. These modules were assessed for condition-specific gene expression, and then enrichment analysis was conducted on condition-specific modules to identify their biological function and upstream TFs. TFs were assessed for differential gene expression between normal and MM precursors, then validated with CNV analysis to identify candidate genes. Functional enrichment analysis reaffirmed known functional categories in MM pathology, the main one relating to immune function. Enrichment analysis revealed a handful of differentially expressed TFs between normal and either MGUS or SMM in gene expression and/or CNV. Overall, we identified four genes of interest (MAX, TCF4, ZNF148, and ZNF281) that aid in our understanding of MM initiation and progression.

AB  - Background Patients’ knowledge of heart failure (HF) is integral to improved outcomes. However, the HF literature has not adequately explored the nature of patients’ knowledge of HF as part of their lived experience. Objectives We aimed to characterize the nature of patients’ knowledge of HF, in the context of living with the disease. Methods We conducted a narrative synthesis of qualitative studies that addressed patients’ knowledge of HF. Studies were systematically searched and retrieved from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES databases. Findings were synthesized using an iterative coding process carried out by multiple analysts and reported following Enhancing Transparency in the Reporting of Qualitative Health Research (ENTREQ) criteria. Results Analysis of 73 eligible articles produced five themes: the content that comprises HF knowledge; development of HF knowledge over time; application of HF knowledge for decision making; communication of information between clinicians and patients; and patients’ experience of knowledge. Conclusion The nature of patients’ knowledge of HF is both explicit and implicit, dynamic, and personal. This multidimensional model of knowledge-in-context calls for equally multidimensional research and intervention design.

AB  - Current approaches to gathering sexually transmitted infection (STI) case information for surveillance efforts are inefficient and lead to underreporting of disease burden. Electronic health information systems offer an opportunity to improve how STI case information can be gathered and reported to public health authorities. To test the feasibility of a standards-based application designed to automate STI case information collection and reporting, we conducted a pilot study where electronic laboratory messages triggered a FHIR-based application to query a patient's electronic health record for details needed for an electronic case report (eCR). Out of 214 cases observed during a one week period, 181 (84.6%) could be successfully confirmed automatically using the FHIR-based application. Data quality and information representation challenges were identified that will require collaborative efforts to improve the structure of electronic clinical messages as well as the robustness of the FHIR application.

AB  - Introduction International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in administrative health data are used to identify cases of disease, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), for population health research. The purpose of this review is to examine the extant literature on the reliability of ICD codes to correctly identify STIs. Methods We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles in which ICD codes were validated with respect to their ability to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Articles that included sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of ICD codes were the target. In addition to keyword searches in PubMed and Scopus databases, we further examined bibliographies of articles selected for full review to maximise yield. Results From a total of 1779 articles identified, only two studies measured the reliability of ICD codes to identify cases of STIs. Both articles targeted PID, a serious complication of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Neither article directly assessed the validity of ICD codes to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis independent of PID. Using ICD codes alone, the positive predictive value for PID was mixed (range: 18%–79%). Discussion and conclusion While existing studies have used ICD codes to identify STI cases, their reliability is unclear. Further, available evidence from studies of PID suggests potentially large variation in the accuracy of ICD codes indicating the need for primary studies to evaluate ICD codes for use in STI-related public health research.

AB  - BACKGROUND Geographic cohorting (GCh) localizes hospitalists to a unit. Our objective was to compare the GCh and non‐GCh workday. METHODS In an academic, Midwestern hospital we observed hospitalists in GCh and non‐GCh teams. Time in patient rooms was considered direct care; other locations were considered ‘indirect’ care. Geotracking identified time spent in each location and was obtained for 17 hospitalists. It was supplemented by in‐person observation of four GCh and four non‐GCh hospitalists for a workday each. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze associations between direct and indirect care time and team and workday characteristics. RESULTS Geotracking yielded 10,522 direct care episodes. GCh was associated with longer durations of patient visits while increasing patient loads were associated with shorter visits. GCh, increasing patient loads, and increasing numbers of units visited were associated with increased indirect care time. In‐person observations yielded 3,032 minutes of data. GCh hospitalists were observed spending 56% of the day in computer interactions vs non‐GCh hospitalists (39%; P &lt; .005). The percentage of time spent multitasking was 18% for GCh and 14% for non‐GCh hospitalists ( P &gt; .05). Interruptions were pervasive, but the highest interruption rate of once every eight minutes in the afternoon was noted in the GCh group. CONCLUSION GCh may have the potential to increase patient–hospitalist interactions but these gains may be attenuated if patient loads and the structure of cohorting are suboptimal. The hospitalist workday is cognitively intense. The interruptions noted may increase the time taken for time‐intensive tasks like electronic medical record interactions.

AB  - <h3>Background:</h3> The objective of this qualitative study is to better understand primary care clinician decision making for managing chronic pain. Specifically, we focus on the factors that influence changes to existing chronic pain management plans. Limitations in guidelines and training leave clinicians to use their own judgment and experience in managing the complexities associated with treating patients with chronic pain. This study provides insight into those judgments based on clinicians9 first-person accounts. Insights gleaned from this study could inspire innovations aimed at supporting primary care clinicians (PCCs) in managing chronic pain. <h3>Methods:</h3> We conducted 89 interviews with PCCs to obtain their first-person perspective of the factors that influenced changes in treatment plans for their patients. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, cognitive scientists, and public health researchers. <h3>Results:</h3> Seven themes emerged through our analysis of factors that influenced a change in chronic pain management: 1) change in patient condition; 2) outcomes related to treatment; 3) nonadherent patient behavior; 4) insurance constraints; 5) change in guidelines, laws, or policies; 6) approaches to new patients; and 7) specialist recommendations. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Our analysis sheds light on the factors that lead PCCs to change treatment plans for patients with chronic pain. An understanding of these factors can inform the types of innovations needed to support PCCs in providing chronic pain care. We highlight key insights from our analysis and offer ideas for potential practice innovations.

AB  - Study objective We describe the prevalence, trends, and factors associated with repeated emergency department (ED) encounters for opioid usage across multiple, independent hospital systems. Methods A statewide regional health information exchange system provided ED encounters from 4 Indiana hospital systems for 2012 to 2017. In accordance with a series of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 diagnosis codes for opioid abuse, adverse effects of opioids, opioid dependence and unspecified use, and opioid poisoning, we identified patients with an ED encounter associated with opioid usage (9,295 individuals; 12,642 encounters). Multivariate logistic regression models then described the patient, encounter, prescription history, and community characteristics associated with the odds of a patient’s incurring a subsequent opioid-related ED encounter. Results The prevalence of repeated nonfirst opioid-related ED encounters increased from 9.0% of all opioid encounters in 2012 to 34.3% in 2017. The number of previous opioid-related ED encounters, unique institutions at which the individual had had encounters, the encounter’s being heroin-related, the individual’s having a benzodiazepine prescription filled within 30 days before the encounter, and being either Medicaid insured or uninsured compared with private insurance were associated with significantly greater odds of having a subsequent encounter. Conclusion The ED is increasingly a site utilized as the setting for repeated opioid-related care. Characteristics of the individual, encounter, and community associated with repeated opioid-related encounters may inform real-time risk-prediction tools in the ED setting. Additionally, the number of institutions to which the individual has presented may suggest the utility of health information exchange data and usage in the ED setting.

AB  - Hemorrhage control is a basic task required of first responders and typically requires technical interventions during stressful circumstances. Remote telementoring (RTM) utilizes information technology to guide inexperienced providers, but when this is useful remains undefined.Military medics were randomized to mentoring or not from an experienced subject matter expert during the application of a wound clamp (WC) to a simulated bleed. Inexperienced, nonmentored medics were given a 30-second safety briefing; mentored medics were not. Objective outcomes were time to task completion and success in arresting simulated bleeding.Thirty-three medics participated (16 mentored and 17 nonmentored). All (100%) successfully applies the WC to arrest the simulated hemorrhage. RTM significantly slowed hemorrhage control (P = 0.000) between the mentored (40.4 ± 12.0 seconds) and nonmentored (15.2 ± 10.3 seconds) groups. On posttask questionnaire, all medics subjectively rated the difficulty of the wound clamping as 1.7/10 (10 being extremely hard). Discussion: WC application appeared to be an easily acquired technique that was effective in controlling simulated extremity exsanguination, such that RTM while feasible did not improve outcomes. Limitations were the lack of true stress and using simulation for the task. Future research should focus on determining when RTM is useful and when it is not required.

AB  - The effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in the early stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) remains a big challenge in AD research. So far, multiple biomarkers have been associated with AD diagnosis and progression. However, most of the existing research only utilized single modality data for diagnostic biomarker identification, which did not take the advantages of multi-modal data that provide comprehensive and complementary information at multiple levels into consideration. In this paper, we integrate multi-modal genomic data from postmortem AD brains (i.e., mRNA, miRNA and epigenomic data) and propose a hyper-graph based sparse canonical correlation analysis (HGSCCA) method to extract the most correlated multi-modal biomarkers associated with AD and MCI. Specifically, our model utilizes the sparse canonical correlation analysis framework (SCCA), which aims at finding the best linear projections for each input modality so that the strongest correlation within the selected features of multi-dimensional genomic data can be captured. In addition, with the consideration of high-order relationships among different subjects, we also introduce a hyper-graph-based regularization term that will lead to the selection of more discriminative biomarkers. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the experiments on the well-known AD cohort study, The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset, and the results show that our method can not only identify meaningful biomarkers for the diagnosis AD disease, but also achieve superior classification performance than the comparing methods.

AB  - Abstract Background Policymakers, legislators, and clinicians have raised concerns that hospital-based clinicians may be incentivized to inappropriately prescribe and administer opioids when addressing pain care needs of their patients, thus potentially contributing to the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States. Given the need to involve all healthcare settings, including hospitals, in joint efforts to curb the opioid epidemic, it is essential to understand if clinicians perceive hospitals as contributors to the problem. Therefore, we examined clinical perspectives on the role of hospitals in the opioid epidemic. Methods We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 23 clinicians from 6 different acute care hospitals that are part of a single healthcare system in the Midwestern United States. Our participants were hospitalists ( N = 12), inpatient registered nurses ( N = 9), and inpatient adult nurse practitioners ( N = 2). In the interviews, we asked clinicians whether hospitals play a role in the opioid epidemic, and if so, how hospitals may contribute to the epidemic. We used a qualitative thematic analysis approach to analyze coded text for patterns and themes and examined potential differences in themes by respondent type using Dedoose software. Results The majority of clinicians believed hospitals contribute to the opioid epidemic. Multiple clinicians cited Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) reimbursement policy and the Joint Commission’s report as drivers of inappropriate opioid prescribing in hospitals. Furthermore, numerous clinicians stated that opioids are inappropriately administered in the emergency department (ED), potentially as a mechanism to facilitate discharge and prevent re-admission. Many clinicians also described how overreliance on pre-populated pain care orders for surgical (orthopedic) patients, may be contributing to inappropriate opioid use in the hospital. Finally, clinicians suggested the following initiatives for hospitals to help address the crisis: 1) educating patients about negative consequences of using opioids long-term and setting realistic pain expectations; 2) educating medical staff about appropriate opioid prescribing practices, particularly for patients with complex chronic conditions (chronic pain; opioid use disorder (OUD)); and 3) strengthening the hospital leadership efforts to decrease inappropriate opioid use. Conclusions Our findings can inform efforts at decreasing inappropriate opioid use in hospitals.

AB  - Recruitment of diverse populations and subjects living in Medically Underserved Areas and Populations (MUA/P’s) into clinical trials is a considerable challenge. Likewise, representation of African-Americans in pharmacogenetic trials is often inadequate, but critical for identifying genetic variation within and between populations. To identify enrollment patterns and variables that predict enrollment in a diverse underserved population, we analyzed data from the INGENIOUS, (Indiana GENomics Implementation and Opportunity for the UnderServed), pharmacogenomics implementation clinical trial conducted at a community hospital for underserved subjects (Safety net hospital,) and a statewide healthcare system (Academic hospital). We used a logistic regression model to identify patient variables that predicted successful enrollment after subjects were contacted and evaluated the reasons that clinical trial eligible subjects refused enrollment. In both healthcare systems, African-Americans were less likely to refuse the study than non-Hispanic Whites (Safety net, OR =0.68, p<0.002; Academic hospital, OR=0.64, p<0.001). At the Safety net hospital, other minorities were more likely to refuse the study than non-Hispanic Whites (OR=1.58, p<0.04). The odds of refusing the study once contacted increased with patient age (Safety net hospital, OR=1.02, p<0.001, Academic hospital, OR=1.02 p< 0.001). At the Academic hospital, females were less likely to refuse the study than males (OR=0.81, p=0.01) and those not living in MUA/P’s were less likely to refuse the study than those living in MUA/P’s (OR=0.81, p=0.007). The most frequent barriers to enrollment included not being interested, being too busy, transportation, and illness. A lack of trust was reported less frequently. In conclusion, African-Americans can be readily recruited to pharmacogenetic clinical trials once contact has been successfully initiated. However, health care initiatives and increased recruitment efforts of subjects living in MUA/Ps are needed. Enrollment could be further enhanced by improving research awareness and knowledge of clinical trials, reducing time needed for participation, and compensating for travel.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project is a successful, multicomponent demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long‐stay nursing facility residents. To continue to reduce hospital transfers, a more detailed understanding of these transfer events is needed. The purpose of this study was to describe differences in transfer events that result in treatment in the hospital versus emergency department (ED) only. DESIGN OPTIMISTIC project nurses collected data on residents who transferred. Transfer events that resulted in treatment in ED versus hospitalization were compared using t ‐tests and chi‐square tests. A generalized estimating equations regression model was used to assess the associations between hospital admission and transfer characteristics. PARTICIPANTS A total of 867 long‐stay nursing facility residents enrolled in OPTIMISTIC, January 2015 to June 2016. MEASUREMENTS Resident and transfer characteristics from Minimum Data Set and project REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database, including demographics, cognitive status, comorbidities, symptoms at time of transfer, and diagnoses. RESULTS The most common symptoms associated with treatment in the ED only were falls, trauma, or fracture (38% vs 10% admitted). Residents with cognitive impairment were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (odds ratio (OR) = 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09–1.98; P = .011). Residents with respiratory complaints were more likely to be admitted (OR = 2.098; 95% CI = 1.198–3.675; P = .009); residents with hematological/bleeding (nongastrointestinal) (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.107–0.494; P = .0002), pain (OR = 0.421; 95% CI = 0.254–0.698; P = .0008), or fall/trauma/fracture (OR = 0.181; 95% CI = 0.12–0.272; P &lt; .001) were less likely to be admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION Some presenting symptoms and other characteristics are more associated with ED only treatment versus hospitalization. A knowledge of who is likely to receive ED only care could prompt adoption of targeted resources and protocols to further reduce these types of transfer events. Opportunity may exist in the ED as well to reduce hospitalizations and increase discharges back to the facility.

AB  - While researchers seek to use administrative health data to examine outcomes for individuals with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes used to identify persons with chlamydia and gonorrhea have not been validated. Objectives were to determine the validity of using ICD-10-CM codes to identify individuals with chlamydia and gonorrhea.We used data from electronic health records gathered from public and private health systems from October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016. Patients were included if they were aged 13 to 44 years and received either (1) laboratory testing for chlamydia or gonorrhea or (2) an ICD-10-CM diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or an unspecified STI. To validate ICD-10-CM codes, we calculated positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity based on the presence of a laboratory test result. We further examined the timing of clinical diagnosis relative to laboratory testing.The positive predictive values for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and unspecified STI ICD-10-CM codes were 87.6%, 85.0%, and 32.0%, respectively. Negative predictive values were high (>92%). Sensitivity for chlamydia diagnostic codes was 10.6%, and gonorrhea was 9.7%. Specificity was 99.9% for both chlamydia and gonorrhea. The date of diagnosis occurred on or after the date of the laboratory result for 84.8% of persons with chlamydia, 91.9% for gonorrhea, and 23.5% for unspecified STI.Disease-specific ICD-10-CM codes accurately identify persons with chlamydia and gonorrhea. However, low sensitivities suggest that most individuals could not be identified in administrative data alone without laboratory test results.

AB  - The Protocol-guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurologic Symptoms (PREVENT) program was designed to address systemic barriers to providing timely guideline-concordant care for patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA).We evaluated an implementation bundle used to promote local adaptation and adoption of a multi-component, complex quality improvement (QI) intervention to improve the quality of TIA care Bravata et al. (BMC Neurology 19:294, 2019).A stepped-wedge implementation trial with six geographically diverse sites.The six facility QI teams were multi-disciplinary, clinical staff.PREVENT employed a bundle of key implementation strategies: team activation; external facilitation; and a community of practice. This strategy bundle had direct ties to four constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR): Champions, Reflecting & Evaluating, Planning, and Goals & Feedback.Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the CFIR and data matrix analyses, we evaluated the degree to which implementation success and clinical improvement were associated with implementation strategies. The primary outcomes were the number of completed implementation activities, the level of team organization and > 15 points improvement in the Without Fail Rate (WFR) over 1 year.Facility QI teams actively engaged in the implementation strategies with high utilization. Facilities with the greatest implementation success were those with central champions whose teams engaged in planning and goal setting, and regularly reflected upon their quality data and evaluated their progress against their QI plan. The strong presence of effective champions acted as a pre-condition for the strong presence of Reflecting & Evaluating, Goals & Feedback, and Planning (rather than the other way around), helping to explain how champions at the +2 level influenced ongoing implementation.The CFIR-guided bundle of implementation strategies facilitated the local implementation of the PREVENT QI program and was associated with clinical improvement in the national VA healthcare system.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02769338.

AB  - The Recruitment Innovation Center (RIC), partnering with the Trial Innovation Network and institutions in the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, aimed to develop a service line to retrieve study population estimates from electronic health record (EHR) systems for use in selecting enrollment sites for multicenter clinical trials. Our goal was to create and field-test a low burden, low tech, and high-yield method.In building this service line, the RIC strove to complement, rather than replace, CTSA hubs' existing cohort assessment tools. For each new EHR cohort request, we work with the investigator to develop a computable phenotype algorithm that targets the desired population. CTSA hubs run the phenotype query and return results using a standardized survey. We provide a comprehensive report to the investigator to assist in study site selection.From 2017 to 2020, the RIC developed and socialized 36 phenotype-dependent cohort requests on behalf of investigators. The average response rate to these requests was 73%.Achieving enrollment goals in a multicenter clinical trial requires that researchers identify study sites that will provide sufficient enrollment. The fast and flexible method the RIC has developed, with CTSA feedback, allows hubs to query their EHR using a generalizable, vetted phenotype algorithm to produce reliable counts of potentially eligible study participants.The RIC's EHR cohort assessment process for evaluating sites for multicenter trials has been shown to be efficient and helpful. The model may be replicated for use by other programs.

AB  - Many individuals receiving post-acute and long-term care services in nursing homes have unmet palliative and end-of-life care needs. Hospice has been the predominant approach to meeting these needs, although hospice services generally are available only to long-term care residents with a limited prognosis who choose to forego disease-modifying or curative therapies. Two additional approaches to meeting these needs are the provision of palliative care consultation through community- or hospital-based programs and facility-based palliative care services. However, access to this specialized care is limited, services are not clearly defined, and the empirical evidence of these approaches’ effectiveness is inadequate. In this article, we review the existing evidence and challenges with each of these 3 approaches. We then describe a model for effective delivery of palliative and end-of-life care in nursing homes, one in which palliative and end-of-life care are seen as integral to high-quality nursing home care. To achieve this vision, we make 4 recommendations: (1) promote internal palliative and end-of-life care capacity through comprehensive training and support; (2) ensure that state and federal payment policies and regulations do not create barriers to delivering high-quality, person-centered palliative and end-of-life care; (3) align nursing home quality measures to include palliative and end-of-life care-sensitive indicators; and (4) support access to and integration of external palliative care services. These recommendations will require changes in the organization, delivery, and reimbursement of care. All nursing homes should provide high-quality palliative and end-of-life care, and this article describes some key strategies to make this goal a reality.

AB  - Screening supports early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Provision of fecal immunochemical tests/fecal occult blood tests (FIT/FOBT) in primary care can increase CRC screening, particularly in populations experiencing health disparities. This study was conducted to describe clinical workflows for FIT/FOBT in Oregon primary care practices and to identify specific workflow processes that might be associated (alone or in combination) with higher (versus lower) CRC screening rates.Primary care practices were rank ordered by CRC screening rates in Oregon Medicaid enrollees who turned age 50 years from January 2013 to June 2014 (i.e., newly age-eligible). Practices were recruited via purposive sampling based on organizational characteristics and CRC screening rates. Data collected were from surveys, observation visits, and informal interviews, and used to create practice-level CRC screening workflow reports. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, qualitative data analysis using an immersion-crystallization process, and a matrix analysis approach.All participating primary care practices (N=9) used visit-based workflows, and four higher performing and two lower performing used population outreach workflows to deliver FIT/FOBTs. However, higher performing practices (n=5) had more established workflows and staff to support activities. Visit-based strategies in higher performing practices included having dedicated staff identify patients due for CRC screening and training medical assistants to review FIT/FOBT instructions with patients. Population outreach strategies included having clinic staff generate lists and check them for accuracy prior to direct mailing of kits to patients. For both workflow types, higher performing clinics routinely utilized systems for patient reminders and follow-up after FIT/FOBT distribution.Primary care practices with higher CRC screening rates among newly age-eligible Medicaid enrollees had more established visit-based and population outreach workflows to support identifying patients due for screening, FIT/FOBT distribution, reminders, and follow up. Key to practices with higher CRC screening was having medical assistants discuss and review FIT/FOBT screening and instructions with patients. Findings present important workflow processes for primary care practices and may facilitate the implementation of evidence-based interventions into real-world, clinical settings.

Among 470,274 individuals in the vaccine-exposed cohort, 177 individuals (0.038%) met liver injury criteria after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Sixty percent were female, 90% White and average age at first vaccine was 70 years. The frequency of liver injury after vaccine was no different between mRNA and viral-vector vaccines (0.038% vs. 0.024%, p = 0.26). Liver injury was observed after the first dose in 14% and second dose in 86%. Average time to injury after the first dose was 29 ± 21 days and second was 45 ± 25 days. Liver injury pattern was hepatocellular in 45%, cholestatic in 35%, and mixed in 20%. Peak mean for AST, ALT, ALP and TB were 800 IU/L, 553 IU/L, 405 IU/L, and 3.1 mg/dl, respectively. 29% of patients ever had TB >2.5 mg/dl. Follow-up liver biochemistries were available in 42 patients with liver injury after vaccination and liver tests normalized in 48% of them (defined as serum ALT <45 U/L, ALP <250 U/L and TB <2.5 mg/dl). Mean duration between first abnormal to first normal TB was 8 ± 14 days.

AB  - Few studies have examined the longevity of endodontically treated teeth in nonacademic clinical settings where most of the population receives its care. This study aimed to quantify the longevity of teeth treated endodontically in general dentistry practices and test the hypothesis that longevity significantly differed by the patient's age, gender, dental insurance, geographic region, and placement of a crown and/or other restoration soon after root canal treatment (RCT). This retrospective study used deidentified data of patients who underwent RCT of permanent teeth through October 2015 in 99 general dentistry practices in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network (Network). The data set included 46,702 patients and 71,283 RCT permanent teeth. The Kaplan-Meier (product limit) estimator was performed to estimate survival rate after the first RCT performed on a specific tooth. The Cox proportional hazards model was done to account for patient- and tooth-specific covariates. The overall median survival time was 11.1 y; 26% of RCT teeth survived beyond 20 y. Tooth type, presence of dental insurance any time during dental care, placement of crown and/or receiving a filling soon after RCT, and Network region were significant predictors of survival time (P < 0.0001). Gender and age were not statistically significant predictors in univariable analysis, but in multivariable analyses, gender was significant after accounting for other variables. This study of Network practices geographically distributed across the United States observed shorter longevity of endodontically treated permanent teeth than in previous community-based studies. Also, having a crown placed following an RCT was associated with 5.3 y longer median survival time. Teeth that received a filling soon after the RCT before the crown was placed had a median survival time of 20.1 y compared to RCT teeth with only a crown (11.4 y), only a filling (11.2 y), or no filling and no crown (6.5 y).

AB  - Abstract Background Implementation Mapping is an organized method to select implementation strategies. However, there are 73 Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies. Thus, it is difficult for implementation scientists to map all potential strategies to the determinants of their chosen implementation science framework. Prior work using Implementation Mapping employed advisory panels to select implementation strategies. This article presents a data-driven approach to implementation mapping, in which we systematically evaluated all 73 ERIC strategies using the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework. We illustrate our approach using implementation of risk-aligned bladder cancer surveillance as a case example. Methods We developed objectives based on previously collected qualitative data organized by TICD determinants, i.e., what needs to be changed to achieve more risk-aligned surveillance. Next, we evaluated all 73 ERIC strategies, excluding those that were not applicable to our clinical setting. The remaining strategies were mapped to the objectives using data visualization techniques to make sense of the large matrices. Finally, we selected strategies with high impact, based on (1) broad scope, defined as a strategy addressing more than the median number of objectives, (2) requiring low or moderate time commitment from clinical teams, and (3) evidence of effectiveness from the literature. Results We identified 63 unique objectives. Of the 73 ERIC strategies, 45 were excluded because they were not applicable to our clinical setting (e.g., not feasible within the confines of the setting, not appropriate for the context). Thus, 28 ERIC strategies were mapped to the 63 objectives. Strategies addressed 0 to 26 objectives (median 10.5). Of the 28 ERIC strategies, 10 required low and 8 moderate time commitments from clinical teams. We selected 9 strategies based on high impact, each with a clearly documented rationale for selection. Conclusions We enhanced Implementation Mapping via a data-driven approach to the selection of implementation strategies. Our approach provides a practical method for other implementation scientists to use when selecting implementation strategies and has the advantage of favoring data-driven strategy selection over expert opinion.

AB  - This study is a scoping review of the different methods used to measure rurality in the health services research (HSR) literature.We identified peer-reviewed empirical studies from 2010-2020 from seven leading HSR journals, including the Journal of Rural Health, that used any definition to measure rurality as a part of their analysis. From each study, we identified the geographic unit (e.g., county, zip code) and definition (e.g., Rural Urban Continuum Codes, Rural Urban Commuting Areas) used to classify categories of rurality. We analyzed whether geographic units and definitions used to classify rurality differed by focus area of studies, including costs, quality, and access to care. Lastly, we examined the number of rural categories used by authors to assess rural areas.In 103 included studies, five different geographic units and 11 definitions were used to measure rurality. The most common geographic units used to measure rurality were county (n = 59, 57%), which was used most frequently in studies examining cost (n = 12, 75%) and access (n = 33, 57.9%). Rural Urban Commuting Area codes were the most common definition used to measure rurality for studies examining access (n = 13, 22.8%) and quality (n = 10, 44%). The majority of included studies made rural versus urban comparisons (n = 82, 80%) as opposed to focusing on rural populations only (n = 21, 20%). Among studies that compared rural and urban populations, most studies used only one category to identify rural locations (n = 49 of 82 studies, 60%).Geographic units and definitions to determine rurality were used inconsistently within and across studies with an HSR focus. This finding may affect how health disparities by rural location are determined and thus how resources and federal funds are allocated. Future research should focus on developing a standardized system to determine under what circumstances researchers should use different geographic units and methods to determine rurality by HSR focus area.

AB  - Advances in computational algorithms and tools have made the prediction of cancer patient outcomes using computational pathology feasible. However, predicting clinical outcomes from pre-treatment histopathologic images remains a challenging task, limited by the poor understanding of tumor immune micro-environments. In this study, an automatic, accurate, comprehensive, interpretable, and reproducible whole slide image (WSI) feature extraction pipeline known as, IMage-based Pathological REgistration and Segmentation Statistics (IMPRESS), is described. We used both H&E and multiplex IHC (PD-L1, CD8+, and CD163+) images, investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms using automatic feature extraction methods can predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in HER2-positive (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Features are derived from tumor immune micro-environment and clinical data and used to train machine learning models to accurately predict the response to NAC in breast cancer patients (HER2+ AUC = 0.8975; TNBC AUC = 0.7674). The results demonstrate that this method outperforms the results trained from features that were manually generated by pathologists. The developed image features and algorithms were further externally validated by independent cohorts, yielding encouraging results, especially for the HER2+ subtype.

AB  - Objective Physicians typically respond to roughly half of the clinical decision support prompts they receive. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that selectively highlighting prompts in yellow would improve physicians' responsiveness. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial using the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation clinical decision support system in 4 urban primary care pediatric clinics. Half of a set of electronic prompts of interest was highlighted in yellow when presented to physicians in 2 clinics. The other half of the prompts was highlighted when presented to physicians in the other 2 clinics. Analyses compared physician responsiveness to the 2 randomized sets of prompts: highlighted versus not highlighted. Additionally, several prompts deemed high priority were highlighted during the entire study period in all clinics. Physician response rates to the high-priority highlighted prompts were compared to response rates for those prompts from the year before the study period, when they were not highlighted. Results Physicians did not respond to prompts that were highlighted at higher rates than prompts that were not highlighted (62% and 61%, respectively; odds ratio 1.056, P = .259, NS). Similarly, physicians were no more likely to respond to high-priority prompts that were highlighted compared to the year before, when the prompts were not highlighted (59% and 59%, respectively, χ2 = 0.067, P = .796, NS). Conclusions Highlighting reminder prompts did not increase physicians' responsiveness. We provide possible explanations why highlighting did not improve responsiveness and offer alternative strategies to increasing physician responsiveness to prompts.

AB  - Computerized medication alerts can often be bypassed by entering an override rationale, but prescribers' override reasons are frequently ambiguous to pharmacists who review orders.To develop and evaluate a new override mechanism for adverse reaction and drug-drug interaction alerts. We hypothesized that the new mechanism would improve usability for prescribers and increase the clinical appropriateness of override reasons.A counterbalanced, crossover study was conducted with 20 prescribers in a simulated prescribing environment. We modified the override mechanism timing, navigation, and text entry. Instead of free-text entry, the new mechanism presented prescribers with a predefined set of override reasons. We assessed usability (learnability, perceived efficiency, and usability errors) and used a priori criteria to evaluate the clinical appropriateness of override reasons entered.Prescribers rated the new mechanism as more efficient (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.032). When first using the new design, 5 prescribers had difficulty finding the new mechanism, and 3 interpreted the navigation to mean that the alert could not be overridden. The number of appropriate override reasons significantly increased with the new mechanism compared with the original mechanism (median change of 3.0; interquartile range = 3.0; P < 0.0001).When prescribers were given a menu-based choice for override reasons, clinical appropriateness of these reasons significantly improved. Further enhancements are necessary, but this study is an important first step toward a more standardized menu of override choices. Findings may be used to improve communication through e-prescribing systems between prescribers and pharmacists.

Moreover, no formal systems of care exist and care delivery at a given SNF may vary substantially from other SNFs. Thus, it does not come as a surprise that many SNFs fail to follow evidence-based guidelines for medical management for various illnesses and health outcomes suffer. 3 Jung M. Yeh A.Y. Pressler S.J.

AB  - To determine the Treatment Needs Index (TNI) for dental caries, the restorative Care Index (CI), and to introduce a Tooth Extractions Index (TEI) to estimate past and current treatment needs among Mexican adolescents.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on 1538 adolescents aged 12 and 15 years in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, to collect decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) data to describe TNI, CI and TEI indices.Higher TNI was identified in younger male teenagers who had always lived in the same community, without dental visits in the last year, and who had poorer socio-economic markers. Higher CI was found in older, female subjects who had moved in their lifetimes to a new community in the area, with dental visits in the last year and who had better socio-economic markers. Higher TEI was found in older, female teenagers who had moved in their lifetimes to a new community in the area, without dental visits in the last year, and who had worse socio-economic markers.We observed high rates of treatment needs for dental caries and little experience of restorative treatment. While dental extractions due to advanced caries should ideally be zero, relatively few adolescents had this treatment experience. Despite the fact that the overall background of these adolescents is rather homogeneous, it was still possible to find that treatment needs' indices (past and present needs) appeared to be modified by sociodemographic and socio-economic variables.

AB  - Race and ethnicity affect children's risk of secondhand smoke exposure. However, little is known about how race and language preference impact parents' self-reported smoking and stopping smoking rates. We analyzed data for 16,523 children aged 0–11 years from a pediatric computer decision support system (Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation [CHICA]). CHICA asks families in the waiting room about household smokers. We examined associations between race, insurance, language preference, and household smoking and reported stopping smoking rates using logistic regression. Almost a quarter (23%) of the children's families reported a smoker at home. Hispanic children are least likely (odds ratio [OR]: 0.17, confidence interval [CI]: 0.12–0.24) to have secondhand smoke exposure when compared to African American and white children, as were those with private insurance (OR: 0.52, CI: 0.43–0.64) or no insurance (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.71–0.88) compared to publicly insured. Children from English speaking families were more likely (OR: 1.55, CI: 1.24–1.95) to have secondhand smoke exposure compared to Spanish speaking families. Among smoking families, 30% reported stopping smoking subsequently. Stopping rates were higher in Hispanic (OR: 3.25, CI: 2.06–5.13) and African American (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.01–1.91) families compared to white children's families. Uninsured families were less likely than publicly insured families to report stopping smoking (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.63–0.92). English speaking families were less likely (OR: 0.56, CI: 0.41–0.75) to report stopping smoking compared to Spanish speaking even in a subgroup analyses of Hispanic families (OR: 0.55, CI: 0.39–0.76). In our safety net practices serving children predominantly on public insurance, Spanish speaking families reported the lowest risk of secondhand smoke exposure in children and the highest rate of stopping smoking in the household. Hispanic families may have increasing secondhand exposure and decreasing rates of stopping smoking as they acculturate.

AB  - The Meaningful Use (MU) program has increased the national emphasis on electronic measurement of hospital quality.To evaluate stroke MU and one VHA stroke electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) in national VHA data and determine sources of error in using centralized electronic health record (EHR) data.Our study is a retrospective cross-sectional study of stroke quality measure eCQMs vs. chart review in a national EHR. We developed local SQL algorithms to generate the eCQMs, then modified them to run on VHA Central Data Warehouse (CDW) data. eCQM results were generated from CDW data in 2130 ischemic stroke admissions in 11 VHA hospitals. Local and CDW results were compared to chart review.We calculated the raw proportion of matching cases, sensitivity/specificity, and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for the numerators and denominators of each eCQM. To assess overall agreement for each eCQM, we calculated a weighted kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa statistic for a three-level outcome: ineligible, eligible-passed, or eligible-failed.In five eCQMs, the proportion of matched cases between CDW and chart ranged from 95.4 %-99.7 % (denominators) and 87.7 %-97.9 % (numerators). PPVs tended to be higher (range 96.8 %-100 % in CDW) with NPVs less stable and lower. Prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappas for overall agreement ranged from 0.73-0.95. Common errors included difficulty in identifying: (1) mechanical VTE prophylaxis devices, (2) hospice and other specific discharge disposition, and (3) contraindications to receiving care processes.Stroke MU indicators can be relatively accurately generated from existing EHR systems (nearly 90 % match to chart review), but accuracy decreases slightly in central compared to local data sources. To improve stroke MU measure accuracy, EHRs should include standardized data elements for devices, discharge disposition (including hospice and comfort care status), and recording contraindications.

AB  - We examined whether pain outcomes (pain interference, perceived pain treatment effectiveness) vary by race and then whether opioid use moderates these associations. These analyses are part of a retrospective cohort study among 3,505 black and 46,203 non-Hispanic, white Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with diagnoses of chronic musculoskeletal pain who responded to the 2007 VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP). We used electronic medical record data to identify prescriptions for pharmacologic pain treatments in the year after diagnosis (Pain Diagnosis index visit) and before the SHEP index visit (the visit that made one eligible to complete the SHEP); pain outcomes came from the SHEP. We found no significant associations between race and pain interference or perceived effectiveness of pain treatment. VA patients with opioid prescriptions between the Pain Diagnosis index visit and the SHEP index visit reported greater pain interference on the SHEP than those without opioid prescriptions during that period. Opioid prescriptions were not associated with perceived treatment effectiveness for most patients. Findings raise questions about benefits of opioids for musculoskeletal pain and point to the need for alternative treatments for addressing chronic noncancer pain.

Looking beyond traditional medical school and graduate school pathways into the field is crucial for expanding the number of individuals and increasing diversity in the field. This case report provides an overview of the development and initial implementation of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) High School Scholars Program. Initiated in 2014, the program's primary goal was to provide dissemination opportunities for high school students engaged in biomedical informatics research. We discuss success factors including strong cross-institutional, cross-organizational collaboration and the high quality of high school student submissions to the program. The challenges encountered, especially around working with minors and communicating program expectations clearly, are also discussed. Finally, we present the path forward for the continued evolution of the AMIA High School Scholars Program.

AB  - Commencing in 2017, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 will change how Medicare pays health professionals. By enacting MACRA, Congress brought an end to the (un)sustainable growth rate formula while also setting forth a vision for how to transform the U.S. healthcare system so that clinicians deliver higher-quality care with smarter spending by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In October 2016, CMS released the first of what stakeholders anticipate will be a number of (annual) rules related to implementation of MACRA. CMS received extensive input from stakeholders including the American Geriatrics Society. Under the Quality Payment Program, CMS streamlined multiple Medicare value-based payment programs into a new Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). CMS also outlined how it will provide incentives for participation in Advanced Alternative Payment Models (called APMs). Although Medicare payments to geriatrics health professionals will not be based on the new MIPS formula until 2019, those payments will be based upon performance during a 90-day period in 2017. This article defines geriatrics health professionals as clinicians who care for a predominantly older adult population and who are eligible to bill under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Given the current paucity of eligible APMs, this article will focus on MIPS while providing a brief overview of APMs.

Fairbanks School of Public Health, 4Regenstrief Institute, Inc., 5Department of Kinesiology, Indiana University School of Physical Education and Tourism Management, 6Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA Background: Resistance exercise is effective to increase muscle strength for older adults; however, its effect on the outcome of activities of daily living is often limited. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 3-Step Workout for Life (which combines resistance exercise, functional exercise, and activities of daily living exercise) would be more beneficial than resistance exercise alone. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. Fifty-two inactive, community-dwelling older adults (mean age =73 years) with muscle weakness and difficulty in activities of daily living were randomized to receive 3-Step Workout for Life or resistance exercise only. Participants in the 3-Step Workout for Life Group performed functional movements and selected activities of daily living at home in addition to resistance exercise. Participants in the Resistance Exercise Only Group performed resistance exercise only. Both groups were comparable in exercise intensity (moderate), duration (50–60 minutes each time for 10 weeks), and frequency (three times a week). Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, a standard performance test on activities of daily living, was administered at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months after intervention completion.Results: At postintervention, the 3-Step Workout for Life Group showed improvement on the outcome measure (mean change from baseline =0.29, P=0.02), but the improvement was not greater than the Resistance Exercise Only Group (group mean difference =0.24, P=0.13). However, the Resistance Exercise Only Group showed a significant decline (mean change from baseline =–0.25, P=0.01) 6 months after the intervention completion. Meanwhile, the superior effect of 3-Step Workout for Life was observed (group mean difference =0.37, P

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD), part of a larger spectrum of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, affects up to 15% of women following the birth of an infant. Fathers may also be affected. PPD not only affects caregivers, but also impacts infants through mechanisms such as inadequate caregiver–infant interactions and non-adherence to safety practices. The negative impact on infants may extend across the life course through adulthood. This article seeks to move the needle toward universal screening for PPD using validated tools in pediatric primary care settings for new caregivers by making the legal and ethical case for this course of action in a manner that is both compelling and accessible for clinicians. Toward this end, we summarize current literature as it applies to provider responsibilities, liabilities and perspectives; and caregiver autonomy, confidentiality, and privacy. We then assess utility by balancing the benefits and burdens of this approach to practices, providers, and caregivers; and take the analysis one step further by looking across multiple populations to assess distributive justice. We conclude that there is a strong ethical case for universal screening for PPD in pediatric primary care settings using validated tools when informed consent can be obtained and appropriate follow-up services are available and accessible. Clinical considerations, practical resources, and areas ripe for future research are also addressed.

AB  - Background: Without advanced preparation of legal documents, state law determines who may serve as a surrogate decision maker for patients in hospitals. Objectives: To examine the relationship characteristics associated with traditional versus nontraditional health care surrogates who are making medical decisions for patients in hospitals. Research Design: Secondary analysis of a baseline cross-sectional survey of a larger prospective observational study. Subjects: In total, 364 patient/surrogate dyads consisting of patients aged 65 years and older admitted to the medical or medical intensive care unit services who lacked decision-making capacity based on a physician assessment and also had a surrogate available. Results: This study of surrogate decision makers for hospitalized older adults found that the relationships of nontraditional surrogates such as, nieces, nephews, and friends serving in the surrogate role is nearly identical to those of traditional, first degree relatives serving as a surrogate. Over two-thirds (71.2%) of nontraditional surrogates saw the patient in-person at least weekly compared with 80.8% of legal surrogates ( P -value, 0.9023). Almost all traditional and nontraditional surrogates discussed the patient’s medical preferences with the patient (96.9% of legal surrogates and 89.2% of nontraditional surrogates; P =0.0510). Conclusions: This study shows that both traditional and nontraditional surrogates, who are a patient’s primary care giver have similar relationships with patients. The findings of this study suggest that requiring family members such as grandchildren to take the extra step of formal appointment through a legal channel may not be necessary to protect patients. Therefore, broader state laws expanding the list of surrogates authorized by state statute to include more nontraditional surrogates may be necessary.

AB  - Results of a study to estimate the prevalence and severity of delays in wireless updates of smart-pump drug libraries across a large group of U.S. hospitals are reported. A prolonged smart-pump drug library update may result in patient harm if a pump is programmed with an incorrect limit setting at the time of drug administration. A retrospective study was conducted using smart-pump alert data extracted from the Regenstrief National Center for Medical Device Informatics (REMEDI) database. The study sample consisted of 49 hospitals in 5 states across the Midwest and Kentucky operated by 12 health systems; all the facilities used a specific brand of smart pump (BD Alaris, Beckton, Dickinson and Company) capable of generating alert data and had consistently contributed alert data to the REMEDI database over a 2-year period. An update delay was defined as the interval from the time a drug library version was replaced to the time of the last infusion alert triggered by the previous version during the study period. Of the 12 health systems, 11 were found to have had drug library update delays during the study period, with delay medians ranging from 22 to 192 days. The overall delay minimum and maximum durations were 0 and 661 days. Substantial delays in completion of wireless updates of smart-pump drug libraries were common across a group of hospitals of various sizes.

AB  - Evaluate narratives aimed at motivating providers with different pre-existing beliefs to address racial healthcare disparities. Survey experiment with 280 providers. Providers were classified as high or low in attributing disparities to providers (HPA versus LPA) and were randomly assigned to a non-narrative control or 1 of 2 narratives: “Provider Success” (provider successfully resolved problem involving Black patient) and “Provider Bias” (Black patient experienced racial bias, which remained unresolved). Participants' reactions to narratives (including identification with narrative) and likelihood of participating in disparities-reduction activities were immediately assessed. Four weeks later, participation in those activities was assessed, including self-reported participation in a disparities-reduction training course (primary outcome). Participation in training was higher among providers randomized to the Provider Success narrative compared to Provider Bias or Control. LPA participants had higher identification with Provider Success than Provider Bias narratives, whereas among HPA participants, differences in identification between the narratives were not significant. Provider Success narratives led to greater participation in training than Provider Bias narratives, although providers’ pre-existing beliefs influenced the narrative they identified with. Provider Success narratives may be more effective at motivating providers to address disparities than Provider Bias narratives, though more research is needed.

AB  - Objective: Guidelines recommend that decision aids provide quantitative information about risks and benefits of available options. Impact of providing this information is unknown. Methods: Randomized trial comparing two decision aids about colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT). 688 primary care patients due for CRC screening viewed a decision aid that uses words only (Verbal arm) vs. one that provides quantitative information (Quantitative arm). Main outcomes included perceived CRC risk, intent to be screened, and test preference, measured before and after viewing decision aid, and screening uptake at six months. Analyses were performed with ANCOVA and logistic regression. Results: Compared to the Verbal arm, those in the Quantitative arm had a larger increase in intent to undergo FIT (p = 0.011) and were more likely to switch their preferred test from non-FIT to FIT (28% vs. 19%, p = .010). There were decreases in perceived risk in the Verbal Arm but not the Quantitative Arm (p = 0.004). There was no difference in screening uptake. Numeracy did not moderate any effects. Conclusions: Quantitative information had relatively minor impact and no clearly negative effects, such as reducing uptake. Practice implications: Quantitative information may be useful but not essential for patients viewing decision aids.

AB  - Abstract The Indian Health Service provides care to remote and under-resourced communities in the United States. American Indian/Alaska Native patients have some of the highest morbidity and mortality among any ethnic group in the United States. Starting in the 1980s, the IHS implemented the Resource and Patient Management System health information technology (HIT) platform to improve efficiency and quality to address these disparities. The IHS is currently assessing the Resource and Patient Management System to ensure that changing health information needs are met. HIT assessments have traditionally focused on cost, reimbursement opportunities, infrastructure, required or desired functionality, and the ability to meet provider needs. Little information exists on frameworks that assess HIT legacy systems to determine solutions for an integrated rural healthcare system whose end goal is health equity. This search for a next-generation HIT solution for a historically underserved population presents a unique opportunity to envision and redefine HIT that supports health equity as its core mission.

AB  - ContextNursing facility residents and their families may identify “comfort measures” as their overall goal of care, yet some hospital transfers still occur.ObjectivesDescribe nursing facility residents with comfort measures and their hospital transfers.MethodsMixed methods, including root cause analyses of transfers by registered nurses and interviews with a subset of health care providers and family members involved in transfers. Participants were residents in 19 central Indiana facilities with comfort measures orders who experienced unplanned transfers to the hospital between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Project demographic and clinical characteristics of the residents were obtained from the Minimum Data Set 3.0. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders involved in transfer decisions. Participants were prompted to reflect on reasons for the transfer and outcomes. Interviews were transcribed and coded using qualitative descriptive methods.ResultsResidents with comfort measures orders (n = 177) experienced 204 transfers. Most events were assessed as unavoidable (77%). Communication among staff, or between staff and the resident/family, primary care provider, or hospital was the most frequently noted area needing improvement (59.5%). In interviews, participants (n = 11) highlighted multiple issues, including judgments about whether decisions were “good” or “bad,” and factors that were important to decision-making, including communication, nursing facility capabilities, clinical situation, and goals of care.ConclusionMost transfers of residents with comfort measures orders were considered unavoidable. Nonetheless, we identified several opportunities for improving care processes, including communication and addressing acute changes in status.

AB  - Medication therapy management (MTM) is a service, most commonly provided by pharmacists, intended to identify and resolve medication therapy problems (MTPs) to enhance patient care. MTM is typically documented by the community pharmacist in an MTM vendor's web-based platform. These platforms often include integrated alerts to assist the pharmacist with assessing MTPs. In order to maximize the usability and usefulness of alerts to the end users (e.g., community pharmacists), MTM alert design should follow principles from human factors science. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the extent to which alerts for community pharmacist-delivered MTM align with established human factors principles, and 2) identify areas of opportunity and recommendations to improve MTM alert design.Five categories of MTM alerts submitted by community pharmacists were evaluated: 1) indication, 2) effectiveness; 3) safety; 4) adherence; and 5) cost-containment. This heuristic evaluation was guided by the Instrument for Evaluating Human-Factors Principles in Medication-Related Decision Support Alerts (I-MeDeSA) which we adapted and contained 32 heuristics. For each MTM alert, four analysts' individual ratings were summed and a mean score on the modified I-MeDeSA computed. For each heuristic, we also computed the percent of analyst ratings indicating alignment with the heuristic. We did this for all alerts evaluated to produce an "overall" summary of analysts' ratings for a given heuristic, and we also computed this separately for each alert category. Our results focus on heuristics where ≤50% of analysts' ratings indicated the alerts aligned with the heuristic.I-MeDeSA scores across the five alert categories were similar. Heuristics pertaining to visibility and color were generally met. Opportunities for improvement across all MTM alert categories pertained to the principles of alert prioritization; text-based information; alarm philosophy; and corrective actions.MTM alerts have several opportunities for improvement related to human factors principles, resulting in MTM alert design recommendations. Enhancements to MTM alert design may increase the effectiveness of MTM delivery by community pharmacists and result in improved patient outcomes.

AB  - The Remission Evaluation and Mood Inventory Tool (REMIT) was developed as a brief complementary measure to provide a more robust assessment of depression improvement than tracking DSM-V symptom improvement alone. This study provides further validation of the REMIT tool and examines its utility in predicting depression improvement. The sample comprised 294 primary care patients enrolled in a telecare trial of pain plus depression and/or anxiety. Assessments collected included: REMIT, PHQ-9 and measures assessing anxiety, pain, sleep, fatigue, somatization, health-related quality of life and disability. Data was analyzed to assess the REMIT's validity, its minimally important difference (MID), and its utility in predicting 6-month depression improvement. Convergent and construct validity of REMIT was supported by moderate correlations with mental health measures and weaker correlation with physical health measures. MID of approximately 2 points for REMIT was estimated by two metrics: 0.5 standard deviation and 1 standard error of measurement. Both baseline and 3-month change in REMIT scores predicted depression improvement at 6 months. Indeed, REMIT was as good or better predictor than the PHQ-9. The REMIT measure is a brief 5-item tool that augments core DSM-V symptom-oriented metrics in assessing and predicting recovery from major depression.

AB  - The stepped-wedge design for pragmatic clinical trials has received increased attention in health service-related research seeking to evaluate the effect of interventions. Compared with the parallel design, the stepped-wedge design is preferred when there is prior knowledge supporting the effectiveness and harmlessness of the intervention, and/or when practical or financial constraints exist such that the intervention can only be implemented sequentially on a fraction of clusters. In some health service studies, the study period may consist of two parts: an active implementation followed by a sustainability phase, where the intervention effect is possibly reduced. There is a gap in current literature of the stepped-wedge design for cluster randomization trials for dealing with this specific scenario. We aim to provide an analytical formula for power analysis under this situation to aid the stepped-wedge design of an ongoing PREVENT trial.

AB  - Background. Developing efficient procedures of model calibration, which entails matching model predictions to observed outcomes, has gained increasing attention. With faithful but complex simulation models established for cancer diseases, key parameters of cancer natural history can be investigated for possible fits, which can subsequently inform optimal prevention and treatment strategies. When multiple calibration targets exist, one approach to identifying optimal parameters relies on the Pareto frontier. However, computational burdens associated with higher-dimensional parameter spaces require a metamodeling approach. The goal of this work is to explore multiobjective calibration using Gaussian process regression (GPR) with an eye toward how multiple goodness-of-fit (GOF) criteria identify Pareto-optimal parameters. Methods. We applied GPR, a metamodeling technique, to estimate colorectal cancer (CRC)-related prevalence rates simulated from a microsimulation model of CRC natural history, known as the Colon Modeling Open Source Tool (CMOST). We embedded GPR metamodels within a Pareto optimization framework to identify best-fitting parameters for age-, adenoma-, and adenoma staging-dependent transition probabilities and risk factors. The Pareto frontier approach is demonstrated using genetic algorithms with both sum-of-squared errors (SSEs) and Poisson deviance GOF criteria. Results. The GPR metamodel is able to approximate CMOST outputs accurately on 2 separate parameter sets. Both GOF criteria are able to identify different best-fitting parameter sets on the Pareto frontier. The SSE criterion emphasizes the importance of age-specific adenoma progression parameters, while the Poisson criterion prioritizes adenoma-specific progression parameters. Conclusion. Different GOF criteria assert different components of the CRC natural history. The combination of multiobjective optimization and nonparametric regression, along with diverse GOF criteria, can advance the calibration process by identifying optimal regions of the underlying parameter landscape.

AB  - Purpose: Providers' beliefs about the causes of disparities and the entities responsible for addressing these disparities are important in designing disparity-reduction interventions aimed at providers. This secondary analysis of a larger study is aimed at evaluating perceptions of providers regarding the underlying causes of racial health care disparities and their views of who is responsible for reducing them. Methods: We surveyed 232 providers at 3 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. Results: Sixty-nine percent of participants believed that minority patients in the United States receive lower quality health care. Most participants (64%) attributed differences in quality of care for minority patients in the VA health care system primarily to patients' socioeconomic status, followed by patient behavior (43%) and provider behaviors (33%). In contrast, most participants believed that the VA and other health care organizations (75%) and providers (70%) bear the responsibility for reducing disparities, while less than half (45%) believed that patients were responsible. Among provider-level contributors to disparities, providers' poor communication was the most widely endorsed (48%), while differences in prescribing of medications (13%) and in provision of specialty referrals (12%) were the least endorsed. Conclusions: Although most providers in the study did not believe that providers contribute to disparities, they do believe that they, along with health care organizations, have the responsibility to help reduce them. Interventions might focus on directly offering providers concrete ways that they can help reduce disparities, rather than focusing on simply raising awareness about disparities and their contributions to them.

AB  - Patient portals present the opportunity to expand patients’ access to their clinicians and health information. Yet patients and clinicians have expressed the need for more guidance on portal and secure messaging procedures to avoid misuse. Little information is currently available concerning whether and how expectations of portal and messaging usage are communicated to patients. To identify the information made available to patients about patient portal use, and to assess ease in accessing such information. A national survey of publicly available portal information from hospital websites. The study team followed up with phone calls to each hospital to request any additional patient-directed materials (e.g., pamphlets) not located in the web search. A random sample of 200 acute-care hospitals, 50 from each of four US Census regions, selected from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Hospital Compare dataset. Availability of patient portals, secure messaging, and related functionality; the content and ease of access to patient-directed information about portals. Of the hospitals sampled, 177 (89%) had a patient portal; 116 (66%) of these included secure messaging functionality. Most portals with secure messaging (N = 65, 58%) did not describe appropriate patient messaging conduct. Although many included disclaimers that the service is not for emergencies, 23 hospitals only included this within the fine prints of their “Terms and Conditions” section. Content analysis of additional patient-directed materials revealed a focus on logistical content, features of the portals, and parameters of use. Of the three categories, logistical content (e.g., creating an account) was the most thorough. Although most of the sampled hospitals had patient portals, many fail to educate patients fully and set expectations for secure messaging. To improve patient engagement and minimize harm, hospitals and clinicians need to provide more information and set clearer guidelines for patients.

AB  - Background. Safe opioid prescribing and effective pain care are particularly important issues in the United States, where decades of widespread opioid prescribing have contributed to high rates of opioid use disorder. Because of the importance of clinician-patient communication in effective pain care and recent initiatives to curb rising opioid overdose deaths, this study sought to understand how clinicians and patients communicate about the risks, benefits, and goals of opioid therapy during primary care visits. Methods. We recruited clinicians and patients from six primary care clinics across three health systems in the Midwest United States. We audio-recorded 30 unique patients currently receiving opioids for chronic noncancer pain from 12 clinicians. We systematically analyzed transcribed, clinic visits to identify emergent themes. Results. Twenty of the 30 patient participants were females. Several patients had multiple pain diagnoses, with the most common diagnoses being osteoarthritis ( n = 10), spondylosis ( n = 6), and low back pain ( n = 5). We identified five themes: 1) communication about individual-level and population-level risks, 2) communication about policies or clinical guidelines related to opioids, 3) communication about the limited effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain conditions, 4) communication about nonopioid therapies for chronic pain, and 5) communication about the goal of the opioid tapering. Conclusions. Clinicians discuss opioid-related risks in varying ways during patient visits, which may differentially affect patient experiences. Our findings may inform the development and use of more standardized approaches to discussing opioids during primary care visits.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of significant, unmet palliative care needs in nursing facilities, yet limitations in the workforce limit access to palliative care services. Attention to palliation is particularly important when there are efforts to reduce hospitalizations to help ensure there are no unintended harms associated with treating residents in place. A specialized palliative care registered nurse (PCRN) role was developed as part of the OPTIMISTIC (Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care) program, a federally funded project to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Working in collaboration with existing clinical staff and medical providers, the PCRN focuses on managing symptoms, advance care planning, achieving goal concordant care, and promoting quality of life. The PCRN serves as a resource for families through education and support. The PCRN also provides education and mentorship to staff to increase their comfort, knowledge, and skills with end-of-life care. The goals of this article are to provide an overview of the PCRN role and its implementation in nursing facilities and describe core functions that are transferrable to other contexts.

AB  - Abstract Background Given the vast range of molecular mechanisms giving rise to breast cancer, it is unlikely universal cures exist. However, by providing a more precise prognosis for breast cancer patients through integrative models, treatments can become more individualized, resulting in more successful outcomes. Specifically, we combine gene expression, pseudogene expression, miRNA expression, clinical factors, and pseudogene-gene functional networks to generate these models for breast cancer prognostics. Establishing a LASSO-generated molecular gene signature revealed that the increased expression of genes STXBP5, GALP and LOC387646 indicate a poor prognosis for a breast cancer patient. We also found that increased CTSLP8 and RPS10P20 and decreased HLA-K pseudogene expression indicate poor prognosis for a patient. Perhaps most importantly we identified a pseudogene-gene interaction, GPS2-GPS2P1 (improved prognosis) that is prognostic where neither the gene nor pseudogene alone is prognostic of survival. Besides, miR-3923 was predicted to target GPS2 using miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan, which imply modules of gene-pseudogene-miRNAs that are potentially functionally related to patient survival. Results In our LASSO-based model, we take into account features including pseudogenes, genes and candidate pseudogene-gene interactions. Key biomarkers were identified from the features. The identification of key biomarkers in combination with significant clinical factors (such as stage and radiation therapy status) should be considered as well, enabling a specific prognostic prediction and future treatment plan for an individual patient. Here we used our PseudoFuN web application to identify the candidate pseudogene-gene interactions as candidate features in our integrative models. We further identified potential miRNAs targeting those features in our models using PseudoFuN as well. From this study, we present an interpretable survival model based on LASSO and decision trees, we also provide a novel feature set which includes pseudogene-gene interaction terms that have been ignored by previous prognostic models. We find that some interaction terms for pseudogenes and genes are significantly prognostic of survival. These interactions are cross-over interactions, where the impact of the gene expression on survival changes with pseudogene expression and vice versa. These may imply more complicated regulation mechanisms than previously understood. Conclusions We recommend these novel feature sets be considered when training other types of prognostic models as well, which may provide more comprehensive insights into personalized treatment decisions.

AB  - Objective Outbreak detection and disease control may be improved by simplified, semi-automated reporting of notifiable diseases to public health authorities. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an electronic, prepopulated notifiable disease report form on case reporting rates by ambulatory care clinics to public health authorities. Methods We conducted a 2-year (2012-2014) controlled before-and-after trial of a health information exchange (HIE) intervention in Indiana designed to prepopulate notifiable disease reporting forms to providers. We analyzed data collected from electronic prepopulated reports and “usual care” (paper, fax) reports submitted to a local health department for 7 conditions by using a difference-in-differences model. Primary outcomes were changes in reporting rates, completeness, and timeliness between intervention and control clinics. Results Provider reporting rates for chlamydia and gonorrhea in intervention clinics increased significantly from 56.9% and 55.6%, respectively, during the baseline period (2012) to 66.4% and 58.3%, respectively, during the intervention period (2013-2014); they decreased from 28.8% and 27.5%, respectively, to 21.7% and 20.6%, respectively, in control clinics ( P &lt; .001). Completeness improved from baseline to intervention for 4 of 15 fields in reports from intervention clinics ( P &lt; .001), although mean completeness improved for 11 fields in both intervention and control clinics. Timeliness improved for both intervention and control clinics; however, reports from control clinics were timelier (mean, 7.9 days) than reports from intervention clinics (mean, 9.7 days). Conclusions Electronic, prepopulated case reporting forms integrated into providers’ workflow, enabled by an HIE network, can be effective in increasing notifiable disease reporting rates and completeness of information. However, it was difficult to assess the effect of using the forms for diseases with low prevalence (eg, salmonellosis, histoplasmosis).

AB  - Many communities in the United States are struggling to deal with the negative consequences of illicit opioid use. Effectively addressing this epidemic requires the coordination and support of community stakeholders in a change process with common goals and objectives, continuous engagement with individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) through their treatment and recovery journeys, application of systems engineering principles to drive process change and sustain it, and use of a formal evaluation process to support a learning community that continuously adapts. This review presents strategies to improve OUD treatment and recovery with a focus on engineering approaches grounded in systems thinking.

AB  - Sixteen million caregivers currently provide care to more than 5 million persons living with dementia (PLWD) in the United States. Although this population is growing and highly complex, evidence‐based management remains poorly integrated within healthcare systems. Therefore, the National Institute on Aging IMPACT Collaboratory was formed to build the nation's ability to conduct embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) for PLWD and their caregivers. The pilot core of the IMPACT Collaboratory seeks to provide funds for upward of 40 pilots for ePCTs to accelerate the testing of nonpharmacologic interventions with the goal that these pilots lead to full‐scale ePCTs and eventually the embedding of evidence‐based care into healthcare systems. The first two challenges for the pilot core in building the pilot study program were (1) to develop a transparent, ethical, and open nationwide process for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting pilot studies; and (2) to begin the process of describing the necessary components of a pilot study for an ePCT. During our initial funding cycle, we received 35 letters of intent, of which 17 were accepted for a full proposal and 14 were submitted. From this process we learned that investigators lack knowledge in ePCTs, many interventions lack readiness for an ePCT pilot study, and many proposed studies lack key pragmatic design elements. We therefore have set three key criteria that future pilot studies must meet at a minimum to be considered viable. We additionally discuss key design decisions investigators should consider in designing a pilot study for an ePCT. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:S14–S20, 2020 .

AB  - Abstract Background It is estimated that 55 million adults will be 65 years and older in the USA by 2020. These older adults are at increased risk for injury and their recovery is multi-faceted. A collaborative care model may improve psychological and functional outcomes of the non-neurologically impaired older trauma patient and reduce health care costs. Methods This is a randomized controlled trial of 430 patients aged 50 and older who have suffered a non-neurologic injury and are admitted to a level one trauma center in Indianapolis, IN, or Madison, WI. Participants will be assigned to either the Trauma Medical Home (TMH) intervention or usual care. The TMH intervention is a collaborative care model that includes validated protocols addressing the multi-faceted needs of this population, with the help of care coordination software and a mobile office concept. The primary outcome is self-reported physical recovery at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include self-reported psychological recovery, acute health care utilization, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention at 6 and 12 months. The TMH collaborative care model will be delivered by a registered nurse care coordinator. The assessments will be completed by trained blinded research assistants. Discussion The proposed study will evaluate a collaborative care model to help maximize psychological and functional recovery for non-neurologically injured older patients at four level one trauma centers in the Midwest.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a growing public health problem in the United States. Implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices reduce mortality and morbidity, and remote monitoring (RM) of these devices improves outcomes. However, patient RM adherence is low, due in part to lack of access to their RM data. Providing these data to patients may increase engagement, but they must be appropriately tailored to ensure understanding.The purpose of this study was to examine patients' experiences interacting with their RM data through a novel digital dashboard as part of daily life.In this mixed-methods pilot study, 10 patients with implantable CRT defibrillators were given access to a patient-centered RM data dashboard, updated daily for 6-12 months. Pre- and post-health literacy, engagement, electronic portal (MyChart, Epic Systems Corporation) logins, and RM adherence were measured; system usability scores were collected at exit; and dashboard views were tracked. Exit interviews were conducted to elucidate patients' experiences.Participants (100% white; 60% male; age 34-80 years [mean ± SD: 62.0 ± 13.4]) had adequate health literacy, increased MyChart logins (P = .0463), and nonsignificant increase in RM adherence. Participants viewed their dashboards 0-42 times (mean 14.9 ± 12.5). Interviews revealed participants generally appreciated access to their data, understood it, and responded to changes; however, questions and concerns remained regarding data interpretation and visualization.Preliminary findings support potential future integration of a CRT RM data dashboard in the daily care of HF patients. With appropriate informational support and personalization, sharing RM data with patients in a tailored dashboard may improve health engagement.

Nationally, NH staff will continue to be regularly tested for COVID-19, yet we know little about the staff perspective on testing. We surveyed NH staff following Indiana's statewide testing effort to assess attitudes and beliefs about mandatory COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Testing occurred June 1 to 30, 2020. Facilities either had ISDH staff test on-site or kits were distributed to test staff within 24 hours. Samples were collected via nasopharyngeal or interior nares swabs for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based COVID-19 test. A total of 47,277 staff registered for testing and 28% had unique e-mail addresses. After excluding staff aged <18 years, 18,802 staff formed the sampling frame. A geographically diverse random sample of 4296 were invited to complete a 19-item online questionnaire developed by the investigators. The study was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Overall, 242 (5.6%) staff responded to the survey. Respondent demographics and responses to key questions are in Table 1. Most (n = 167, 69.0%) had no concerns about regular COVID-19 testing and believed testing was “easy” (n = 148, 61.2%), although 50.4% (n = 122) noted testing was “uncomfortable.” Potential barriers to ongoing testing if done outside the workplace included time (n = 135, 55.8%) and cost (n = 106, 43.8%). Among respondents who did not see the importance of regular testing (n = 54, 22.3%), free-text answers anecdotally suggested belief that testing asymptomatic staff has little value if staff are correctly following infection protocols. Many staff have concerns about vaccines, with 26.5% (n = 64) stating they would wait to be vaccinated, 17.8% (n = 43) unsure of whether they will agree to vaccination once available, and 12.4% (n = 30) will refuse vaccination outright.Table 1Nursing Home Staff Demographics, Attitudes, and Experiences With COVID-19 TestingOverall (N = 242)Clinical staff∗Includes certified nursing assistants, registered nurses, physical/occupational/speech therapists, licensed practical nurses, and physician assistants.

Notably, 29.6% (n = 8) of administrators noted ongoing testing was not important compared with 21.6% (n = 24) of clinical staff. Any division between staff and administrators could result in testing noncompliance, and failure to identify asymptomatic staff could have significant consequences for residents.7Hatfield K.M. Reddy S.C. Forsberg K. et al.Facility-wide testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes - seven U.S. jurisdictions, March-June 2020.MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020; 69: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Coupling education with mandatory staff testing as a condition of employment and in-facility, less-invasive testing methods (ie, nasal swabs or salvia vs nasopharyngeal swabs) may ensure compliance. Answers varied among staff positions with future vaccine uptake, 3.7% (n = 1) of administrators will not get vaccinated compared with 15.3% (n = 17) of clinical staff. As noted by our results, when a vaccine is available, assurances of safety and efficacy will be necessary for NH staff uptake.

Despite a low response rate, these data have value in understanding the experiences and attitudes of NH staff about COVID-19 testing, and potential vaccination. Federal and state officials and industry leaders have been grappling with the best approaches to ongoing testing during this pandemic, weighing likelihood of benefit with cost and supply issues. The attitudes and beliefs of staff, who provide the day-to-day care for NH residents, are key to understanding strategies required for successful implementation of ongoing testing programs.

AB  - The symptoms and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have yet to be determined, and evaluating possible early signs is critical to determine which patients should be tested and treated. The objective of this ongoing study is to evaluate initial and short-term rhinologic symptoms, olfactory ability, and general quality of life in patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing.Prospective case-control.Academic institute.Adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 were prospectively enrolled and separated into positive and negative groups. Each participant completed 4 validated patient-reported outcome measures. The UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) was distributed to patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive.The positive group reported significantly decreased sense of smell and taste on the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) as compared with the negative group (mean ± SD: 3.4 ± 1.7 vs 1.2 ± 1.4, P < .001). The positive group had a much higher probability of reporting a decrease in smell/taste as "severe" or "as bad as it can be" (63.3% vs 5.8%) with an odds ratio of 27.6 (95% CI, 5.9-128.8). There were no differences between groups for overall SNOT-22 domain scores, PHQ-4 depression/anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), and 5-Level EQ-5D quality-of-life scores. Mean Self-MOQ (Self-reported Mini Olfactory Questionnaire) scores were 7.0 ± 5.6 for the positive group and 1.8 ± 4.0 for the negative group (P < .001). The mean UPSIT score was 28.8 ± 7.2 in the positive group.Symptomatic patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive report severe olfactory and gustatory dysfunction via the Self-MOQ and SNOT-22 as compared with symptomatic patients testing negative.

AB  - Although clopidogrel is a frequently used antiplatelet medication to treat and prevent atherothrombotic disease, clinicians must balance its clinical effectiveness with the potential side effect of bleeding. However, many previous studies have evaluated beneficial and adverse factors separately. The objective of our study was to perform a comprehensive meta‐analysis of studies of clopidogrel’s clinical effectiveness and/or risk of bleeding in order to identify and assess all reported risk factors, thus helping clinicians to balance patient safety with drug efficacy. We analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of maintenance use in four stages: search for relevant primary articles; abstract and full article screening; quality assessment and data extraction; and synthesis and data analysis. Screening of 7,109 articles yielded 52 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty‐seven risk factors were identified. “Definite risk factors” were defined as those with aggregated odds ratios (ORs) &gt; 1 and confidence intervals (CIs) &gt; 1 if analyzed in more than one study. Definite risk factors for major bleeding were concomitant aspirin use (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.04–3.94) and long duration of clopidogrel therapy (&gt; 6 months) (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.21–2.50). Dual antiplatelet therapy, extended clopidogrel therapy, and high maintenance dose (150 mg/day) of clopidogrel were definite risk factors for any bleeding. Reduced renal function, both mild and severe, was the only definite risk factor for clinical ineffectiveness. These findings can help clinicians predict the risks and effectiveness of clopidogrel use for their patients and be used in clinical decision support tools.

AB  - Abstract Background Informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) manage a complex spectrum of patient behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Mobile health information technologies have quickly become sources for modern social support and chronic disease management. These technologies can improve our understanding of how to care for patients with ADRD and their informal caregivers. A mobile telehealth intervention could help reduce caregiver burden and BPSD. Methods This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of 60 dyads of patients living with ADRD and their caregivers, to test the feasibility and estimate the potential effect of the Brain CareNotes (BCN) mobile telehealth system. Participants will be recruited from two health systems. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the BCN intervention arm or usual care comparator. Data will be collected at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess feasibility outcomes: (a) recruitment rate, (b) data completion, (c) BCN usability, (d) BCN acceptance, and (e) BCN use and assessed either on an ongoing basis or at 3- and 6-month post-intervention. A secondary objective was to estimate the intervention’s effects on caregiver burden and patient BPSD outcomes at 3 and 6 months, assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Discussion The study will assess the intervention feasibility and potential effect size of the BCN telehealth system as a potentially scalable and lower-cost solution for addressing the ADRD public health crisis.

AB  - Every day, older adults living with heart failure make decisions regarding their health that may ultimately affect their disease trajectory. Experts describe these decisions as instances of naturalistic decision making influenced by the surrounding social and physical environment and involving shifting goals, high stakes, and the involvement of others.This study applied a naturalistic decision-making approach to better understand everyday decision making by older adults with heart failure.We present a cross-sectional qualitative field research study using a naturalistic decision-making conceptual model and critical incident technique to study health-related decision making. The study recruited 24 older adults with heart failure and 14 of their accompanying support persons from an ambulatory cardiology center. Critical incident interviews were performed and qualitatively analyzed to understand in depth how individuals made everyday health-related decisions.White, male (66.7%), older adults' decision making accorded with a preliminary conceptual model of naturalistic decision making occurring in phases of monitoring, interpreting, and acting, both independently and in sequence, for various decisions. Analyses also uncovered that there are barriers and strategies affecting the performance of these phases, other actors can play important roles, and health decisions are made in the context of personal priorities, values, and emotions.Study findings lead to an expanded conceptual model of naturalistic decision making by older adults with heart failure. In turn, the model bears implications for future research and the design of interventions grounded in the realities of everyday decision making.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the Regenstrief Teaching Electronic Medical Record (tEMR), how the tEMR could be used, and how it is currently being used in health professions education. The tEMR is a derivative of a real-world electronic health record (EHR), a large, pseudonymized patient database, and a population health tool designed to support curricular goals. The tEMR has been successfully adopted at 12 health professional, public health, and health information technology (HIT) schools, with over 11 800 unique student users and more than 74 000 logins, for case presentation, to develop diagnostic and therapeutic plans, and to practice documentation skills. With the exponential growth of health-related data and the impact of HIT on work-life balance, it is critical for students to get early EHR skills practice and understand how EHR’s work. The tEMR is a promising, scalable, flexible application to help health professional students learn about common HIT tools and issues.

AB  - To develop a conceptual model and novel, comprehensive framework that encompass the myriad ways informatics and technology can support public health response to a pandemic.The conceptual model and framework categorize informatics solutions that could be used by stakeholders (e.g., government, academic institutions, healthcare providers and payers, life science companies, employers, citizens) to address public health challenges across the prepare, respond, and recover phases of a pandemic, building on existing models for public health operations and response.Mapping existing solutions, technology assets, and ideas to the framework helped identify public health informatics solution requirements and gaps in responding to COVID-19 in areas such as applied science, epidemiology, communications, and business continuity. Two examples of technologies used in COVID-19 illustrate novel applications of informatics encompassed by the framework. First, we examine a hub from The Weather Channel, which provides COVID-19 data via interactive maps, trend graphs, and details on case data to individuals and businesses. Second, we examine IBM Watson Assistant for Citizens, an AI-powered virtual agent implemented by healthcare providers and payers, government agencies, and employers to provide information about COVID-19 via digital and telephone-based interaction.Early results from these novel informatics solutions have been positive, showing high levels of engagement and added value across stakeholders.The framework supports development, application, and evaluation of informatics approaches and technologies in support of public health preparedness, response, and recovery during a pandemic. Effective solutions are critical to success in recovery from COVID-19 and future pandemics.

AB  - Measurement-based care is an effective clinical strategy underutilized for bipolar disorder partly due to lacking a widely adopted patient-reported manic symptom measure. To report development and psychometric properties of a brief patient-reported manic symptom measure. Secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized effectiveness trial comparing two treatments for 1004 primary care patients screening positive for bipolar disorder and/or PTSD. Two analytic samples included 114 participants with varied diagnoses and test-retest data, and 179 participants with psychiatrist-diagnosed bipolar disorder who had two or more assessments with the nine-item Patient Mania Questionnaire-9 [PMQ-9]). Internal and test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change were assessed. Minimally important difference (MID) was estimated by standard error of measurement (SEM) and by standard deviation (SD) effect sizes. The PMQ-9 had high internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88) and test-retest reliability (0.85). Concurrent validity correlation with manic symptom measures was high for the Internal State Scale-Activation Subscale (0.70; p<0.0001), and lower for the Altman Mania Rating Scale (0.26; p=0.007). Longitudinally, PMQ-9 was completed at 1511 clinical encounters in 179 patients with bipolar disorder. Mean PMQ-9 score at first and last encounters was 14.5 (SD 6.5) and 10.1 (SD 7.0), a 27% decrease in mean score during treatment, suggesting sensitivity to change. A point estimate of the MID was approximately 3 points (range of 2–4). The PMQ-9 demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, internal consistency, and sensitivity to change and was widely used and acceptable to patients and clinicians in a pragmatic clinical trial. Combined with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measure of depressive symptoms this brief measure could inform measurement-based care for individuals with bipolar disorder in primary care and mental health care settings given its ease of administration and familiar self-report response format.

AB  - Abstract Efforts to reduce opioid-related harms have decreased opioid prescription but have provoked concerns about unintended consequences, particularly for long-term opioid therapy (LtOT) recipients. Research is needed to address the knowledge gap regarding how risk of substance-related morbidity changes across LtOT and its discontinuation. This study used nationwide commercial insurance claims data and a within-individual design to examine associations of LtOT dose and discontinuation with substance-related morbidity. We identified 194,839 adolescents and adults who initiated opioid prescription in 2010 to 2018 and subsequently received LtOT. The cohort was followed for a median of 965 days (interquartile range, 525-1550), of which a median of 176 days (119-332) were covered by opioid prescription. During follow-up, there were 17,582 acute substance-related morbidity events, defined as claims for emergency visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and ambulance transportation with substance use disorder or overdose diagnoses. Relative to initial treatment, risk was greater within individual during subsequent periods of &gt;60 to 120 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49) and &gt;120 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.24-1.76) daily morphine milligram equivalents. Risk was also greater during days 1 to 30 after discontinuations than during initial treatment (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35). However, it was no greater than during the 30 days before discontinuations, indicating that the risk may not be wholly attributable to discontinuation itself. Results were supported by a negative control pharmacotherapy analysis and additional sensitivity analyses. They suggest that LtOT recipients may experience increased substance-related morbidity risk during treatment subsequent to initial opioid prescription, particularly in periods involving higher doses.

AB  - Narrative clinical guidelines often contain assumptions, knowledge gaps, and ambiguities that make translation into an electronic computable format difficult. This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections.The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to generate FHIR implementation guides.Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes. Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind.Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include validation and, eventually, real-world application. The process for creating the data dictionary and for generating implementation guides should also be improved to prepare for this expanding work.This work was supported by the World Health Organization, which also worked as a collaborative partner throughout the study.

AB  - To compare associations between individual antidepressants and newborn outcomes.Retrospective cohort study.Deliveries in a large, US medical system.Women who received at least one antidepressant prescription 3 months prior to conception through delivery.Eligible women had maternal characteristics and newborn outcomes extracted from medical record data. Exposure was defined by the timing of the prescription during pregnancy.Newborn outcomes (any adaptation syndrome, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission) were analyzed for each antidepressant and compared using standard statistics and multivariable regression compared to exposure to bupropion. Odds of outcomes based on timing of exposure were also explored.A total of 3,694 women were analyzed. Rates of any adaptation syndrome (p < 0.001), NICU admission (p < 0.001), and transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) (p = 0.006) were significantly different between drugs. Infants exposed to duloxetine had the highest rates of NICU admissions (39.6%) and adaptation syndromes (15.1%). Venlafaxine-exposed infants had the highest rates of TTN (18.2%). Controlling for maternal age, race, insurance, and gestational age at delivery, early pregnancy antidepressant exposure was associated with adaptation syndrome and NICU admission for both duloxetine (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.31 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.11-4.80] and aOR 2.47 [95% CI 1.40-4.34], respectively) and escitalopram (aOR 1.72 [95% CI 1.09-2.70] and aOR 1.64 [95% CI 1.21-2.22], respectively). Exposure in the third trimester was associated with any adaptation syndrome for citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine and NICU admission for bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, and fluoxetine.Duloxetine and escitalopram appear to have the strongest associations with any adaptation syndrome and NICU admission whereas bupropion and sertraline tended to have among the lowest risks of these outcomes. These results can help providers and patients discuss choice of individual antidepressant drugs during pregnancy.

AB  - Background Delirium is among the most common complications following major surgery. Delirium following medical illness is associated with the development of chronic cognitive decline. The objective of this study was to determine the association of postoperative delirium with dementia in the year following surgery. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study in a large health network (January 2013 to December 2019). All patients over age 50 undergoing surgery requiring an inpatient stay were included. Our main exposure was an episode of delirium. The primary outcome was a new dementia diagnosis in the 1 y following discharge. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, non-home discharge destination, mortality and rehospitalizations in 1 y. Results There were 39,665 patients included, with a median age of 66. There were 4156 of 39,665 emergencies (10.5%). Specialties were general surgery (12,285/39,665, 31%) and orthopedics (11,503/39,665, 29%). There were 3327 (8.4%) patients with delirium. Delirious patients were older and were more likely to have comorbid conditions and undergone complex procedures. There were 1353 of 39,665 (3.5%) patients who developed dementia in the year following their surgery; 4930 of 39,665 (12.4%) who died; and 8200 of 39,665 (20.7%) who were readmitted. Delirium was associated with a new dementia diagnosis after adjusting for baseline characteristics (Odds ratio [OR] 13.9; 95% CI, 12.2-15.7). Similarly, delirium was also associated with 1 y mortality (OR 3.1; 95% CI 2.9-3.4) and readmission (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.7-2.0). Conclusions Postoperative delirium is the strongest factor associated with development of dementia in the year following a major operation. Strategies to prevent, identify, and treat delirium in the postoperative setting may improve long-term cognitive recovery.

AB  - For many patients with cancer, the frequency of surveillance after primary treatment depends on the risk for cancer recurrence or progression. Lack of risk-aligned surveillance means too many unnecessary surveillance procedures for low-risk patients and not enough for high-risk patients. Using bladder cancer as an example, we examined whether practice determinants differ between Department of Veterans Affairs sites where risk-aligned surveillance was more (risk-aligned sites) or less common (need improvement sites).We used our prior quantitative data to identify two risk-aligned sites and four need improvement sites. We performed semistructured interviews with 40 Veterans Affairs staff guided by the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases framework that were deductively coded. We integrated quantitative data (risk-aligned site v need improvement site) and qualitative data from interviews, cross-tabulating salient determinants by site type.There were 14 participants from risk-aligned sites and 26 participants from need improvement sites. Irrespective of site type, we found a lack of knowledge on guideline recommendations. Additional salient determinants at need improvement sites were a lack of resources ("the next available without overbooking is probably seven to eight weeks out") and an absence of routines to incorporate risk-aligned surveillance ("I have my own guidelines that I've been using for 35 years").Knowledge, resources, and lack of routines were salient barriers to risk-aligned bladder cancer surveillance. Implementation strategies addressing knowledge and resources can likely contribute to more risk-aligned surveillance. In addition, reminders for providers to incorporate risk into their surveillance plans may improve their routines.

AB  - Within this issue of JAMDA, there are multiple articles that describe barriers and facilitators to implementing and scaling evidence-based interventions in nursing homes (NHs). Together, these authors highlight many of the challenges that are universal to the implementation phase of the “Discovery-to-Delivery” translational cycle, as well as several that are unique to the NH setting. Mills and colleagues elicited feedback from NH staff regarding perceived barriers and facilitators for implementing evidence-based strategies to improve interactions between staff and residents; respondents indicated that in addition to limitations in staffing and resources, a lack of facility-wide understanding of the project's goals was a common challenge to the success of any evidence-based implementation effort. 1 Mills W.L. Pimentel C. Snow A.L. et al. Nursing home staff perceptions to barriers and facilitators to implementing a quality improvement intervention. J Am Med Dir Assoc. 2019; 20: 810-815 Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar The authors also noted that interventions with “bite-sized” steps helped make participation feasible, and that reinforcing desired behavior increased the likelihood of success. The barriers and facilitators identified by Mills et al highlight how characteristics of individual health care professionals (such as their level of understanding and their desired behaviors) serve as key components for either the success or failure of implementation—as these are listed by respondents alongside other major challenges related to time, staffing, and resources.

AB  - The aim of the study is to assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) class and Medicare claims among young-old (65-69), old (70-74), and old-old (75+) adults over a 10-year period.We assessed costs by BMI class and age group among 9,300 respondents to the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with linked 1998-2008 Medicare claims data. BMI was classified as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), mild obesity (30-34.9), or severe obesity (35 or above).Annualized total Medicare claims adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and smoking history were 109% greater for severely obese young-old adults in comparison with normal weight young-old adults (US$9,751 vs. US$4,663). Total annualized claim differences between the normal weight and severely obese in the old and old-old groups were not statistically significant.Excess Medicare expenditures related to obesity may be concentrated among severely obese young-old adults. Preventing severe obesity among middle and older aged adults may have large cost implications for society.

AB  - Appreciative Inquiry is an organizational change methodology that discovers what works well in an organization and then pursues strategies to enhance those factors. The initial discovery process itself provides data ripe for qualitative analysis. Narratives were collected from 27 community mental health staff about times when they were at their best. An emergent, consensus-based analysis was used to understand the stories and exemplary work -- with competent, caring staff and elements needed to support them. Findings are discussed in light of self-determination theory that people are at their best with a sense of mastery, connection, and autonomy.

AB  - Background: The validity of conclusions from observational studies depends on decisions regarding design, analysis, data quality, and implementation. Through sensitivity analyses, we explored the impact of such decisions on balance control and risk estimates. Methods: Using as a template the Mini-Sentinel protocol for the active surveillance of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in association with use of antidiabetic agents, we defined cohorts of new users of metformin and second-generation sulfonylureas, baseline covariates and acute MI events using three combinations of washout and baseline periods. Using propensity-score matching, we assessed balance control and risk estimates using cumulative data for matching all patients compared with not rematching prior matches in quarterly analyses over the follow-up period. Results: A longer washout period increased the confidence in new-user status, but at the expense of sample size; a longer baseline period improved capture of covariates related to pre-existing chronic conditions. When all patients were matched each quarter, balance was improved and risk estimates were more robust, especially in the later quarters. Conclusions: Durations of washout and baseline periods influence the likelihood of new-user status and sample size. Matching all patients tends to result in better covariate balance than matching only new patients. Decisions regarding the durations of washout and baseline periods depend on the specific research question and availability of longitudinal patient data within the database. This paper demonstrates the importance and utility of sensitivity analysis of methods for evaluating the robustness of results in observational studies.

AB  - Two randomized trials exemplify strategies for administering behavioral interventions through distance therapy-the use of telemedicine or e-health approaches to treating patients outside the conventional in-person office-based visit. In the first trial, telephone-based coping skills training for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not more effective than an education control in reducing mortality or rehospitalization. However, it was superior in improving psychological and somatic quality of life. In the second trial, a web-based distress management program was not more effective than usual care in postoperative psychological outcomes in patients receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. However, both of these trials raise important methodological issues in designing and interpreting trials testing telehealth delivery of behavioral interventions. Key issues include: 1) selection of the appropriate control group (e.g., when may a usual care or active comparator be preferable to an attention control?); 2) choice of the appropriate outcome (i.e., one most likely to respond to the specific intervention); 3) enrolling only patients who have at least some threshold level of the symptom or risk level for the outcome being targeted by the intervention; 4) focusing on patients likely to participate in telehealth or other distance-administered treatment programs; and 5) optimal timing for the delivery of behavioral interventions that may occur around the time of major events such as hospitalization or procedures. A policy implication is that once distance therapy interventions are proven effective, reimbursement changes will be necessary to enhance the likelihood of uptake by providers and health care systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the reasons for which erupted third molars (3M) are extracted in a sample of Mexican patients.A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 83 patients attending exodontia (minor oral surgery) clinics of a public university in Mexico (Autonomous University of Hidalgo State). The outcome variable was the reason for extractions using Kay and Blinkhorn's classification. The independent variables were age, gender, arch and tooth number according to the World Health Organization (WHO). For statistical analysis, we used the Chi-squared test in Stata 9.0.Eighty-three patients underwent 150 3M extractions. Mean age was 38.67 ± 13.96 years, and 71.1% were female. The four reasons for 3M extraction were prosthetic (44.0%), followed by orthodontic (24.7%), dental caries (20.0%) and periodontal disease (11.3%). Differences were observed in the reasons for 3M extractions across age groups (p < 0.05). No significant differences existed between men and women (p > 0.05), or the WHO tooth number (p > 0.05).Women and patients 18 to 34 years of age had erupted 3M extracted more frequently, primarily for prosthetic reasons. The age profile indicated a trend in demand for services that differ from those of overall tooth extractions, but not for the trend across gender.

AB  - Shortages of health workers and large number of HIV-infected persons in Africa mean that time to provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and other messages to patients is limited.Using time-motion methodology, we documented the intensity and nature of counseling delivered to patients. The study was conducted at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in western Kenya. We recorded all activities of 190 adult patients on ART during their return clinic visits to assess type, frequency, and duration of counseling messages.Mean visit length for patients at the rural clinic was 44.5 (SD = 27.9) minutes and at urban clinic was 78.2 (SD = 42.1) minutes. Median time spent receiving any counseling during a visit was 4.07 minutes [interquartile range (IQR), 1.57-7.33] at rural and 3.99 (IQR, 2.87-6.25) minutes at urban, representing 11% and 8% of total mean visit time, respectively. Median time patients received ART adherence counseling was 1.29 (IQR, 0.77-2.83) minutes at rural and 1.76 (IQR, 1.23-2.83) minutes at urban (P = 0.001 for difference). Patients received a median time of 0.18 (0-0.72) minutes at rural and 0.28 (IQR, 0-0.67) minutes at urban clinic of counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy. Most patients in the study did not receive any counseling regarding alcohol/substance use, emerging risks for ongoing HIV transmission.Although ART adherence was discussed with most patients, time was limited. Reproductive counseling was provided to only half of the patients, and "positive prevention" messaging was minimal. There are strategic opportunities to enhance counseling and information received by clients within HIV programs in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Provider recommendation is a significant predictor of HPV vaccine uptake. Prior research suggests that concerns regarding risk compensation could cause some providers to hesitate recommending the HPV vaccine.During 15-30 minute semi-structured interviews in early 2015, 22 U.S. pediatric providers were asked about their beliefs regarding sexual risk compensation and cervical cancer screening following HPV vaccination. Providers were asked if these beliefs result in reservations recommending the vaccine. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis.None of the providers believed the HPV vaccine would result in risky sexual behavior. Half indicated it was better to start vaccination early, before sexual activity was a worry. Others noted that patients' risky behavior decisions happen independently of vaccination. When providers were asked if they were concerned about decreased cervical cancer screening, half said they did not know and some stated they had never thought about it before. The main themes addressed were the significant time lapse between vaccination and screening and that women tend to get over-screened as opposed to under-screened.Providers were generally in favor of HPV vaccination and do not perceive risk compensation as a barrier to HPV recommendation.

AB  - High utilizers of emergency departments account for a disproportionate number of visits, often for nonemergency conditions. This study aims to identify these high users prospectively. Routinely recorded registration data from the Indiana Public Health Emergency Surveillance System was used to predict whether patients would revisit the Emergency Department within one month, three months, and six months of an index visit. Separate models were trained for each outcome period, and several predictive models were tested. Random Forest models had good performance and calibration for all outcome periods, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of at least 0.96. This high performance was found to be due to non-linear interactions among variables in the data. The ability to predict repeat emergency visits may provide an opportunity to establish, prioritize, and target interventions to ensure that patients have access to the care they require outside an emergency department setting.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Medical Home program's depression module on patients' depression severity measurement over time.Retrospective chart review.Public hospital system.Patients enrolled in the ABC Medical Home program between October 1, 2012 and March 31, 2014.The response of 773 enrolled patients who had multiple patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores recorded in the ABC Medical Home program's depression care protocol was evaluated. Repeatedly measured PHQ-9 change scores were the dependent variables in the mixed effects models, and demographic and comorbid medical conditions were tested as potential independent variables while including random effects for time and intercept.Among those patients with baseline PHQ-9 scores >10, there was a significant decrease in PHQ-9 scores over time (P<0.001); however, the effect differed by gender (P=0.015). On average, women's scores (4.5 point drop at 1 month) improved faster than men's scores (1 point drop at 1 month). Moreover, both men and women had a predicted drop of 7 points (>50% decline from baseline) on the PHQ-9 at 6 months.These analyses demonstrate evidence for the sustained effectiveness of the ABC Medical Home program at inducing depression remission outcomes while employing clinical staff who required less formal training than earlier clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose To explore medical students’ conceptions of “the good doctor” at two points in time separated by 14 years. Method The authors conducted qualitative analysis of narrative-based essays. Following a constant comparative method, an emergent relational coding scheme was developed which the authors used to characterize 110 essays submitted to the Arnold P. Gold Foundation Humanism in Medicine Essay Contest in 1999 (n = 50) and 2013 (n = 60) in response to the prompt, “Who is the good doctor?” Results The authors identified five relational themes as guiding the day-to-day work and lives of physicians: doctor–patient, doctor–self, doctor–learner, doctor–colleague, and doctor–system/society/profession. The authors noted a highly similar distribution of primary and secondary relational themes for essays from 1999 and 2013. The majority of the essays emphasized the centrality of the doctor–patient relationship. Student essays focused little on teamwork, systems innovation, or technology use—all important developments in contemporary medicine. Conclusions Medical students’ narrative reflections are increasingly used as rich sources of information about the lived experience of medical education. The findings reported here suggest that medical students understand the “good doctor” as a relational being, with an enduring emphasis on the doctor–patient relationship. Medical education would benefit from including an emphasis on the relational aspects of medicine. Future research should focus on relational learning as a pedagogical approach that may support the formation of caring, effective physicians embedded in a complex array of relationships within clinical, community, and larger societal contexts.

AB  - To assess impact of an onsite clinic on healthcare utilization of preventive services for employees of a public university and their dependents.Descriptive statistics, logistic regression and classification tree techniques were used to assess health claim data to identify changes in patterns of healthcare utilization and factors impacting usage of onsite clinic.Utilization of preventive services significantly increased for women and men employees by 9% and 14% one year after implementation of the onsite clinic. Hourly-paid employees, employees without diabetes, employees with spouse opt out or no coverage were more likely to go to the onsite clinic.Adapted framework for assessing performance of onsite clinics based on usage of health informatics would help to identify health utilization patterns and interaction between onsite clinic and offsite health providers.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Objective: Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have ongoing needs that impair home and school functioning. Group visit models are a promising way to deliver timely parenting support but family and provider acceptance has not previously been examined. The objective was to describe the acceptability of ADHD group visits in busy pediatric clinics based on caregivers, child participants and facilitators. Methods: Data were analyzed from school-age children and caregivers who participated in one of two 12-month long randomized controlled studies of the ADHD group visit model from 2012 to 2013 or 2014 to 2015. Feedback was obtained using semi-structured questions at each study end, by telephone or at the last group visit. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and themes were extracted by participant type. Results: A total of 34 caregivers, 41 children and 9 facilitators offered feedback. Caregivers enjoyed the “support group” aspect and learning new things from others. Caregivers reported improved understanding of ADHD and positive changes in the relationship with their child. Children were able to recall specific skills learned including how skills helped at home or school. Facilitators acknowledged systems-level challenges to offering group visits but felt the group format helped increase understanding of families' needs, improved overall care, and provided innovative ways to engage with families. Conclusion: The majority of comments from families and facilitators highlighted a variety of benefits of the use of a group visit model for ADHD chronic care. Despite systems-level barriers to implementation, families and facilitators felt the benefits outweighed the challenges.

AB  - Objective. While multimodal treatment approaches for fibromyalgia (FM), incorporating exercise, have been found most effective, information about factors associated with exercise adoption and maintenance is lacking. Design, Setting, and Methods. Women veterans with FM (N = 19) completed an anonymous Internet survey measuring FM impact (FI), adoption of exercise behavior, and self-efficacy for exercise. Using classifications of behavior specified by the transtheoretical model, the self-efficacy of participants classified in the action or maintenance (AM) stages was compared with those in earlier stages (precontemplation through preparation) of exercise readiness. Multivariate analysis of variance analyses examined differences in FI domains by stage of change. Analysis of covariance examined whether exercise self-efficacy differed by stage of change while controlling for FI. Results. Higher levels of self-efficacy were detected among participants in the AM stages. Participants in the AM stages also reported higher levels of FI symptoms. After controlling for FI, self-efficacy did not differ significantly between the 2 groups; however the effect size was large (η 2 = .11). Conclusions. Findings of this pilot study suggest a role for self-efficacy in exercise adoption and maintenance, even in the setting of higher FM symptoms. Replication of this study with a larger sample size is warranted.

AB  - Given the widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in health care organizations, public health agencies are interested in accessing EHR data to improve health assessment and surveillance. Yet there exist few examples in the U.S. of governmental health agencies using EHR data routinely to examine disease prevalence and other measures of community health. The objective of this study was to explore local health department (LHD) professionals' perceptions of the usefulness of EHR-based community health measures, and to examine these perceptions in the context of LHDs' current access and use of sub-county data, data aggregated at geographic levels smaller than county.To explore perceived usefulness, we conducted an online survey of LHD professionals in Indiana. One hundred and thirty-three (133) individuals from thirty-one (31) LHDs participated. The survey asked about usefulness of specific community health measures as well as current access to and uses of sub-county population health data. Descriptive statistics were calculated to examine respondents' perceptions, access, and use. A one-way ANOVA (with pairwise comparisons) test was used to compare average scores by LHD size.Respondents overall indicated moderate agreement on which community health measures might be useful. Perceived usefulness of specific EHR-based community health measures varied by size of respondent's LHD [F(3, 88) = 3.56, p = 0.017]. Over 70% of survey respondents reported using community health data, but of those < 30% indicated they had access to sub-county level data.Respondents generally preferred familiar community health measures versus novel, EHR-based measures that are not in widespread use within health departments. Access to sub-county data is limited but strongly desired. Future research and development is needed as LHD staff gain access to EHR data and apply these data to support the core function of health assessment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore perceptions of critical care providers about a novel collaborative inpatient health information technology (HIT) in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods This cross-sectional, concurrent mixed methods study was conducted in the PICU of a large midwestern children’s hospital. The technology, the Large Customizable Interactive Monitor (LCIM), is a flat panel touch screen monitor that displays validated patient information from the electronic health record. It does not require a password to login and is available in each patient’s room for viewing and interactive use by physicians, nurses, and families. Quantitative data were collected via self-administered, standardized surveys, and qualitative data via in-person, semistructured interviews between January and April 2015. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis. Results The qualitative analysis showed positive impacts of the LCIM on providers’ workflow, team interactions, and interactions with families. Providers reported concerns regarding perceived patient information overload and associated anxiety and burden for families. Sixty percent of providers thought that LCIM was useful for their jobs at different levels, and almost 70% of providers reported that LCIM improved information sharing and communication with families. The average overall satisfaction score was 3.4 on a 0 to 6 scale, between “a moderate amount” and “pretty much.” Discussion and Conclusion This study provides new insight into collaborative HIT in the inpatient pediatric setting and demonstrates that using such technology has the potential to improve providers’ experiences with families and just-in-time access to EHR information in a format more easily shared with families.

AB  - Considerable epidemiologic evidence and plausible biobehavioral mechanisms suggest that depression is an independent risk factor for diabetes. Moreover, reducing the elevated diabetes risk of depressed individuals is imperative given that both conditions are leading causes of death and disability. However, because no prior study has examined clinical diabetes outcomes among depressed patients at risk for diabetes, the question of whether depression treatment prevents or delays diabetes onset remains unanswered. Accordingly, we examined the effect of a 12-month collaborative care program for late-life depression on 9-year diabetes incidence among depressed, older adults initially free of diabetes. Participants were 119 primary care patients [M (SD) age: 67.2 (6.9) years, 41% African American] with a depressive disorder but without diabetes enrolled at the Indiana sites of the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) trial. Incident diabetes cases were defined as diabetes diagnoses, positive laboratory values, or diabetes medication prescription, and were identified using electronic medical record and Medicare/Medicaid data. Surprisingly, the rate of incident diabetes in the collaborative care group was 37% (22/59) versus 28% (17/60) in the usual care group. Even though the collaborative care group exhibited greater reductions in depressive symptom severity (p = .024), unadjusted (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.69-2.43, p = .428) and adjusted (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.61-2.29, p = .616) Cox proportional hazards models indicated that the risk of incident diabetes did not differ between the treatment groups. Our novel preliminary findings raise the possibility that depression treatment alone may be insufficient to reduce the excess diabetes risk of depressed, older adults.

AB  - Background: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. Objective: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. Setting/Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. Measurements: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. Results: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that “Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want.” Conclusions: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have been very powerful in analyzing heterogeneous cell population and identifying cell types. Visualizing scRNA-seq data can help researchers effectively extract meaningful biological information and make new discoveries. While commonly used scRNA-seq visualization methods, such as t-SNE, are useful in detecting cell clusters, they often tear apart the intrinsic continuous structure in gene expression profiles. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) approaches like Mapper capture the shape of data by representing data as topological networks. TDA approaches are robust to noise and different platforms, while preserving the locality and data continuity. Moreover, instead of analyzing the whole dataset, Mapper allows researchers to explore biological meanings of specific pathways and genes by using different filter functions. In this paper, we applied Mapper to visualize scRNA-seq data. Our method can not only capture the clustering structure of cells, but also preserve the continuous gene expression topologies of cells. We demonstrated that by combining with gene co-expression network analysis, our method can reveal differential expression patterns of gene co-expression modules along the Mapper visualization.

AB  - The recommendations about antithrombotic medication use after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (bAVR) vary.To describe the post-bAVR antithrombotic medication practice across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and to assess the association between antithrombotic strategies and post-bAVR outcomes.Retrospective cohort study. Multivariable modeling with propensity scores was conducted to adjust for differences in patient characteristics across the 3 most common antithrombotic medication strategies (aspirin plus warfarin sodium, aspirin only, and dual antiplatelets). Text mining of notes was used to identify the patients with bAVR (fiscal years 2005-2015).This study used VHA and non-VHA outpatient pharmacy data and text notes to classify the following antithrombotic medications prescribed within 1 week after discharge from the bAVR hospitalization: aspirin plus warfarin, aspirin only, dual antiplatelets, no antithrombotics, other only, and warfarin only. The 90-day outcomes included all-cause mortality, thromboembolism risk, and bleeding events. Outcomes were identified using primary diagnosis codes from emergency department visits or hospital admissions.The cohort included 9060 veterans with bAVR at 47 facilities (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [8.8] years; 98.6% male). The number of bAVR procedures per year increased from 610 in fiscal year 2005 to 1072 in fiscal year 2015. The most commonly prescribed antithrombotic strategy was aspirin only (4240 [46.8%]), followed by aspirin plus warfarin (1638 [18.1%]), no antithrombotics (1451 [16.0%]), dual antiplatelets (1010 [11.1%]), warfarin only (439 [4.8%]), and other only (282 [3.1%]). Facility variation in antithrombotic prescription patterns was observed. During the 90-day post-bAVR period, adverse events were uncommon, including all-cause mortality in 127 (1.4%), thromboembolism risk in 142 (1.6%), and bleeding events in 149 (1.6%). No differences in 90-day mortality or thromboembolism were identified across the 3 antithrombotic medication groups in either the unadjusted or adjusted models. Patients receiving the combination of aspirin plus warfarin had higher odds of bleeding than patients receiving aspirin only in the unadjusted analysis (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.71-3.89) and after full risk adjustment (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.17-3.14).These data demonstrate that bAVR procedures are increasingly being performed in VHA facilities and that aspirin only was the most commonly used antithrombotic medication strategy after bAVR. The risk-adjusted results suggest that the combination of aspirin plus warfarin does not improve either all-cause mortality or thromboembolism risk but increases the risk of bleeding events compared with aspirin only.

AB  - Introduction: Timeliness of data availability is a key performance measure in cancer reporting. Previous studies evaluated timeliness of cancer reporting using a single metric, yet this metric obscures the details within each step of the reporting process. To enhance understanding of cancer reporting processes, we measured the timeliness of discrete cancer reporting steps and examined changes in timeliness across a decade.Methods: We analyzed 76,259 cases of breast, colorectal and lung cancer reported to the Indiana State Cancer Registry between 2001 and 2011. We measured timeliness for three fundamental reporting steps: report completion time, report submission time, and report processing time. Timeliness was measured as the difference, in days, between timestamps recorded in the cancer registry at each step. We further examined the reporting pattern among facilities within each step.Results: Identifying and gathering details about cases (report completion) accounts for the largest proportion of time during the cancer reporting process. Although submission time accounts for a lesser proportion of time, there is wide variation among facilities. One-seventh (7 out of 49) facilities accounted for 28.4% of the total cases reported, all of which took more than 100 days to submit the completed cases to the registry.Conclusions: Measuring timeliness of the individual steps in reporting processes can enable cancer registry programs to target individual facilities as well as tasks that could be improved to reduce overall case reporting times. Process improvement could strengthen cancer control programs and enable more rapid discovery in cancer research.

AB  - ContextIt is especially important that patients are well informed when making high-stakes, preference-sensitive decisions like those on the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form. However, there is currently no way to easily evaluate whether patients understand key concepts when making these important decisions.ObjectivesTo develop a POLST knowledge survey.MethodsExpert (n = 62) ratings of key POLST facts were used to select items for a POLST knowledge survey. The survey was administered to nursing facility residents (n = 97) and surrogate decision-makers (n = 112). A subset (n = 135) were re-administered the survey after a standardized advance care planning discussion to assess the scale's responsiveness to change.ResultsThe 19-item survey demonstrated adequate reliability (α = 0.72.). Residents' scores (x = 11.4, standard deviation 3.3) were significantly lower than surrogate scores (x = 14.7, standard deviation 2.5) (P < 0.001). Scores for both groups increased significantly after administration of a standardized advance care planning discussion (P < 0.001). Although being a surrogate, age, race, education, cognitive functioning, and health literacy were significantly associated with higher POLST Knowledge Survey scores in univariate analyses, only being a surrogate (P < 0.001) and being white (P = 0.028) remained significantly associated with higher scores in multivariate analyses.ConclusionThe 19-item POLST Knowledge Survey demonstrated adequate reliability and responsiveness to change. Findings suggest the survey could be used to identify knowledge deficits and provide targeted education to ensure adequate understanding of key clinical decisions when completing POLST.

AB  - A reliable and valid clinically practical multi-domain self-report and caregiver-report tool is needed for tracking actionable symptoms in primary care for elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs).Assess internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity to change for SymTrak.Among 600 (200 patient-caregiver dyads, 200 patients without an identified caregiver) participants, SymTrak was telephone interviewer-administered at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and at 24 h post-baseline for assessing test-retest reliability in a random subsample of 180 (60 dyads, 60 individual patients) participants.Demographic questions, SymTrak, Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3).Exploratory factor analysis indicated a single dominant dimension for SymTrak items for both patients and caregivers. Coefficient alpha and 24-h test-retest reliability, respectively, were high for the 23-item SymTrak total score for both patient-reported (0.85; 0.87) and caregiver-reported (0.86; 0.91) scores. Construct validity was supported by monotone decreasing relationships between the mean of SymTrak total scores across the poor-to-excellent categories of physical and emotional general health, and by high correlations with HUI3 overall utility score, even after adjusting for demographic covariates (standardized linear regression coefficient = - 0.84 for patients; - 0.70 for caregivers). Three-month change in the SymTrak total score was sensitive to detecting criterion standard 3-month reliable change categories (Improved, Stable, Declined) in HUI3-based health-related quality of life, especially for caregiver-reported scores.SymTrak demonstrates good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity to change over a 3-month period, supporting its use for monitoring symptoms for older adults with MCCs.

AB  - A clinically practical, brief, user-friendly, multi-domain self-report and caregiver-report tool is needed for tracking actionable symptoms in primary care for elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs).Develop and assess usability, administration time, and internal reliability of SymTrak.Phase I: legacy instruments, content validity, analyses of existing data, focus groups (physicians, nurses, patients, informal caregivers), and Think Aloud interviews (patients, caregivers) were used to develop SymTrak. Phase II (pilot feasibility study): 81 (27 patient-caregiver dyads, 27 patients without an identified caregiver) participants were self-administered SymTrak in clinic.SymTrak and demographic questions.Consistent themes emerged from phase I focus groups. Ambiguous wording was corrected with Think Aloud feedback. In phase II, patients and caregivers preferred circling words instead of numbers for item response options. SymTrak self-administration completion time in clinic was brief; mean was 2.4, 3.0, and 3.3 min for the finalized circlingwords version, respectively, for caregivers, dyadic patients, and patients without a caregiver; and the maximum was 6.2 min for any participant. Usability questionnaire ratings were high. Cronbach's alpha for the SymTrak 23-item total score was 0.86, 0.79, and 0.81 for caregivers, dyadic patients, and patients without a caregiver, respectively.SymTrak demonstrates content validity, positive qualitative findings, high perceived usability, brief self-administered completion time, and good internal reliability.

AB  - Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (GCNA) helps identify gene modules with potential biological functions and has become a popular method in bioinformatics and biomedical research. However, most current GCNA algorithms use correlation to build gene co-expression networks and identify modules with highly correlated genes. There is a need to look beyond correlation and identify gene modules using other similarity measures for finding novel biologically meaningful modules.We propose a new generalized gene co-expression analysis algorithm via subspace clustering that can identify biologically meaningful gene co-expression modules with genes that are not all highly correlated. We use low-rank representation to construct gene co-expression networks and local maximal quasi-clique merger to identify gene co-expression modules. We applied our method on three large microarray datasets and a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. We demonstrate that our method can identify gene modules with different biological functions than current GCNA methods and find gene modules with prognostic values.The presented method takes advantage of subspace clustering to generate gene co-expression networks rather than using correlation as the similarity measure between genes. Our generalized GCNA method can provide new insights from gene expression datasets and serve as a complement to current GCNA algorithms.

AB  - Abstract Children receiving a LDLT have superior post‐transplant outcomes, but this procedure is only used for 10% of transplant recipients. Better understanding about barriers toward LDLT and the sociodemographic characteristics that influence these underlying mechanisms would help to inform strategies to increase its use. We conducted an online, anonymous survey of parents/caregivers for children awaiting, or have received, a liver transplant regarding their knowledge and attitudes about LDLT. The survey was completed by 217 respondents. While 97% of respondents understood an individual could donate a portion of their liver, only 72% knew the steps in evaluation, and 69% understood the donor surgery was covered by the recipient's insurance. Individuals with public insurance were less likely than those with private insurance to know the steps for LDLT evaluation (44% vs 82%; P &lt; 0.001). Respondents with public insurance were less likely to know someone that had been a living donor (44% vs 56%; P = 0.005) as were individuals without a college degree (64% vs 85%; P = 0.007). Nearly all respondents generally trusted their healthcare team. Among respondents, 82% believed they were well‐informed about LDLT but individuals with public insurance were significantly less likely to feel well‐informed (67% vs 87%; P = 0.03) and to understand how donor surgery might impact donor work/time off (44% vs 81%; P = 0.001). Substantial gaps exist in parental understanding about LDLT, including its evaluation, potential benefits, and complications. Greater emphasis on addressing these barriers, especially to individuals with fewer resources, will be helpful to expand the use of LDLT.

AB  - Since the inception of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), many have acknowledged the potential synergy between ACOs and health information technology (IT) in meeting quality and cost goals.We conducted a systematic review of the literature in order to describe what research has been conducted at the intersection of health IT and ACOs and identify directions for future research.We identified empirical studies discussing the use of health IT via PubMed search with subsequent snowball reference review. The type of health IT, how health IT was included in the study, use of theory, population, and findings were extracted from each study.Our search resulted in 32 studies describing the intersection of health IT and ACOs, mainly in the form of electronic health records and health information exchange. Studies were divided into three streams by purpose; those that considered health IT as a factor for ACO participation, health IT use by current ACOs, and ACO performance as a function of health IT capabilities. Although most studies found a positive association between health IT and ACO participation, studies that address the performance of ACOs in terms of their health IT capabilities show more mixed results.In order to better understand this emerging relationship between health IT and ACO performance, we propose future research should consider more quasi-experimental studies, the use of theory, and merging health, quality, cost, and health IT use data across ACO member organizations.

AB  - Rhabdomyosarcoma is subclassified by the presence or absence of a recurrent chromosome translocation that fuses the FOXO1 and PAX3 or PAX7 genes. The fusion protein (FOXO1-PAX3/7) retains both binding domains and becomes a novel and potent transcriptional regulator in rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. Many studies have characterized and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes that contain the FOXO1-PAX3/7 gene fusion and those that do not; however, few investigations have investigated how gene co-expression networks are altered by FOXO1-PAX3/7. Although transcriptional data offer insight into one level of functional regulation, gene co-expression networks have the potential to identify biological interactions and pathways that underpin oncogenesis and tumorigenicity. Thus, we examined gene co-expression networks for rhabdomyosarcoma that were FOXO1-PAX3 positive, FOXO1-PAX7 positive, or fusion negative. Gene co-expression networks were mined using local maximum Quasi-Clique Merger (lmQCM) and analyzed for co-expression differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. This analysis observed 41 co-expression modules that were shared between fusion negative and positive samples, of which 17/41 showed significant up- or down-regulation in respect to fusion status. Fusion positive and negative rhabdomyosarcoma showed differing modularity of co-expression networks with fusion negative (n = 109) having significantly more individual modules than fusion positive (n = 53). Subsequent analysis of gene co-expression networks for PAX3 and PAX7 type fusions observed 17/53 were differentially expressed between the two subtypes. Gene list enrichment analysis found that gene ontology terms were poorly matched with biological processes and molecular function for most co-expression modules identified in this study; however, co-expressed modules were frequently localized to cytobands on chromosomes 8 and 11. Overall, we observed substantial restructuring of co-expression networks relative to fusion status and fusion type in rhabdomyosarcoma and identified previously overlooked genes and pathways that may be targeted in this pernicious disease.

AB  - • Data mining techniques can be applied to repeat users of emergency department care. • Information integrated from distributed sources enabled four Hidden Markov Models. • Integrating pre-analysis of HMMs yielded better predictions. The use of machine learning techniques is especially pertinent to the composite and challenging conditions of emergency departments (EDs). Repeat ED visits (i.e. revisits) are an example of potentially inappropriate utilization of resources that can be forecasted by these techniques. To track the ED revisit risk over time using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a major latent class model. Given the HMM states, we carried out forecasting of future ED revisits with various data mining models. Information integrated from four distributed sources (e.g. electronic health records and health information exchange) was integrated into four HMMs which capture the relationships between an observed and a hidden progression that shift over time through a series of hidden states in an adult patient population. Assimilating a pre-analysis of the various patients by applying latent class models and directing them to well-known classifiers functioned well. The performance was significantly better than without utilizing pre-analysis of HMM for all prediction models (classifiers(. These findings suggest that one prospective approach to advanced risk prediction is to leverage the longitudinal nature of health care data by exploiting patients’ between state variation.

AB  - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have significant symptom burden. Reduced provider awareness of symptoms contributes to underutilization of symptom management resources. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We hypothesized that improved nephrologist awareness of symptoms leads to symptom improvement. In this prospective, multicenter interventional study, 53 (age &amp;#x3e;65) ESRD inpatients underwent symptom assessment using the modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at admission and 1-week post-discharge. Physicians caring for the enrollees were asked if they felt their patients would die within the year, and then sequentially randomized to receive the results of the baseline survey (group 1) or to not receive the results (group 2). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Fifty-two patients completed the study; 1 died. Baseline characteristics were compared. For 70% of the total cohort, physicians reported that they would not be surprised if their patient died within a year. There was no difference in baseline scores of the patients between the 2 physician groups. Severity ratings were compared between in-hospital and post discharge scores and between physicians who received the results versus those that did not. Total ESAS scores improved more in group 1 (12.9) than in group 2 (9.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Among individual symptoms, there was greater improvement in pain control (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), and nominal improvement in itching (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) in group 1 as compared to group 2. There were 3 palliative care consults. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our findings reinforce the high symptom burden prevalent in older ESRD patients. The improvement in total scores, and individual symptoms of pain and itching in group 1 indicates better symptom control when physician awareness is increased. Residual symptoms post hospitalization and low utilization of palliative care resources are suggestive of a missed opportunity by nephrologists to address the high symptom burden at the inpatient encounter, which is selective for sick patients and/or indication of inadequacy of dialysis to control these symptoms.

AB  - Abstract The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which regulates residency and fellowship training in the United States, recently revised the minimum standards for all training programs. These standards are codified and published as the Common Program Requirements. Recent specific revisions, particularly removing the requirement ensuring protected time for core faculty, are poised to have a substantial impact on emergency medicine training programs. A group of representatives and relevant stakeholders from national emergency medicine (EM) organizations was convened to assess the potential effects of these changes on core faculty and the training of emergency physicians. We reviewed the literature and results of surveys conducted by EM organizations to examine the role of core faculty protected time. Faculty nonclinical activities contribute greatly to the academic missions of EM training programs. Protected time and reduced clinical hours allow core faculty to engage in education and research, which are two of the three core pillars of academic EM. Loss of core faculty protected time is expected to have detrimental impacts on training programs and on EM generally. We provide consensus recommendations regarding EM core faculty clinical work hour limitations to maintain protected time for educational activities and scholarship and preserve the quality of academic EM.

AB  - Pain, anxiety, and depression commonly co-occur, can have reciprocal effects, and are associated with substantial disability and health care costs. However, few interventions target treatment of pain and mood disorders as a whole. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Pain Symptoms (CAMMPS) trial was a randomized trial comparing two pragmatic telecare interventions, a high- vs low-resource approach to pain and anxiety/depression treatment. The purpose of the current study is to better understand patients' perspectives on both intervention approaches, including intervention components, delivery, patient experiences, and patient outcomes.Qualitative, semistructured interviews.A Veterans Affairs Medical Center.Twenty-five patients were purposefully sampled from both study arms.Patients were interviewed about their experiences with pain and mood treatment, perceived benefits and changes, and experiences with the intervention model to which they were randomized. The constant comparison method guided analysis.Pain was more important than mood for most participants. Participants described developing increased awareness of their symptoms, including connecting pain and mood, which enabled better management. Participants in the high-resource intervention described the added value of the study nurse in their symptom management.Patients in a telecare intervention for chronic pain and mood symptoms learned to connect pain and mood and be more aware of their symptoms, enabling more effective symptom management. Patients in the high-resource intervention described the added benefits of a nurse who provided informational and motivational support. Implications for tradeoffs between resource intensity and patient outcomes are discussed.

AB  - Survivorship care plans (SCPs) serve to communicate critical information needed for cancer survivors' long-term follow-up care. The extent to which SCPs are tailored to meet the specific needs of underserved patient populations is understudied. To fill this gap, this study aimed to assess the content and communication appropriateness of SCPs collected from diverse healthcare settings. We analyzed collected SCPs (n = 16) for concordance with Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for SCP content and for communication appropriateness using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) instrument. All plans failed to incorporate all IOM criteria, with the majority of plans (n = 11) incorporating less than 60% of recommended content. The average reading grade level of all the plans was 14, and only one plan received a superior rating for cultural appropriateness. There is significant variation in the format and content of SCPs used in diverse hospital settings and most plans are not written at an appropriate reading grade level nor tailored for underserved and/or minority patient populations. Co-designing SCPs with diverse patient populations is crucial to ensure that these documents are meeting the needs and preferences of all cancer survivors.

AB  - With the advent of interoperability standards such as FHIR, SMART, CDS Hooks, and CQL, interoperable clinical decision support (CDS) holds great promise for improving healthcare. In 2018, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-sponsored Patient-Centered CDS Learning Network (PCCDS LN) chartered a Technical Framework Working Group (TechFWG) to identify barriers, facilitators, and potential solutions for interoperable CDS, with a specific focus on addressing the opioid epidemic. Through an open, multi-stakeholder process that engaged 54 representatives from healthcare, industry, and academia, the TechFWG identified barriers in 6 categories: regulatory environment, data integration, scalability, business case, effective and useful CDS, and care planning and coordination. Facilitators and key recommendations were also identified for overcoming these barriers. The key insights were also extrapolated to CDS-facilitated care improvement outside of the specific opioid use case. If applied broadly, the recommendations should help advance the availability and impact of interoperable CDS delivered at scale.

AB  - Context Rural communities face unique challenges including fewer healthcare providers and restricted access to nutritious foods, likely leading to poor health outcomes. Community health coalitions are groups of local organizations partnering to address local health needs. Employing such coalitions is one strategy for implementing policy–system–environment changes for improving rural health. However, their success is variable without standardized evaluation. In this review, rural community health coalitions were retrospectively assessed using the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Logic Model. Community health coalition–reported pathways through this model were explored using market basket analysis. Evidence acquisition During Spring 2018, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for (coalition) AND (rural) AND (health) AND (effectiveness OR impact OR outcome OR logic model). Full-text, peer-reviewed, English articles meeting PICOS criteria (Population, rural communities; Intervention, presence of a community health coalition; Comparator, the coalition over time; Outcomes, logic model pathways) were reviewed. During Summer and Fall 2018, coalition-reported pathways were categorized according to logic model inputs and resources; internal and external activities; outputs; short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes; and impact. Market basket analysis was conducted during Winter 2018. Evidence synthesis The 10 most frequently reported pathway items were partner diversity; organizational structures; implementing pilot studies, programs, and interventions; funding; community engagement and outreach; university partners; holding regular meetings; having working groups and subcommittees; operating under or partnering with a regional research initiative; and conducting a community health and needs assessment. Half of community health coalitions reported 4 or more of the following: funding; partner diversity; university partners; organizational structures; community engagement and outreach; and implementing pilot studies, programs, and interventions. Conclusions Many rural community health coalitions reported inputs and capacity building; few impacted health. Recommending common early phase logic model pathways may facilitate downstream success.

AB  - Abstract Background Research on the role of trait versus state characteristics of a variety of measures among persons experiencing pain has been a focus for the past few decades. Studying the trait versus state nature of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐8) depression scale would be highly informative given both are commonly measured in pain populations and neither scale has been studied for trait/state contributions. Methods The PHQ‐8 and PCS were obtained on persons undergoing knee arthroplasty at baseline, 2‐, 6‐ and 12‐month post‐surgery ( N = 402). The multi‐trait generalization of the latent trait–state model was used to partition trait and state variability in PCS and PHQ‐8 item responses simultaneously. A set of variables were used to predict trait catastrophizing and trait depression. Results For total scores, the latent traits and latent states explain 63.2% (trait = 43.2%; state = 20.0%) and 50.2% (trait = 29.4%; state = 20.8%) of the variability in PCS and PHQ‐8, respectively. Patients with a high number of bodily pain sites, high levels of anxiety, young patients and African‐American patients had high levels of trait catastrophizing and trait depression. The PCS and the PHQ‐8 consist of both enduring trait and dynamic state characteristics, with trait characteristics dominating for both measures. Conclusion Clinicians and researchers using these scales should not assume the obtained measurements solely reflect either trait‐ or state‐based characteristics. Significance Clinicians and researchers using the PCS or PHQ‐8 scales are measuring both state and trait characteristics and not just trait‐ or state‐based characteristics.

AB  - The Community of Practice (CoP) model represents one approach to address knowledge management to support effective implementation of best practices.We sought to identify CoP developmental strategies within the context of a national quality improvement project focused on improving the quality for patients receiving acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) care.Stepped wedge trial.Multidisciplinary staff at six Veterans Affairs medical facilities.To encourage site implementation of a multi-component quality improvement intervention, the trial included strategies to improve the development of a CoP: site kickoff meetings, CoP conference calls, and an interactive website (the "Hub").Mixed-methods evaluation included data collected through a CoP attendance log; semi-structured interviews with site participants at 6 months (n = 32) and 12 months (n = 30), and CoP call facilitators (n = 2); and 22 CoP call debriefings.The critical seeding structures that supported the cultivation of the CoP were the kickoffs which fostered relationships (key to the community element of CoPs) and provided the evidence base relevant to TIA care (key to the domain element of CoPs). The Hub provided the forum for sharing quality improvement plans and other tools which were further highlighted during the CoP calls (key to the practice element of CoPs). CoP calls were curated to create a positive context around participants' work by recognizing team successes. In addition to improving care at their local facilities, the community created a shared set of tools which built on their collective knowledge and could be shared within and outside the group.The PREVENT CoP advanced the mission of the learning healthcare system by successfully providing a forum for shared learning. The CoP was grown through seeding structures that included kickoffs, CoP calls, and the Hub. A CoP expands upon the learning collaborative implementation strategy as an effective implementation practice.

AB  - Emergency department (ED) visits for falls among older adults are often sentinel events for poor health trajectories; however, challenges exist in defining fall-related visits in the ED. Diagnosis codes are a standard method for identifying falls in large administrative data sets. Although a common practice for many conditions, this strategy may miss many patients presenting with falls in the ED. Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a set of techniques by which language as written or spoken by humans can be rendered analyzable by computation. Our team recently developed and validated a simple rules-based NLP system that accurately identified falls from the text of ED physician notes.1 Although this performance is encouraging, barriers exist to using this methodology for all investigations of falls. Researchers, administrators, and epidemiologists often face tradeoffs between large data sets that cover populations of interest but do not have granular clinical data and data sets that are clinically generated and contain more information on fewer patients. Insurance claims, for instance, generate comprehensive data on large populations, making claims-based data sets attractive for studying fall epidemiology. However, they do not contain provider notes or other clinical information. Furthermore, even when text is available in clinical data sets, application of NLP requires programming expertise for retrospective studies and potentially new information technology infrastructure at the health system level to process large numbers of notes or real-time implementation within an electronic health record (EHR).2, 3 Given these barriers to applying NLP, claims-based strategies will continue to have a role in studying falls. When deciding on and applying a strategy for identifying falls, it is critical to understand relevant performance characteristics to interpret results or design interventions. The goal of this study was to compare performance characteristics of several fall identification strategies using EHR data from ED visits using manual chart abstraction as a gold standard. We performed a retrospective observational study using EHR data at an academic medical center with approximately 60,000 ED visits per year. The study was approved by the institutional review board. The current analysis uses the same set of 500 ED visits from unique patients aged 65 and older as did the previous NLP validation study.1 Visits were randomly selected from the period between December 13, 2016, and April 24, 2017. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes: Two previously described fall identification strategies based on the ICD code were tested.4, 5 These strategies were developed using ICD-9 codes (listed below). We created a crosswalk to migrate our ICD-10 data from the more limited ICD-9 codes and then applied the ICD-9 fall definitions. Each method was compared with manual abstraction, using Stata v.15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and MedCalc (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) to calculate statistics. Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratios, and F1 scores were calculated for each comparison. The F1 score refers to the harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity, and it is often used as a measure of accuracy in the field of document retrieval. We used 95% confidence intervals to determine significant differences between fall identification strategies. Of the 500 ED visits, 494 were able to be matched with abstracted hospital administrative data. Human coders (manual abstraction) determined that 119 of the 494 ED provider notes (24.1%) explicitly mentioned a fall as a contributing reason for that visit. All five code-based strategies identified fewer falls, ranging from 72 (14.6%) identified using CC to 116 falls (23.5%) identified using the Broad/CC strategy. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1 score are presented in Table 1. When compared with manual chart review, NLP was the most accurate fall identification strategy, followed by the combination of a restrictive ICD code–based definition with CC (Restrictive/CC strategy). The ICD code and CC alone strategies performed more poorly. Among ICD code definitions, the broad definition had the same overall accuracy as the restrictive strategy, with the broad definition improving on the restrictive strategy's sensitivity at the cost of a significant loss in precision. Strategies combining ICD codes with CC performed significantly better than those using only CC or an ICD-based strategy but still more poorly than the NLP approach with regard to both overall accuracy and F1 score. As demonstrated by the likelihood ratios and specificities, however, the CC, restrictive coding, and combination of these strategies (Restrictive/CC) all had superior performance in the task of conclusively identifying (ruling in) a fall visit. This study was performed at a single center, potentially limiting generalizability to other settings where coding and/or CC may be subject to different recording procedures or falls prevalence may differ. As with any study aimed at determining the performance characteristics of a testing methodology, this work is potentially subject to various biases of diagnostic accuracy. Incorporation and partial or differential verification biases are very unlikely based on our study design. However, our choice to use human review of ED provider notes as a gold standard may overestimate sensitivity of all methodologies if a significant number of falls were not mentioned by providers in their notes.12 Overall, our results suggest that analytic tools such as NLP should be rapidly adopted to improve the identification and appropriate treatment of falls in the ED. When NLP is unavailable, code-based definitions enhanced with CC data where possible may have acceptable performance depending on the use case. However, when using these strategies, their limitations should be recognized, especially the potential for coding-based strategies alone to underestimate the true burden of fall visits.

AB  - Despite rapid technological advances in healthcare, medicine is still largely practiced in a doctor’s office one conversation at a time. This reality is changing rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic as face-to-face conversations with primary care practitioners are being replaced by virtual visits conducted by phone or video conferencing. Communication challenges in patient-practitioner relationships exist in face-to-face visits and they are accentuated in virtual ones. Absent a physical examination and other sensory data, conversation is the primary means by which safe, satisfying care depends. We present 4 steps to help patients and practitioners work together to obtain optimal results from virtual or face-to-face visits, summarized by the acronym PREP: Prepare, Rehearse, Engage, and Persist. Based on 80 years of combined clinical practice and research, we recommend strategies to help bridge the gap between what patients want and deserve in their medical visits and practitioners’ understanding of their patients’ concerns.

AB  - Abstract Internet-based interventions for chronic pain have demonstrated efficacy and may address access barriers to care. Participant characteristics have been shown to affect engagement with these programs; however, limited information is available about the relationship between participant characteristics and engagement with internet-based programs for self-management of chronic pain. The current study examined relationships between demographic and clinical characteristics and engagement with the Pain EASE program, a self-directed, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for veterans with chronic low back pain (cLBP). Veterans with cLBP were enrolled in a 10 week trial of the Pain EASE program. Engagement measures included the number of logins, access to coping skill modules, and completed study staff-initiated weekly check-in calls. Regression analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of engagement from hypothesized predictors (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, depressive symptom severity, and pain interference). Participants (N = 58) were 93% male, 60.3% identified as White, and had a mean age of 54.5 years. Participants logged into the program a median of 3.5 times, accessed a median of 2 skill modules, and attended a median of 6 check-in calls. Quantile regression revealed that, at the 50th percentile, non-White-identified participants accessed fewer modules than White-identified participants (p = .019). Increased age was associated with increased module use (p = .001). No clinical characteristics were significantly associated with engagement measures. White-identified race/ethnicity and increased age were associated with greater engagement with the Pain EASE program. Results highlight the importance of defining and increasing engagement in internet-delivered pain care.

AB  - Abstract Objective Secure messaging has become an integrated function of patient portals, but misuse of secure messaging by both patients and clinicians can lead to miscommunication and errors, such as overlooked urgent messages. We sought to uncover variations in clinician approaches and responses to messaging with patients. Methods In this two-part study, 20 primary care clinicians (1) composed message responses to five hypothetical patient vignettes and messages and (2) were subsequently interviewed for their perspectives on appropriate circumstances for secure messaging. Messages and interviews were analyzed for themes. Results Clinicians have different experiences with, and perceptions of, secure messaging. The messages the clinicians wrote were uniformly respectful, but differed in degrees of patient-centeredness and level of detail. None of the clinicians found their messaging workload to be unmanageable. From the interviews, we found divergent clinician perspectives about when to use secure messaging and how to respond to emotional content. Conclusion Clinicians have different opinions about the appropriateness of secure messaging in response to specific medical issues. Our results noted a desire and need for greater guidance about secure messaging. This aspect of informatics education warrants greater attention in clinical practice. Practical implications We summarize the types of issues raised by the participants yet to be addressed by existing guidelines. Further guidance from hospitals, professional societies, and other institutions that govern clinician behavior on the appropriateness and effectiveness of delivering care through secure messaging may aid clinicians and patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Facilitation is a complex, relational implementation strategy that guides change processes. Facilitators engage in multiple activities and tailor efforts to local contexts. How this work is coordinated and shared among multiple, external actors and the contextual factors that prompt and moderate facilitators to tailor activities have not been well-described. Methods We conducted a mixed methods evaluation of a trial to improve the quality of transient ischemic attack care. Six sites in the Veterans Health Administration received external facilitation (EF) before and during a 1-year active implementation period. We examined how EF was employed and activated. Data analysis included prospective logs of facilitator correspondence with sites (160 site-directed episodes), stakeholder interviews (a total of 78 interviews, involving 42 unique individuals), and collaborative call debriefs ( n =22) spanning implementation stages. Logs were descriptively analyzed across facilitators, sites, time periods, and activity types. Interview transcripts were coded for content related to EF and themes were identified. Debriefs were reviewed to identify instances of and utilization of EF during site critical junctures. Results Multi-tiered EF was supported by two groups (site-facing quality improvement [QI] facilitators and the implementation support team) that were connected by feedback loops. Each site received an average of 24 episodes of site-directed EF; most of the EF was delivered by the QI nurse. For each site, site-directed EF frequently involved networking (45%), preparation and planning (44%), process monitoring (44%), and/or education (36%). EF less commonly involved audit and feedback (20%), brainstorming solutions (16%), and/or stakeholder engagement (5%). However, site-directed EF varied widely across sites and time periods in terms of these facilitation types. Site participants recognized the responsiveness of the QI nurse and valued her problem-solving, feedback, and accountability support. External facilitators used monitoring and dialogue to intervene by facilitating redirection during challenging periods of uncertainty about project direction and feasibility for sites. External facilitators, in collaboration with the implementation support team, successfully used strategies tailored to diverse local contexts, including networking, providing data, and brainstorming solutions. Conclusions Multi-tiered facilitation capitalizing on emergent feedback loops allowed for tailored, site-directed facilitation. Critical juncture cases illustrate the complexity of EF and the need to often try multiple strategies in combination to facilitate implementation progress. Trial registration The Protocol-guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurological Symptoms (PREVENT) is a registered trial ( NCT02769338 ), May 11, 2016—prospectively registered.

AB  - Abstract Background As telemedicine adoption increases, so does the importance of building cohesion among physicians in telemedicine teams. For example, in acute telestroke services, stroke specialists provide rapid remote stroke assessment and treatment to patients at hospitals without stroke specialty care. In the National Telestroke Program (NTSP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, a virtual (distributed) hub of stroke specialists throughout the country provides 24/7 consultations nationwide. We examined how these specialists adapted to distributed teamwork, and we identified cohesion-related factors in program development and support. Methods We studied the virtual hub of stroke specialists employed by the NTSP. Semi-structured, confidential interviews with stroke specialists in the virtual hub were recorded and transcribed. We explored the extent to which these specialists had developed a sense of shared identity and team cohesion, and we identified factors in this development. Using a qualitative approach with constant comparison methods, two researchers coded each interview transcript independently using a shared codebook. We used matrix displays to identify themes, with special attention to team cohesion, communication, trust, and satisfaction. Results Of 13 specialists with at least 8 months of NTSP practice, 12 completed interviews; 7 had previously practiced in telestroke programs in other healthcare systems. Interviewees reported high levels of trust and team cohesion, sometimes even more with their virtual colleagues than with co-located colleagues. Factors facilitating perceived team cohesion included a weekly case conference call, a sense of transparency in discussing challenges, engagement in NTSP development tasks, and support from the NTSP leadership. Although lack of in-person contact was associated with lower cohesion, annual in-person NTSP meetings helped mitigate this issue. Despite technical challenges in establishing a new telehealth system within existing national infrastructure, providers reported high levels of satisfaction with the NTSP. Conclusion A virtual telestroke hub can provide a sense of team cohesion among stroke specialists at a level comparable with a standard co-located practice. Engaging in transparent discussion of challenging cases, reviewing new clinical evidence, and contributing to program improvements may promote cohesion in distributed telemedicine teams.

AB  - Older adults are vulnerable to risks associated with medications. This study explores the roles of Social Workers in facilitating medication safety for older adults. Eight social workers from federally qualified health centers participated in a case-based and interactive medication safety curriculum. They participated in an in-depth, semi-structured interview to explore their roles and strategies in assisting older adults and caregivers with medication management. Findings were transcribed and analyzed. Six themes characterizing social workers’ roles in medication management were identified: a) Referral: matching patients and medication-related resources within the health-care system and community; b) Communication: connecting providers, patients, caregivers, and support system; c) Access to medicine: addressing unique needs of each patient to foster their ability to obtain their medicines; d) Social Determinants of Health: investigating the social challenges of each patient and facilitating specific medication management approaches to meet identified needs; e) Engagement: engaging patients in co-developing a treatment plan; f) Caregiver Support: preparing caregivers to assist in medication management. Social workers are trained and well positioned to provide a multi-faceted approach to improve medication management for older adults. Their unique perspectives and skills are important in addressing the complex challenges of medication management.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with oral anticoagulant undertreatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) among a cohort of rural patients with stroke outcomes and examine how undertreatment may influence a patient's one-year survival after stroke. Methods This retrospective cohort study examined ischemic stroke patients with pre-stroke AF diagnosis from September 2003 to May 2019 and divided them into proper treatment and undertreatment group. Analysis included chi-square test, variance analysis, Kruskal-Wallis test, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier estimator, and Cox proportional-hazards model. Results Out of 1062 ischemic stroke patients with a pre-stroke AF diagnosis, 1015 patients had a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2, and 532 (52.4%) of those were undertreated. Median time from AF diagnosis to index stroke was significantly lower among undertreated patients (1.9 years vs. 3.6 years, p < 0.001). Other thromboembolism, excluding stroke, TIA, and myocardial infarction (OR 0.41, p < 0.001), the number of encounters per year (OR 0.90, p < 0.001), and the median time between AF diagnosis and stroke event (OR 0.86, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with undertreatment. Kaplan-Meier estimator showed no statistical difference in the one-year survival probability between groups (log-rank test, p = 0.29), while the Cox-Hazard model showed that age (HR 1.05, p < 0.001) and history of congestive heart failure (HR 1.88, p < 0.001) increased the risk of mortality. Conclusions More than half of our rural stroke patients with a pre-index AF diagnosis were not on guideline-recommended treatment. The study highlights a large care gap and an opportunity to improve AF management.

AB  - Understanding how veterans use Veterans Affairs (VA) for primary care and non-VA for acute care can help policy makers predict future health care resource use. We aimed to describe characteristics of veterans enrolled in a multisite clinical trial of non-VA acute event notifications and care coordination and to identify patient factors associated with non-VA acute care.Characteristics of 565 veterans enrolled in a prospective cluster randomized trial at the Bronx and Indianapolis VA Medical Centers were obtained by interview and chart review.Veterans' mean age was 75.8 years old, 98.3% were male, and 39.2% self-identified as a minority race; 81.2% reported receiving the majority of care at the VA. There were 197 (34.9%) veterans for whom a non-VA acute care alert was received. Patient characteristics significantly associated with greater odds of a non-VA alert included older age (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.05); majority of care received is non-VA (OR = 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06-3.15); private insurance (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19-1.62); and higher income (OR = 4.01; 95% CI, 2.68-5.98).We identified several patient-level factors associated with non-VA acute care that can inform the design of VA services and policies for veterans with non-VA acute care encounters and reintegration back into the VA system.

AB  - Abstract Background Fatigue interference with activities, mood, and cognition is one of the most prevalent and bothersome concerns of advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients. As fatigue interferes with patient functioning, family caregivers often report feeling burdened by increasing responsibilities. Evidence-based interventions jointly addressing cancer patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden are lacking. In pilot studies, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has shown promise for addressing symptom-related suffering in cancer patients. The current pilot trial seeks to test a novel, dyadic ACT intervention for both advanced GI cancer patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue interference and their family caregivers with significant caregiving burden or distress. Methods A minimum of 40 patient-caregiver dyads will be randomly assigned to either the ACT intervention or an education/support control condition. Dyads in both conditions attend six weekly 50-min telephone sessions. Outcomes are assessed at baseline as well as 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. We will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of ACT for improving patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden. Secondary outcomes include patient sleep interference and patient and caregiver engagement in daily activities, psychological flexibility, and quality of life. We will also explore the effects of ACT on patient and caregiver physical and mental health service use. Discussion Findings will inform a large-scale trial of intervention efficacy. Results will also lay the groundwork for further novel applications of ACT to symptom interference with functioning and caregiver burden in advanced cancer.

AB  - Our goal was to determine the county-level effect of in-person primary and secondary school reopening on daily cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Indiana.In this county-level, population-based study, we used a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was 12 July 2020-6 October 2020. We included 73 of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollment statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100 000 residents at the county level.There is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest (β) is estimated at 3.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.91 to 4.81; P < .001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change in the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100 000 residents of all ages.In-person primary and secondary school is associated with a statistically significant but proportionally small increase in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

AB  - Copy number variation (CNV) is a major type of chromosomal structural variation that play important roles in many diseases including cancers. Due to genome instability, a large number of CNV events can be detected in diseases such as cancer. Therefore, it is important to identify the functionally important CNVs in diseases, which currently still poses a challenge in genomics. One of the critical steps to solve the problem is to define the influence of CNV. In this paper, we provide a topology potential based method, TPQCI, to quantify this kind of influence by integrating statistics, gene regulatory associations, and biological function information. We used this metric to detect functionally enriched genes on genomic segments with CNV in breast cancer and multiple myeloma and discovered biological functions influenced by CNV. Our results demonstrate that, by using our proposed TPQCI metric, we can detect disease-specific genes that are influenced by CNVs. Source codes of TPQCI are provided in Github (https://github.com/usos/TPQCI).

AB  - Between 30% and 80% of survivors of critical illness experience cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.To determine whether intensive care unit (ICU) delirium biomarkers align with the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework for diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer disease and other related dementias (ADRD).Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published between January 1, 2000, and February 20, 2020, on the relationship between delirium and biomarkers listed in the NIA-AA framework. Only studies that addressed delirium in the ICU setting and fluid biomarkers were included in these analyses.Of 61 256 records screened, 38 studies met inclusion criteria, 8 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. In pooled analysis, significant associations were found between ICU delirium and amyloid β-peptide 1-40 (standard mean difference [SMD], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.09-0.75), interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (SMD, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.21-0.94), and IL-6 (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-0.56). No significant association was observed in pooled analyses between ICU delirium and the other biomarkers. Few studies have examined ICU delirium and pathologic tau or neurodegeneration biomarkers.Inflammatory biomarkers and amyloid β are associated with ICU delirium and point to potential overlapping mechanisms between delirium and ADRD. Critical care providers should consider integrating diagnostic approaches used in ADRD in their assessment of post-ICU cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The aim of the study was to explore associations between active and receptive arts participation and all-cause mortality among adults in the United States population. This was a prospective cohort study. Data were derived from the Health and Retirement Study. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for two cohorts (2012 and 2014) to examine associations between arts participation and mortality. Independent of sociodemographic and health factors, participants aged ≥65 years had a higher mortality risk if they did not engage in music listening, hazard ratio (HR) 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–1.71); singing/playing an instrument, HR 1.49 (95% CI: 1.07–2.0); or doing arts and crafts, HR 1.39 (95% CI: 1.00–1.92). For participants aged <65 years, there was a higher mortality risk if they did not listen to music, HR 1.79 (95% CI: 1.07–3.01). Older participants from the 2014 cohort had a higher mortality risk if they did not engage in active arts, HR 1.73 (95% CI: 1.08–2.77). Engagement in the arts was associated with lower risk of mortality even after risk adjustment, especially for adults aged ≥65 years. Greater access and integration of arts in everyday life is recommended.

AB  - Goals-of-care communication (GOCC) is recommended to increase the value of cancer care near the end of life (EOL).Conduct a systematic review of the evidence that GOCC is associated with higher-value care.We searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMB Reviews, CINAHL, and PsycInfo from inception to July 2019. We analyzed the population,design, and results and the authors' definitions of GOCC. Risk of bias was assessed.Thirty-two articles were selected. Ten articles reported results from 8 interventions; 17 characterized participants' perspectives; and 5 were retrospective The topics, behaviors, timing, and anticipated outcomes of GOCC varied significantly and were indistinguishable from practices such as advance care planning. GOCC typically focused on treatment outcomes rather than patients' goals. Four of 5 interventions increased evidence of GOCC after clinician training. Only one reported improved patient outcomes.No consensus exists about what GOCC entails. There is limited evidence that GOCC increases the value of EOL care.Future studies should focus on how to engage patients in conversations about their personal goals and integrate their goals into care planning. Clinicians can encourage GOCC by explaining how patients' goals influence decisions especially as treatment options become limited.

AB  - Social support has been linked to more effective pain adaptation. The relationship between social support and other relevant constructs is less well understood. Chief among these is patient activation, which has robust links to effective self-management, yet has not been well studied in chronic pain. We sought to better understand these relationships in an effort to inform future intervention strategies for patients with chronic pain.Using baseline data from a clinical trial with patients with chronic pain (N = 213), we analyzed the relationships among perceived social support and patient activation, depression, anxiety, general health perceptions, pain centrality, pain catastrophizing, and pain intensity and interference. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the effect of social support on outcomes. Patient activation was explored as a mediator of the effect of social support on outcomes.Social support was significantly associated with all outcomes except pain. Social support explained the greatest variance in patient activation (squared semi-partial correlation = 0.081), followed by depression (0.073) and general health perceptions (0.072). Patient activation was not found to be a significant mediator of the effect of social support on pain-related outcomes.These findings provide insight into the roles of patient activation and social support in chronic pain management. Although patient activation did not mediate the relationship between social support and outcomes, this study is an important step toward gaining a more complete understanding of constructs thought to be related to pain self-management and points to the need to advance theory in this area to guide future research. Such work is needed to optimize interventions for patients with chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract Background Gene co-expression networks are widely studied in the biomedical field, with algorithms such as WGCNA and lmQCM having been developed to detect co-expressed modules. However, these algorithms have limitations such as insufficient granularity and unbalanced module size, which prevent full acquisition of knowledge from data mining. In addition, it is difficult to incorporate prior knowledge in current co-expression module detection algorithms. Results In this paper, we propose a novel module detection algorithm based on topology potential and spectral clustering algorithm to detect co-expressed modules in gene co-expression networks. By testing on TCGA data, our novel method can provide more complete coverage of genes, more balanced module size and finer granularity than current methods in detecting modules with significant overall survival difference. In addition, the proposed algorithm can identify modules by incorporating prior knowledge. Conclusion In summary, we developed a method to obtain as much as possible information from networks with increased input coverage and the ability to detect more size-balanced and granular modules. In addition, our method can integrate data from different sources. Our proposed method performs better than current methods with complete coverage of input genes and finer granularity. Moreover, this method is designed not only for gene co-expression networks but can also be applied to any general fully connected weighted network.

AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome caused by pathogenic germline variants (PGV) in any of the 4 DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, or deletions in EPCAM. LS leads to an increased risk of intestinal and extraintestinal cancers, of which colorectal and endometrial cancers are the most common. Individuals at risk for LS can be identified by using clinical criteria, prediction models, and universal tumor testing. Understanding each of these tools, including limitations and mimics of LS, is essential to the early identification of at-risk individuals.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The American Cancer Society, Inc. (ACS) estimates that 37,940 Indiana residents were diagnosed with cancer in 2020, which remains the leading cause of death in the state. Across the cancer continuum, national goals have been established targeting recommended benchmarks for states in prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship. Indiana consistently falls below most goals for each of these targeted categories. Methods To address these disparities, we implemented Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) as a virtual telehealth educational platform targeted at local healthcare providers. ECHO programs utilize a novel tele‐mentoring approach to the education of clinicians in a hub/spoke design. Sessions occurred twice monthly from September 2019 to September 2020 and consisted of a traditional didactic lecture and a case‐based discussion led by participating providers. Results During the pilot year there were a total of 22 ECHO sessions with 140 different participants. On average, 15.5 spokes attended each session with increasing participation at the end of the year. Post‐session surveys suggested generally favorable perception with 72% of respondents finding the quality “excellent.” Discussion Given the increasing rate of recurrent participation toward the end of the pilot year in conjunction with the favorable survey responses following each session, it was felt that the program was overall successful and warranted continued implementation. Conclusion The Project ECHO platform is a validated telehealth education platform that has the potential to impact cancer care at multiple points along the cancer continuum at the regional level.

AB  - Abstract Implementation evaluations have increasingly taken into account how features of local context help determine implementation outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine which contextual features of organizational capacity led directly to the RE-AIM Framework implementation outcomes of intervention reach and number of days taken to implement, in an implementation trial of a series of cancer education workshops conducted across 13 African-American churches in Maryland. We used a configurational approach with Coincidence Analysis to identify specific features of organizational capacity that uniquely distinguished churches with implementation success from those that were less successful. Aspects of organizational capacity (e.g., congregation size, staffing/volunteers, health ministry experience) were drawn from an existing measure of church organizational capacity for health promotion. Solution pathways leading to higher intervention reach included: having a health ministry in place for 1–4 years; or having fewer than 100 members; or mid-size churches that had conducted health promotion activities in 1–4 different topics in the past 2 years. Solution pathways to implementing the intervention in fewer number of days included: having conducted 1–2 health promotion activities in the past 2 years; having 1–5 part-time staff and a pastor without additional outside employment; or churches with a doctorally prepared pastor and a weekly attendance of 101–249 members. Study findings can inform future theory, research, and practice in implementation of evidence-based health promotion interventions delivered in faith-based and other limited-resource community settings. Findings support the important role of organizational capacity in implementation outcomes in these settings. Clinical trial registration The study was pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier: NCT02076958. Registered 3/4/2014. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02076958 .

AB  - Despite treatment advancements and improved survival, approximately 1800 children in the United States will die of cancer annually. Survival may depend on nonclinical factors, such as economic stability, neighborhood and built environment, health and health care, social and community context, and education, otherwise known as social determinants of health (SDoH). Extant literature reviews have linked socioeconomic status (SES) and race to disparate outcomes; however, these are not inclusive of all SDoH. Thus, we conducted a systematic review on associations between SDoH and survival in pediatric cancer patients. Of the 854 identified studies, 25 were included in this review. In addition to SES, poverty and insurance coverage were associated with survival. More studies that include other SDoH, such as social and community factors, utilize prospective designs, and conduct analyses with more precise SDoH measures are needed.

AB  - Systematically supporting caregiver-assisted medication management through IT interventions is a critical area of need toward improving outcomes for people living with ADRD and their caregivers, but a significant gap exists in the evidence base from which IT interventions to support caregivers' medication tasks can be built. User-centered design can address the user needs evidence gap and provide a scientific mechanism for developing IT interventions that meet caregivers' needs. The present study employs the three phases of user-centered design to address the first two stages of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development.We will conduct a three-phase study employing user-centered design techniques across three aims: Aim 1) assess the needs of ADRD caregivers who manage medications for people with ADRD (Stage 0); Aim 2) co-design a prototype IT intervention to support caregiver-assisted medication management collaboratively with ADRD caregivers (Stage IA); and Aim 3) feasibility test the prototype IT intervention with ADRD caregivers (Stage IB).Our user-centered design protocol provides a template for integrating the three phases of user-centered design to address the first two stages of the NIH Stage Model that can be used broadly by researchers who are developing IT interventions for ADRD caregivers.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrate the feasibility of predicting obesity using various machine learning techniques; however, these studies do not address the limitations of these methods in real-life settings where available data for children may vary. We investigated the medical history required for machine learning models to accurately predict body mass index (BMI) during early childhood. Within a longitudinal dataset of children ages 0–4 years, we developed predictive models based on long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network architecture, using history EHR data from 2 to 8 clinical encounters to estimate child BMI. We developed separate, sex-stratified models using 80% of the data for training and 20% for external validation. We evaluated model performance using K-fold cross-validation, mean average error (MAE), and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2). Two history encounters and a 4-month prediction yielded a high prediction error and low correlation between predicted and actual BMI (MAE of 1.60 for girls and 1.49 for boys). Model performance improved with additional history encounters; improvement was not significant beyond five history encounters. The combined model outperformed the sex-stratified models, with a MAE = 0.98 (SD 0.03) and R2 = 0.72. Our models show that five history encounters are sufficient to predict BMI prior to age 4 for both boys and girls. Moreover, starting from an initial dataset with more than 269 exposure variables, we were able to identify a limited set of 24 variables that can facilitate BMI prediction in early childhood. Nine of these final variables are collected once, and the remaining 15 need to be updated during each visit.

AB  - Mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) programs can facilitate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We sought to identify modifiable, clinic-level factors that distinguish primary care clinics with higher vs lower FIT completion rates in response to a centralized mailed FIT program.We used baseline observational data from 15 clinics within a single urban federally qualified health center participating in a pragmatic trial to optimize a mailed FIT program. Clinic-level data included interviews with leadership using a guide informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and FIT completion rates. We used template analysis to identify explanatory factors and configurational comparative methods to identify specific combinations of clinic-level conditions that uniquely distinguished clinics with higher and lower FIT completion rates.We interviewed 39 clinic leaders and identified 58 potential explanatory factors representing clinic workflows and the CFIR inner setting domain. Clinic-level FIT completion rates ranged from 30% to 56%. The configurational model for clinics with higher rates (≥37%) featured any 1 of the following 3 factors related to support staff: (1) adding back- or front-office staff in past 12 months, (2) having staff help patients resolve barriers to CRC screening, and (3) having staff hand out FITs/educate patients. The model for clinics with lower rates involved the combined absence of these same 3 factors.Three factors related to support staff differentiated clinics with higher and lower FIT completion rates. Adding nonphysician support staff and having those staff provide enabling services might help clinics optimize mailed FIT screening programs.

AB  - Despite known benefits, electronic health records (EHRs) have had drawbacks for daily practice and the physician experience. There is evidence that physicians practicing in solo or physician-owned practices are more likely to be satisfied with the EHR and experience lower burnout than those practicing in other ownership arrangements; however, it is unclear how practice ownership patterns interact with physicians' experiences with the EHR and documentation in the EHR now that use of these systems is widespread.To examine the association between practice ownership and physician perceptions of the EHR.This cross-sectional study included non-federally employed physicians who provided office-based patient care in 2019 and completed the 2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey. The 2019 survey sample consisted of 1524 eligible responses (41.0% unweighted response rate representing 301 603 physicians); of those, 1368 physicians who reported having an EHR and answered questions regarding location ownership were included in the analysis. Data for the 2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey were collected by RTI International from June 14 to December 11, 2019; the current cross-sectional analysis was conducted from October 1 to November 30, 2021.Satisfaction with the EHR, perceptions of time spent on clinical documentation, and presence of staff support for documentation.Among 1368 respondents (weighted, 270 813 respondents) included in the analysis, 960 respondents (weighted: 185,385 respondents [68.5%]) were male, and 951 respondents (weighted: 200,622 respondents [74.1%]) were over 50 years of age; 766 respondents (weighted, 161 226 respondents [59.5%]) were working in a practice owned by a physician or physician group, and 700 respondents (weighted, 131 284 respondents [48.5%]) were primary care physicians. A total of 602 respondents (weighted, 109 587 physicians [40.5%]) were working in a non-physician-owned practice. Overall, 529 respondents (weighted, 108 093 respondents [68.1%]) working in physician-owned practices reported being satisfied with their EHR vs 320 respondents (weighted, 63 988 respondents [58.5%]) working in non-physician-owned practices (P = .03). Among those working in physician-owned practices, perceptions that time spent on documentation was appropriate (328 physicians [weighted, 71 827 physicians (44.8%)] vs 191 physicians [weighted, 35 447 physicians (32.4%)]; P = .005) and that staff support for documentation was available (289 physicians [weighted, 57 702 physicians (36.0%)] vs 146 physicians [weighted, 29 267 physicians (26.7%)]; P = .02) were significantly higher compared with those working in non-physician-owned practices. Physicians' perceptions of the appropriateness of time spent and the availability of staff support only partially explained the association between practice ownership type and EHR satisfaction.The results of this nationally representative cross-sectional study suggest that physicians working in physician-owned practices are more likely to be satisfied with the EHR, to have positive perceptions of time spent on documentation, and to have staff support for documentation compared with their counterparts working in non-physician-owned practices. The workflow and cultural forces underlying these differences are important to understand in the setting of known differences in burnout by practice ownership type and ongoing physician group consolidation and acquisition by health care systems.

AB  - In her article in this month's Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Mary Tinetti offers a twofold prescription to save geriatrics from extinction: better define who we are to the public and aggressively sell our accomplishments.1 Tinetti's article continues a decades-long debate about the identity of the field and its role in health care. Below is a brief historical synopsis of this debate and a discussion of Tinetti's proposed solutions. Modern American geriatrics effectively began in the 1980s. Establishment of the National Institute on Aging, which was designed to make aging an academic discipline, and the Department of Veterans Affairs response to the accelerated aging of its population catalyzed its inception. From the outset, several paths were proposed, and geriatrics began a long and ongoing struggle to determine its principal role. Proposed roles have included geriatric medicine as a specialty, a primary care discipline, or a largely academic enterprise that would “gerontologize” other practice disciplines.2 The promoted clinical realm of geriatrics publicly wavered between primary care3 and specialty care.4 Some called for recasting geriatrics as chronic disease care expertise.5 In 2005, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Task Force on the Future of Geriatric Medicine, of which Dr. Tinetti was a member, identified five goals for the field: ensuring high-quality care for older adults, expanding the geriatrics knowledge base, increasing the number of healthcare professionals employing geriatrics principles, increasing the number of geriatricians and other geriatrics providers, and advocating for better public policy to serve older adults.6 In 2012, the Editor-In-Chief of JAGS called for a focus on care of the oldest old.7 Recently, Friedman, Shah, and Hall called for expanding the field's landscape to include healthy aging.8 This panoply of goals reminds us of Stephen Leacock's hero who “flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.”9 Is geriatrics a force for gerontologizing health care or a distinct practice? Tinetti suggests this is the wrong question. Geriatrics is a metadiscipline that “transcends and informs all other disciplines.” It is essentially the merger of gerontological principles and methods of effective chronic care. Tinetti calls for geriatricians to brand themselves as the experts in complex chronic care, especially multimorbidity, offering critical prototypes for the kind of care needed today. These are useful concepts for reframing geriatrics, and the AGS has pursued them to some extent in rebranding activities for the discipline, yet as Tinetti correctly asserts, geriatrics has still “failed to provide a single, consistent, and unified understanding of who we are and what we do.” We need to forge a unified identity that all geriatricians and the rest of the world can succinctly describe and value. Perhaps it is time for the AGS to take on this task definitively, preferably with the participation of colleagues from the Gerontological Society of America, the American Medical Directors Association, the Society for Post-Acute and Long Term Care Medicine, and the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Nevertheless, according to Tinetti's thoughtful piece, reframing our identity is only a first step in saving geriatrics. Building on her falls experience, she urges the field to more-aggressively market itself and sell its own successes. The field of geriatrics has developed useful tools and approaches for managing complex problems, beginning with geriatric assessment and management.10 More recently, it has created a number of approaches to coordinating care for the most challenging cases, namely those with multimorbidty, who use a disproportionate amount of resources (e.g., Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders,11, 12 Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly,13 transitional care14, 15). Caring for this population is a pressing social problem, as the extensive investment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation indicates.16 Tinetti points out that a number of the above approaches are being implemented in healthcare settings, stimulated by the growth of alternate payment models. A critical marketing strategy for geriatrics and chronic care management involves selling a consistent product and developing a simple message around a set of principles, be that a core curriculum or an approach to coordinated care. Selling essentially the same thing under different names (and acronyms) creates confusion. Tinetti correctly asserts that the models we are marketing in a limited fashion are paradoxically undermining marketing efforts because, although they all have essentially the same components, each project is promoted as unique. One of her sensible recommendations is to boil down these models (clinical approaches and didactics) to a consistent set of principles. Tinetti's proposal raises critical implications for the geriatrician's role in clinical care, research, outreach, policy, and education. Complex chronic care is not limited to older adults, and some see rebranding in this direction as a step away from our core population, yet this is exactly what many healthcare leaders request—if it works for complex older adults, then why not provide it for complex younger individuals? Academic geriatric medicine can point to a wealth of observational and experimental research that describes the care needs of complex patients and presents data on new models of care,17 but developing and testing these models is altogether different from implementing and selling them. Although some would urge caution until more-persuasive evidence of effectiveness is generated,18 others argue that the overwhelming logic of the solutions and the huge need necessitates action now.19 More importantly, the time has perhaps come for us to be better listeners as well as better activists in our own healthcare systems. Rebranding ourselves for ourselves does not work, as our history shows. We need a new strategy focused on engaging the people who actually determine our value and embracing the reality that value encompasses economic considerations as judged by the marketplace. We also need to learn how and why older adults might demand competent geriatric care. This demand cannot be met with geriatric medicine specialists, but as Tinetti suggests, geriatric medicine specialists might design and monitor a competent geriatric healthcare system. They must also allocate more time to shaping healthcare policy. We need to actively support efforts to align policy with the health realities of older adults today. The limited geriatrician workforce might be better allocated to executive suites or Capitol Hill than in the clinical trenches. Certainly one of the more-controversial implications of Dr. Tinetti's prescription is scrapping the goal of expanding the number of geriatricians and geriatrics health providers, one of the five goals set out in the AGS 2005 Future of Geriatric Medicine publication.6 The oft-lamented geriatrician shortage—a problem that we have created and defined—has been the source of endless rumination and considerable rancor over the past 3 decades. Numerous laudable solutions have been tried, including a shortened fellowship duration, congressional lobbying, loan forgiveness, and tens of millions of dollars of support for geriatrics education and workforce development from the Reynolds Foundation and the John A. Hartford Foundation, Inc. None has solved the problem of an inadequate geriatric workforce. We need to come to grips with this reality. In other countries, when geriatricians receive salaries comparable with those of other specialists, there has been a marked increase in interest in becoming geriatricians. We strongly urge that geriatricians in the United States receive appropriate reimbursement but recognize that Tinetti's concept of geriatrics as primarily a “small elite training force” may be the way of the future. If we follow that path, we will need an adequate supply of primary care clinicians whose skills can be enhanced to provide high-quality care for older adults, particularly those who are complex and frail. What better field to lead the way in this task than geriatrics? An initiative such as the Health Resources and Service Administration–funded Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) could provide another shot at gerontologizing primary care providers. The extensive involvement of geriatrics professionals in leading the initial set of GWEP sites and the central role of the AGS serving as the center for coordinating their work (through funding from the John A. Hartford Foundation) is encouraging. Achieving consensus on a concise description of geriatrics, the extent of its successes, the roles of its professionals, and its future strategic direction is difficult work. That difficulty is reflected in the differing points of view the authors of this commentary experienced while writing it, but now more than ever, the field of geriatrics—a small but demographically important force in health care—needs to further burnish and focus its goal of promoting better care of the complex older adult population. Tinetti's article provides a starting blueprint for how to accomplish that. Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no competing interests to report.

AB  - Abstract Background COVID-19 infection has disproportionately affected socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. Despite this disproportionate burden of infection, these neighborhoods have also lagged in COVID-19 vaccinations. To date, we have little understanding of the ways that various types of social conditions intersect to explain the complex causes of lower COVID-19 vaccination rates in neighborhoods. Methods We used configurational comparative methods (CCMs) to study COVID-19 vaccination rates in Philadelphia by neighborhood (proxied by zip code tabulation areas). Specifically, we identified neighborhoods where COVID-19 vaccination rates (per 10,000) were persistently low from March 2021 – May 2021. We then assessed how different combinations of social conditions (pathways) uniquely distinguished neighborhoods with persistently low vaccination rates from the other neighborhoods in the city. Social conditions included measures of economic inequities, racial segregation, education, overcrowding, service employment, public transit use, health insurance and limited English proficiency. Results Two factors consistently distinguished neighborhoods with persistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates from the others: college education and concentrated racial privilege. Two factor values together – low college education AND low/medium concentrated racial privilege – identified persistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates in neighborhoods, with high consistency (0.92) and high coverage (0.86). Different values for education and concentrated racial privilege – medium/high college education OR high concentrated racial privilege – were each sufficient by themselves to explain neighborhoods where COVID-19 vaccination rates were not persistently low, likewise with high consistency (0.93) and high coverage (0.97). Conclusions Pairing CCMs with geospatial mapping can help identify complex relationships between social conditions linked to low COVID-19 vaccination rates. Understanding how neighborhood conditions combine to create inequities in communities could inform the design of interventions tailored to address COVID-19 vaccination disparities.

AB  - Background: Fluctuations in health among chronically ill adults result in frequent health care transitions. Some interventions to improve patient outcomes after hospitalization include caregiver engagement as a core component, yet there is unclear evidence of the effects of this component on outcomes. Objective: The objective of this study was to synthesize evidence regarding the attention given to caregiver engagement in randomized control trials of transitional care interventions (TCIs), estimate the overall intervention effects, and assess caregiver engagement as a moderator of intervention effects. Methods: Three databases were systematically searched for randomized control trials of TCIs targeting adults living with physical or emotional chronic diseases. For the meta-analysis, overall effects were computed using the relative risk (RR) effect size and inverse variance weighting. Results: Fifty-four studies met criteria, representing 31,291 participants and 66 rehospitalizations effect sizes. Half (51%) the interventions lacked focus on caregiver engagement. The overall effect of TCIs on all-cause rehospitalizations was nonsignificant at 1 month ( P =0.107, k =29), but significant at ≥2 months [RR=0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 0.97; P =0.007, k =27]. Caregiver engagement moderated intervention effects ( P =0.05), where interventions with caregiver engagement reduced rehospitalizations (RR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.92; P =0.001), and those without, did not (RR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.08; P =0.550). Interventions with and without caregiver engagement did not differ in the average number of components utilized, however, interventions with caregiver engagement more commonly employed baseline needs assessments ( P =0.032), discharge planning ( P =0.006), and service coordination ( P =0.035). Discussion: Future TCIs must consistently incorporate the active participation of caregivers in design, delivery, and evaluation.

AB  - Blood biomarkers can offer valuable and easily accessible indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic conditions, and responses to therapeutic interventions. Recent studies found that levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the blood are associated with mortality in three European cohorts of older adults (median ages 73, 93, and 100 years). Whether similar associations exist in younger adults and in other ethnic groups is currently not known.We utilized a cohort study that included 294 African Americans (baseline ages 49-65). Serum NfL levels were measured using a Meso Scale Discovery-based assay. Vital status was determined by matching through the National Death Index.Seventy-two participants (24.5%) died during the 14-15 years of follow up (2000-2014). Baseline serum NfL levels were significantly higher in the decedent group (86.1±65.7 pg/ml vs. 50.1±28.0 pg/ml, p < 0·001). In binomial logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, baseline smoking status, BMI, and total comorbidities (0-11), serum NfL levels remained a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, and sensitivity analyses employing multiple additional covariates did not substantively change the relationship. Further, Kaplan-Meier curves based on serum NfL quartiles showed reduced survival in groups with higher serum NfL levels.This study found a positive association between serum NfL levels and mortality in late middle-aged and older individuals. While our findings support that serum NfL levels may be a useful biomarker for all-cause mortality, further studies are needed to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this association.National Institute on Aging, Saint Louis University.

AB  - Delirium is a highly prevalent and morbid syndrome in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Music is a promising non-pharmacological intervention with beneficial effects on anxiety and stress, while its effects on delirium duration and severity are not well understood.Our study is a two-arm, randomized parallel-group, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of music intervention compared to a silence-track attention control on delirium/coma duration in mechanically ventilated critically ill older adults. One hundred sixty mechanically ventilated adults 50 years of age or older will be randomized to one of two arms within 72 h of ICU admission: (1) 1-h music listening sessions twice daily through noise-canceling headphones, or (2) 1-h sessions of a silence track twice daily through noise-canceling headphones. Our primary aim is to compare delirium/coma-free days after randomization during the 7-day study intervention phase using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM ICU) and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) for delirium and coma. Secondary outcomes include pain and anxiety evaluated twice daily during the intervention phase and throughout the duration of ICU stay using the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and visual analog scale-anxiety (VAS-A). Enrolled participants will be followed after hospital discharge to further measure cognition as well as screening for depression and anxiety using the following telephone-based instruments: Indiana University Telephone-Based Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (IU TBANS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7).This randomized clinical trial will measure the efficacy of a music listening intervention for delirium and coma duration early in the intensive care unit among older adults.ClinicalTrials.gov.

Many women who receive antenatal corticosteroids for threatened preterm labor proceed to deliver at term. Thus, long-term outcomes should be evaluated for term-born infants who were exposed to antenatal corticosteroids in utero.This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes between term-born children aged ≥5 years who were born to women who received antenatal corticosteroids for threatened preterm labor and children whose mothers were also evaluated for threatened preterm labor but did not receive antenatal corticosteroids.We performed a retrospective cohort study of children born at ≥37 weeks' gestation, aged ≥5 years, and born to mothers diagnosed with threatened preterm labor during pregnancy. The primary exposure of interest was receiving antenatal corticosteroids. Among the collected childhood medical conditions, the primary outcome of interest was a diagnosis of asthma.Of the 3556 term-born children aged ≥5 years, 629 (17.6%) were exposed to antenatal corticosteroids (all betamethasone), and 2927 (82.3%) were controls whose mothers were evaluated for threatened preterm birth but did not get antenatal corticosteroid injections. Women receiving antenatal corticosteroids had higher rates of maternal comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension; P≤.01). Antenatal corticosteroid-exposed children had no difference in diagnosis of asthma (12.6% vs 11.6%), attention deficit disorder, or developmental delay (P=.47, .54, and .10, respectively). Controlling for maternal and neonatal characteristics, asthma was not different between those exposed to antenatal corticosteroids and controls (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.39). The odds of the child's weight percentile being <10% were increased for antenatal corticosteroid-exposed children born at term (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.25).Children born at term who were exposed to antenatal corticosteroids may have increased odds of being in a lower growth percentile than those not exposed. However, rates of diagnoses such as asthma, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorders were not different.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this article is to compare the aims, measures, methods, limitations, and scope of studies that employ vendor-derived and investigator-derived measures of electronic health record (EHR) use, and to assess measure consistency across studies. Materials and Methods We searched PubMed for articles published between July 2019 and December 2021 that employed measures of EHR use derived from EHR event logs. We coded the aims, measures, methods, limitations, and scope of each article and compared articles employing vendor-derived and investigator-derived measures. Results One hundred and two articles met inclusion criteria; 40 employed vendor-derived measures, 61 employed investigator-derived measures, and 1 employed both. Studies employing vendor-derived measures were more likely than those employing investigator-derived measures to observe EHR use only in ambulatory settings (83% vs 48%, P = .002) and only by physicians or advanced practice providers (100% vs 54% of studies, P &amp;lt; .001). Studies employing vendor-derived measures were also more likely to measure durations of EHR use (P &amp;lt; .001 for 6 different activities), but definitions of measures such as time outside scheduled hours varied widely. Eight articles reported measure validation. The reported limitations of vendor-derived measures included measure transparency and availability for certain clinical settings and roles. Discussion Vendor-derived measures are increasingly used to study EHR use, but only by certain clinical roles. Although poorly validated and variously defined, both vendor- and investigator-derived measures of EHR time are widely reported. Conclusion The number of studies using event logs to observe EHR use continues to grow, but with inconsistent measure definitions and significant differences between studies that employ vendor-derived and investigator-derived measures.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis, and vaccines are the most effective means of preventing severe consequences of this disease. Hesitancy regarding vaccines persists among adults in the United States, despite overwhelming scientific evidence of safety and efficacy.The purpose of this study was to use the Health Belief Model (HBM) and reasoned action approach (RAA) to examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by comparing those who had already received 1 vaccine to those who had received none.This study examined demographic and theory-based factors associated with vaccine uptake and intention among 1643 adults in the United States who completed an online survey during February and March 2021. Survey items included demographic variables (eg, age, sex, political ideology), attitudes, and health belief variables (eg, perceived self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility). Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used for vaccine uptake/intent. The first model included demographic variables. The second model added theory-based factors to examine the association of health beliefs and vaccine uptake above and beyond the associations explained by demographic characteristics alone.The majority of participants were male (n=974, 59.3%), White (n=1347, 82.0%), and non-Hispanic (n=1518, 92.4%) and reported they had already received a COVID-19 vaccine or definitely would when it was available to them (n=1306, 79.5%). Demographic variables significantly associated with vaccine uptake/intent included age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06), other race (AOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.83 vs White), and political ideology (AOR 15.77, 95% CI 7.03-35.35 very liberal vs very conservative). The theory-based factors most strongly associated with uptake/intention were attitudes (AOR 3.72, 95% CI 2.42-5.73), self-efficacy (AOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34-2.29), and concerns about side effects (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.76). Although race and political ideology were significant in the model of demographic characteristics, they were not significant when controlling for attitudes and beliefs.Vaccination represents one of the best tools to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other possible pandemics in the future. This study showed that older age, attitudes, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy are positively associated with vaccine uptake and intent, whereas perceived side effects and lack of trust in the vaccine are associated with lower uptake and intent. Race and political ideology were not significant predictors when attitudes and beliefs were considered. Before vaccine hesitancy can be addressed, researchers and clinicians must understand the basis of vaccine hesitancy and which populations may show higher hesitancy to the vaccination so that interventions can be adequately targeted.

AB  - Understanding the current state of real-world Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) applications (apps) will benefit biomedical research and clinical care and facilitate advancement of the standard. This study aimed to provide a preliminary assessment of these apps' clinical, technical, and implementation characteristics.We searched public repositories for potentially eligible FHIR apps and surveyed app implementers and other stakeholders.Of the 112 apps surveyed, most focused on clinical care (74) or research (45); were implemented across multiple sites (56); and used SMART-on-FHIR (55) and FHIR version R4 (69). Apps were primarily stand-alone web-based (67) or electronic health record (EHR)-embedded (51), although 49 were not listed in an EHR app gallery.Though limited in scope, our results show FHIR apps encompass various domains and characteristics.As FHIR use expands, this study-one of the first to characterize FHIR apps at large-highlights the need for systematic, comprehensive methods to assess their characteristics.

AB  - To analyze how physician clinical note length and composition relate to electronic health record (EHR)-based measures of burden and efficiency that have been tied to burnout.Secondary EHR use metadata capturing physician-level measures from 203,728 US-based ambulatory physicians using the Epic Systems EHR between September 2020 and May 2021.In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed physician clinical note length and note composition (e.g., content from manual or templated text). Our primary outcomes were three time-based measures of EHR burden (time writing EHR notes, time in the EHR after-hours, and EHR time on unscheduled days), and one measure of efficiency (percent of visits closed in the same day). We used multivariate regression to estimate the relationship between our outcomes and note length and composition.Physician-week measures of EHR usage were extracted from Epic's Signal platform used for measuring provider EHR efficiency. We calculated physician-level averages for our measures of interest and assigned physicians to overall note length deciles and note composition deciles from six sources, including templated text, manual text, and copy/paste text.Physicians in the top decile of note length demonstrated greater burden and lower efficiency than the median physician, spending 39% more time in the EHR after hours (p < 0.001) and closing 5.6 percentage points fewer visits on the same day (p < 0.001). Copy/paste demonstrated a similar dose/response relationship, with top-decile copy/paste users closing 6.8 percentage points fewer visits on the same day (p < 0.001) and spending more time in the EHR after hours and on days off (both p < 0.001). Templated text (e.g., Epic's SmartTools) demonstrated a non-linear relationship with burden and efficiency, with very low and very high levels of use associated with increased EHR burden and decreased efficiency."Efficiency tools" like copy/paste and templated text meant to reduce documentation burden and increase provider efficiency may have limited efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Maternal and pediatric populations have historically been considered “therapeutic orphans” due to their limited inclusion in clinical trials. Physiologic changes during pregnancy and lactation and growth and maturation of children alter pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of drugs. Precision therapy in these populations requires knowledge of these effects. Efforts to enhance maternal and pediatric participation in clinical studies have increased over the past few decades. However, studies supporting precision therapeutics in these populations are often small and, in isolation, may have limited impact. Integration of data from various studies, for example through physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) modeling or bioinformatics approaches, can augment the value of data from these studies, and help identify gaps in understanding. To catalyze research in maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics, the Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Maternal and Pediatric Precision in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub. Herein, we provide an overview of the status of maternal–pediatric therapeutics research and introduce the Indiana University‐Ohio State University MPRINT Hub Data, Model, Knowledge and Research Coordination Center (DMKRCC), which aims to facilitate research in maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics through the integration and assessment of existing knowledge, supporting pharmacometrics and clinical trials design, development of new real‐world evidence resources, educational initiatives, and building collaborations among public and private partners, including other NICHD‐funded networks. By fostering use of existing data and resources, the DMKRCC will identify critical gaps in knowledge and support efforts to overcome these gaps to enhance maternal–pediatric precision therapeutics.

AB  - Research objectives: Nationally sponsored cancer-care quality-improvement efforts have been deployed in community health centers to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-screening rates among vulnerable populations. Despite several immediate and short-term gains, screening rates remain below national benchmark objectives. Overall improvement has been both difficult to sustain over time in some organizational settings and/or challenging to diffuse to other settings as repeatable best practices. Reasons for this include facility-level changes, which typically occur in dynamic organizational environments that are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. This study seeks to understand the factors that shape community health center facility-level cancer-screening performance over time. This study applies a computational-modeling approach, combining principles of health-services research, health informatics, network theory, and systems science. Methods: To investigate the roles of knowledge acquisition, retention, and sharing within the setting of the community health center and to examine their effects on the relationship between clinical decision support capabilities and improvement in cancer-screening rate improvement, we employed Construct-TM to create simulated community health centers using previously collected point-in-time survey data. Construct-TM is a multi-agent model of network evolution. Because social, knowledge, and belief networks co-evolve, groups and organizations are treated as complex systems to capture the variability of human and organizational factors. In Construct-TM, individuals and groups interact by communicating, learning, and making decisions in a continuous cycle. Data from the survey was used to differentiate high-performing simulated community health centers from low-performing ones based on computer-based decision support usage and self-reported cancer-screening improvement. Results: This virtual experiment revealed that patterns of overall network symmetry, agent cohesion, and connectedness varied by community health center performance level. Visual assessment of both the agent-to-agent knowledge sharing network and agent-to-resource knowledge use network diagrams demonstrated that community health centers labeled as high performers typically showed higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness among agent classes, faster knowledge-absorption rates, and fewer agents that were unconnected to key knowledge resources. Conclusions and research implications: Using the point-in-time survey data outlining community health center cancer-screening practices, our computational model successfully distinguished between high and low performers. Results indicated that high-performance environments displayed distinctive network characteristics in patterns of interaction among agents, as well as in the access and utilization of key knowledge resources. Our study demonstrated how non-network-specific data obtained from a point-in-time survey can be employed to forecast community health center performance over time, thereby enhancing the sustainability of long-term strategic-improvement efforts. Our results revealed a strategic profile for community health center cancer-screening improvement via simulation over a projected 10-year period. The use of computational modeling allows additional inferential knowledge to be drawn from existing data when examining organizational performance in increasingly complex environments.

AB  - Abstract Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Depression has complex bidirectional adverse associations with CAD, although the mechanisms mediating these relationships remain unclear. Compared to European Americans, African Americans (AAs) have higher rates of morbidity and mortality from CAD. Although depression is common in AAs, its role in the development and features of CAD in this group has not been well examined. This project hypothesizes that the relationships between depression and CAD can be explained by common physiological pathways and gene-environment interactions. Thus, the primary aims of this ongoing project are to: a) determine the prevalence of CAD and depression phenotypes in a population-based sample of community-dwelling older AAs; b) examine the relationships between CAD and depression phenotypes in this population; and c) evaluate genetic variants from serotoninP and inflammatory pathways to discover potential gene-depression interactions that contribute significantly to the presence of CAD in AAs. Methods/design The St. Louis African American Health (AAH) cohort is a population-based panel study of community-dwelling AAs born in 1936–1950 (inclusive) who have been followed from 2000/2001 through 2010. The AAH-Heart study group is a subset of AAH participants recruited in 2009–11 to examine the inter-relationships between depression and CAD in this population. State-of-the-art CAD phenotyping is based on cardiovascular characterizations (coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, cardiac structure and function, and autonomic function). Depression phenotyping is based on standardized questionnaires and detailed interviews. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of selected genes in inflammatory and serotonin-signaling pathways are being examined to provide information for investigating potential gene-depression interactions as modifiers of CAD traits. Information from the parent AAH study is being used to provide population-based prevalence estimates. Inflammatory and other biomarkers provide information about potential pathways. Discussion This population-based investigation will provide valuable information on the prevalence of both depression and CAD phenotypes in this population. The study will examine interactions between depression and genetic variants as modulators of CAD, with the intent of detecting mechanistic pathways linking these diseases to identify potential therapeutic targets. Analytic results will be reported as they become available.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. To facilitate the efficiency of colorectal cancer screening, there is a need to stratify risk for colorectal cancer among the 90% of US residents who are considered "average risk." In this article, we investigate such risk stratification rules for advanced colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer and advanced, precancerous polyps). We use a recently completed large cohort study of subjects who underwent a first screening colonoscopy. Logistic regression models have been used in the literature to estimate the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia based on quantifiable risk factors. However, logistic regression may be prone to overfitting and instability in variable selection. Since most of the risk factors in our study have several categories, it was tempting to collapse these categories into fewer risk groups. We propose a penalized logistic regression method that automatically and simultaneously selects variables, groups categories, and estimates their coefficients by penalizing the [Formula: see text]-norm of both the coefficients and their differences. Hence, it encourages sparsity in the categories, i.e. grouping of the categories, and sparsity in the variables, i.e. variable selection. We apply the penalized logistic regression method to our data. The important variables are selected, with close categories simultaneously grouped, by penalized regression models with and without the interactions terms. The models are validated with 10-fold cross-validation. The receiver operating characteristic curves of the penalized regression models dominate the receiver operating characteristic curve of naive logistic regressions, indicating a superior discriminative performance.

AB  - “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”– Albert Einstein Data to support adenoma detection rate (ADR) as a measure of colonoscopy quality and cancer protection continue to emerge,1Corley D.A.

Marks A.R. et al.Adenoma detection rate and risk of colorectal cancer and death.N Engl J Med. 2014; 370: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar along with evidence that behavior changes favorably when ADR is tracked.2Kahi C.J. Ballard D. Shah A.S. et al.Impact of a quarterly report card on colonoscopy quality measures.Gastrointest Endosc. 2013; 77: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar However, ADR can be a challenging metric to obtain, given the disparity in systems for pairing colonoscopy and pathology reports. Although several surrogate measures have been suggested as appropriate for quantifying quality (eg, ADR, polypectomy rate), the potential for gaming the system makes them less attractive,3Wang H.S.

Modi R. et al.Adenoma detection rate is necessary but insufficient for distinguishing high versus low endoscopist performance.Gastrointest Endosc. 2013; 77: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar implying that the easiest metrics to count may not be the most useful ones. What is needed are 1 or more robust quality measures and an automated, accurate method for obtaining them. The mean number of adenomas per screening colonoscopy has been proposed as less prone to gaming than the ADR, but no data have linked this measure to outcomes.4Kahi C.J. Vemulapalli K.C.

Since 2011, several institutions have developed customized in-house automated systems for quantifying ADR, advanced ADR, and site-specific ADR (proximal/distal), precluding the need for manual review. As providers of an effective but expensive and invasive technology, we endoscopists will soon be required to quantify colonoscopy quality for payers.5Rex D.K. Schoenfeld P.S. Cohen J. et al.Quality indicators for colonoscopy.Gastrointest Endosc. 2015; 81: 31-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar Although the potential for a system that uses artificial intelligence to track our services is no longer considered far-fetched, this vision must be tempered with consideration of what and how a metric is to be measured. There is a pressing need for a simple, yet accurate, method for moving toward an optimal system of tracking colonoscopy quality.Table 1Summary of selected studies using natural language processing–based extraction of adenoma detection rateStudyObjectivesMethodsResultsADRWhat the study addsHarkema et al (2011)7Harkema H.

Multi-center colonoscopy quality measurement utilizing natural language processing. Am J Gastroenterol. Epub 2015 Mar 10.Google Scholar First, there appears to have been no differentiation between a training set and a test set, which increases both the potential for overtraining and the chance of less accurate performance when the method is applied to subsequent patient cohorts. Second, because traditional NLP was not used, the CAADRR system is unable to use context-specific term identification. As a result, the phrase “no … adenoma” would potentially count as an adenoma by the CAADRR system, whereas it would be recognized as a negated term by a complex NLP system; the misspelled word “adnoma” would be potentially missed with CAADRR but identified by NLP. Third, the CAADRR system has no method for finding adenomas 10 mm or larger, omitting the inclusion of this large subgroup of advanced adenomas from specific identification. The number of adenomas per colonoscopy, which may be a better quality metric than ADR, is also not possible to quantify in the CAADRR system. Furthermore, the accuracy of identifying a “screening” colonoscopy may be questioned because patients with rectal bleeding and a positive fecal blood test result were counted as “screening,” whereas those with “family history of colorectal cancer” were excluded without specifically being first-degree relatives. Last, this is a single-center tool that was created on templated endoscopy software with a single pathology reporting system. Although the tool may work well on its “home court,” the methods used to create it may not apply as well to other systems. Despite advances made by several groups of investigators in automated measuring of selected quality determinations (Table 1), there are and will likely remain several other determinants of colonoscopy quality that are not reflected in procedure note documentation. These include adequacy of luminal distention and examining the proximal sides of flexures, folds, and valves—techniques associated with lower adenoma miss rates.11Rex D.K. Colonoscopic withdrawal technique is associated with adenoma miss rates.Gastrointest Endosc. 2000; 51: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar Although video recording of colonoscopies and randomly reviewing withdrawal techniques is a possibility,12Rex D.K.

In 2015, technology pervades our professional life, with each clinical encounter systematically logged into the electronic medical record. The opportunity to use secondary data to improve the quality of health services and patient outcomes is apparent. However, we must temper our enthusiasm with reality. We must accept that not all patients for a provider or panels of patients among providers are the same. For example, a quality metric such as ADR must be coupled with adjustment for factors that affect risk for colorectal neoplasia (eg, age, gender, certain family histories, results of previous screening tests). An adjusted ADR would appropriately reduce unwanted variations caused by these factors, resulting in a better quality metric. Furthermore, today’s best quality metric may not be tomorrow’s. Mean adenoma number per screening colonoscopy may be a more robust, more “tamperproof” metric,13Denis B. Sauleau E.A. Gendre I. et al.The mean number of adenomas per procedure should become the gold standard to measure the neoplasia yield of colonoscopy: a population-based cohort study.Dig Liver Dis. 2014; 46: 176-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar so any technology used for quality monitoring must be adaptable to changing measures of quality. With the challenge of detecting SSPs, an SSP detection rate may be most indicative of high-quality colonoscopy, although variations in pathologic interpretation must be addressed definitively before further study.14Payne S.R. Church T.R. Wandell M. et al.Endoscopic detection of proximal serrated lesions and pathologic identification of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps vary on the basis of center.Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2014; 12: 1119-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar The optimal system will allow an endoscopist to perform a colonoscopy, create a colonoscopy report in an electronic format (endoscopy software or dictation), associate that report to a subsequent pathology report, extract meaningful quality measures (eg, ADR, ADR per procedure, advanced ADR, proximal ADR), adjust these rates for important covariates, and report these to the provider, a quality monitoring system (eg, the GI Quality Improvement Consortium), and the payer, all without any human review. A seamless process using NLP would both allow full transparency of care and encourage practice improvement. We are not too far from such a system, but before we can count a quality measure, we should know and accept the optimal measure(s) to count. All authors disclosed no financial relationships relevant to this publication. Natural language processing as an alternative to manual reporting of colonoscopy quality metricsGastrointestinal EndoscopyVol. 82Issue 3PreviewThe adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality metric tied to interval colon cancer occurrence. However, manual extraction of data to calculate and track the ADR in clinical practice is labor-intensive. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) method to identify adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) in patients undergoing their first screening colonoscopy. We compared the NLP-generated results with that of manual data extraction to test the accuracy of NLP and report on colonoscopy quality metrics using NLP. Full-Text PDF

AB  - Patients hospitalized with acute medical illness have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). American College of Chest Physicians guidelines list various chronic illnesses, sepsis, advanced age, history of VTE, and immobility as risk factors and recommend prophylactic anticoagulation using fondaparinux, low-molecular weight heparin, or low-dose unfractionated heparin. The objectives of this study were to examine pharmacological prophylaxis against VTE among hospitalized medically ill patients and to assess demographic and clinical correlates related to VTE prophylaxis. A retrospective (1999-2010) electronic medical records study included patients aged 40 years and older hospitalized for at least 3 days, with significant medical illness or with a VTE hospitalization 30-365 days before admission. Each patient's first qualifying hospitalization was analyzed. Exclusions were if VTE treatment was started within 1 day of admission, or if warfarin (and not heparin or enoxaparin) was used. Prophylaxis was defined if the first inpatient dose of subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin was at prophylaxis levels (lower than treatment levels). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with VTE prophylaxis. Among 12,980 patients, 22.1% received prophylaxis (11.8% with enoxaparin, 10.3% with heparin). VTE prophylaxis was positively associated with year of hospitalization, subcutaneous heparin in the month before admission, aspirin, self-pay status, age, and sepsis. VTE prophylaxis was negatively associated with smoking, alcohol, warfarin in the past 30 days, and primary diagnoses of stroke, infectious disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. Pharmacological VTE prophylaxis has increased significantly over the past 12 years but is still largely underused in patients hospitalized with acute medical illness. Multiple demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors are associated with inpatient VTE prophylaxis.

AB  - The objectives of this report are to determine the association between performance-based measures of physical function with caregiver reports of physical function in older adults with Alzheimer disease (AD) and to examine whether those associations vary by the level of patients’ cognitive functioning. Subjects included 180 patient-caregiver dyads who are enrolled in a clinical trial testing the impact of an occupational therapy intervention plus guideline-level care to delay functional decline among older adults with AD. The primary caregiver-reported measure is the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL). Performance-based measures include the Short Physical Performance Battery and the Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to determine the associations of each physical performance measure with ADCS-ADL, adjusting for cognition function and other covariates. We found significant correlations between caregiver reports and observed performance-based measures across all levels of cognitive function, with patients in the lowest cognitive group showing the highest correlation. These findings support the use of proxy reports to assess physical function among older adults with AD.

AB  - Assessment is a core function of public health. Comprehensive clinical data may enhance community health assessment by providing up-to-date, representative data for use in public health programs and policies, especially when combined with community-level data relevant to social determinants. In this study we examine routinely collected and geospatially-enhanced EHR data to assess population health at various levels of geographic granularity available from a regional health information exchange. We present preliminary findings and discuss important biases in EHR data. Future work is needed to develop methods for correcting for those biases to support routine epidemiology work of public health.

AB  - An increasing number of technologies allow providers to access the results of imaging studies. This study examined differences in access of radiology images compared with text-only reports through a health information exchange system by health care professionals.The study sample included 157,256 historical sessions from a health information exchange system that enabled 1,670 physicians and non-physicians to access text-based reports and imaging over the period 2013 to 2014. The primary outcome was an indicator of access of an imaging study instead of access of a text-only report. Multilevel mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the association between provider and session characteristics and access of images compared with text-only reports.Compared with primary care physicians, specialists had an 18% higher probability of accessing actual images instead of text-only reports (β = 0.18; P < .001). Compared with primary care practice settings, the probability of accessing images was 4% higher for specialty care practices (P < .05) and 8% lower for emergency departments (P < .05). Radiologists, orthopedists, and neurologists accounted for 79% of all the sessions with actual images accessed. Orthopedists, radiologists, surgeons, and pulmonary disease specialists accessed imaging more often than text-based reports only.Consideration for differences in the need to access images compared with text-only reports based on the type of provider and setting of care are needed to maximize the benefits of image sharing for patient care.

AB  - Goal setting is a common element of self-management support programs; however, little is known about the nature of patients' goals or how goals change during pain self-management. The purpose of the current study is to explore how patients' goals and views of goal setting change over the course of a peer-led pain self-management program.Veterans (n=16) completing a 4-month peer-led pain self-management program completed semi-structured interviews at baseline and follow-up regarding their goals for their pain. Interviews were analyzed using immersion/crystallization.Analyses revealed six themes: motivation to do something for their pain, more goal-oriented, actually setting goals, clarity of goal importance, more specific/measurable goal criteria, and more specific/measurable strategies.The current analyses illustrate how participants' goals can evolve over the course of a peer-led pain self-management program. Specifically, increased motivation, more openness to using goals, greater clarity of goal importance, more specific and measurable goals and strategies, and the influence of the peer coach relationship were described by participants.Pain self-management interventions should emphasize goal setting, and development of specific, measurable goals and plans. Trainings for providers should address the potential for the provider-patient relationship, particularly peer providers, to facilitate motivation and goal setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: Pediatric anxiety is prevalent but frequently underdiagnosed compared with other behavioral conditions in primary care practice. Pediatricians routinely screen for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder using the Vanderbilt Rating Scale, which includes a short screen for anxiety. We sought to examine the prevalence of potential anxiety among patients whose parents originally had concerns of disruptive behavior in a diverse setting and examine differences in anxiety across ethnic groups using the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADRS). Method: This was a cross-sectional analysis of medical records data of children between the ages of 5 to 12 years whose parents had concerns of disruptive behavior and received primary care from May 25, 2010, to January 31, 2014 at 2 pediatric community health clinics in Indianapolis. Results: Sixteen percent of children whose parents had concerns for disruptive behavior screened positive for anxiety based on the VADRS screen. Hispanic parents were less likely to report symptoms of anxiety (Spanish speaking: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2–0.8; English speaking: AOR 0.3, 95% CI, 0.1–0.9) compared with white and black families. Conclusion: Anxiety is detected at a lower rate among Hispanic pediatric patients using the VADRS. This may suggest differences in the performance of the VADRS among Spanish-speaking families.

AB  - Federal investment spurred health information exchange organization (HIO) development and maturation to provide third-party approaches to electronic health information exchange across disparate electronic health record (EHR) systems. By creating opportunities for data aggregation across multiple medical institutions, HIOs also spur research. Using data from a 2015 national web-based survey of HIOs (N = 64), we identified HIOs supporting or not supporting research, and compared characteristics of the 2 groups. We found that 15 (23%) of the 64 HIOs reported supporting research, 30 (47%) reported planning to support research, and 19 (30%) did not support research. Research-supporting HIOs were more likely than nonresearch supporting HIOs to offer advanced functionality, such as allowing users to query and retrieve data from multiple sources. Our study offers encouraging preliminary evidence that HIOs are supporting research, which could offer a solution to current challenges in creating comprehensive longitudinal clinical data sources for research.

AB  - Pseudogenes are fossil relatives of genes. Pseudogenes have long been thought of as "junk DNAs", since they do not code proteins in normal tissues. Although most of the human pseudogenes do not have noticeable functions, ∼20% of them exhibit transcriptional activity. There has been evidence showing that some pseudogenes adopted functions as lncRNAs and work as regulators of gene expression. Furthermore, pseudogenes can even be "reactivated" in some conditions, such as cancer initiation. Some pseudogenes are transcribed in specific cancer types, and some are even translated into proteins as observed in several cancer cell lines. All the above have shown that pseudogenes could have functional roles or potentials in the genome. Evaluating the relationships between pseudogenes and their gene counterparts could help us reveal the evolutionary path of pseudogenes and associate pseudogenes with functional potentials. It also provides an insight into the regulatory networks involving pseudogenes with transcriptional and even translational activities.In this study, we develop a novel approach integrating graph analysis, sequence alignment and functional analysis to evaluate pseudogene-gene relationships, and apply it to human gene homologs and pseudogenes. We generated a comprehensive set of 445 pseudogene-gene (PGG) families from the original 3,281 gene families (13.56%). Of these 438 (98.4% PGG, 13.3% total) were non-trivial (containing more than one pseudogene). Each PGG family contains multiple genes and pseudogenes with high sequence similarity. For each family, we generate a sequence alignment network and phylogenetic trees recapitulating the evolutionary paths. We find evidence supporting the evolution history of olfactory family (both genes and pseudogenes) in human, which also supports the validity of our analysis method. Next, we evaluate these networks in respect to the gene ontology from which we identify functions enriched in these pseudogene-gene families and infer functional impact of pseudogenes involved in the networks. This demonstrates the application of our PGG network database in the study of pseudogene function in disease context.

AB  - We tested a novel, web-based teaching electronic medical record to teach and assess residents' ability to enter appropriate admission orders for patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The primary objective was to determine if this tool could improve the learners' ability to enter an evidence-based, comprehensive initial care plan for critically ill patients.The authors created three modules using de-identifed real patient data from selected patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit. All senior residents (113 total) were invited to participate in a dedicated two-hour educational session to complete the modules. Learner performance was graded against gold standard admission order sets created by study investigators based on the latest evidence-based medicine and guidelines.The session was attended by 39 residents (34.5% of invitees). There was an average improvement of at least 20% in users' scores across the three modules (Module 3-Module 1 mean difference 22.5%; p = 0.001 and Module 3-Module 2 mean difference 20.3%; p = 0.001). Diagnostic acumen improved in successive modules. Almost 90% of the residents reported the technology was an effective form of teaching and would use it autonomously if more modules were provided.In this pilot project, using a novel educational tool, users' patient care performance scores improved with a high level of user satisfaction. These results identify a realistic and well-received way to supplement residents' training and assessment on core clinical care and patient management in the face of duty hour restrictions.

AB  - Group visits (GVs) are a promising intervention, but more work is needed to establish intervention effects. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of GVs and compare them with individual visits (INDs) for chronic care of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Caregivers and children (6-12 yrs) with ADHD participated in a comparative effectiveness trial from April 2014 to June 2015. Families were offered ADHD follow-up every 3 months as GVs versus INDs. Outcomes included ADHD core symptoms, child functioning at home, quality of life, perceived social support, and ADHD-related parenting challenges. Change scores from baseline to the study end were examined for parent and child outcomes within and between treatment conditions.Ninety-one children from 84 families participated. Eighteen families withdrew or were lost to follow-up. GV families attended more visits over 12 months, had significant improvement in mean parental emotional health (p = 0.04), and had a greater decrease in challenges related to misbehavior compared with IND families (p < 0.03). GV families experienced significant improvements in child functioning at home (p = 0.01) and reported more time for themselves, other siblings, and routine household activities (p < 0.01). Children receiving care as INDs reported a significant drop in mean emotional health. There were no significant changes in other outcomes.Families participating in GVs experienced multiple improvements related to family functioning and attended more follow-up visits. Findings confirm the effectiveness of the GV intervention in delivering critical parenting support as part of ADHD management.

AB  - Handoff education is both formal and informal and varies widely across medical school and residency training programs. Despite many efforts to improve clinical handoffs, little evidence has shown meaningful improvement. The objective of this study was to identify residents’ perspectives and develop a deeper understanding on the necessary training to conduct safe and effective patient handoffs. A qualitative study focused on the analysis of cognitive task interviews targeting end-of-shift handoff experiences with 35 residents from three geographically dispersed VA facilities. The interview data were analyzed using an iterative, consensus-based team approach. Researchers discussed and agreed on code definitions and corresponding case examples. Grounded theory was used to analyze the transcripts. Although some residents report receiving formal training in conducting handoffs (e.g., medical school coursework, resident boot camp/workshops, and handoff debriefing), many residents reported that they were only partially prepared for enacting them as interns. Experiential, practice-based learning (i.e., giving handoffs, covering night shift to match common issues to handoff content) was identified as the most suited and beneficial for delivering effective handoff training. Six skills were described as critical to learning effective handoffs: identifying pertinent information, providing anticipatory guidance, applying acquired clinical knowledge, being concise, incorporating delivery strategies, and appreciating the styles/preferences of handoff recipients. Residents identified the immersive performance and the experience of covering night shifts as the most important aspects of learning to execute effective handoffs. Formal education alone can miss the critical role of real-time sense-making throughout the process of handing off from one trainee to another. Interventions targeting senior resident mentoring and night shift could positively influence the cognitive and performance capacity for safe, effective handoffs.

AB  - The emergency department (ED) plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute heart failure (AHF). Despite the advent of novel biomarkers and traditional methods of assessment, such as history, examination, and chest X-ray, diagnosis of the dyspnoeic ED patient is, at times, very challenging. Focused cardiac and pulmonary ultrasound has emerged as a valid, facile and efficient method to aid in the initial diagnosis and management of AHF.

AB  - Introduction Pain, depression, and anxiety are prominent symptoms that frequently co-occur, causing significant debilitation and frequent primary care visits. This paper examines the acceptability of telecare and self-management modules in managing these conditions in a randomized trial. Methods The Comprehensive Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) trial compared an automated symptom management (ASM) plus self-management intervention with a comprehensive symptom management (CSM) intervention that added telecare facilitation of enhanced services. Data from the CAMMPS trial were analysed to compare the acceptability of these two interventions as indicated by utilization and patient satisfaction surveys. Results The mean number of automated reports completed was similar between the CSM and ASM groups (14.5 vs 14.0). Responses designated with clinically relevant “red alerts” (i.e. patient reports warranting an expedited nurse contact) were more frequent in the CSM group (10.2 vs 8.3). The CSM and ASM groups completed a similar number of the nine self-management modules (6.3 vs 5.8). The mean helpfulness score across all modules was higher in the CSM group than in the ASM group (1.8 vs 1.5; p = .003). The most common feedback suggestion from the ASM group was to have more personal interaction, while participants from both groups commonly suggested technical improvements or requests for more flexible timing of calls. Discussion Participants generally found both interventions satisfactory, with a trend in satisfaction data suggesting that patients tended to find the CSM intervention more helpful.

AB  - Multiple national organizations and leaders have called for increased attention to dementia prevention in those most vulnerable, for example persons with limited formal education. Prevention recommendations have included calls for multicomponent interventions that have the potential to improve both underlying neurobiological health and the ability to function despite neurobiological pathology, or what has been termed cognitive reserve. Test feasibility, treatment modifier, mechanism, and cognitive function effects of a multicomponent intervention consisting of foods high in polyphenols (i.e., MIND foods) to target neurobiological health, and speed of processing training to enhance cognitive reserve. We refer to this multicomponent intervention as MINDSpeed. MINDSpeed is being evaluated in a 2 × 2 randomized factorial design with 180 participants residing independently in a large Midwestern city. Qualifying participants are 60 years of age or older with no evidence of dementia, and who have completed 12 years or less of education. All participants receive a study-issued iPad to access the custom study application that enables participants, depending on randomization, to select either control or MIND food, and to play online cognitive games, either speed of processing or control games. All participants complete informed consent and baseline assessment, including urine and blood samples. Additionally, up to 90 participants will complete neuroimaging. Assessments are repeated immediately following 12 weeks of active intervention, and at 24 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome is an executive cognitive composite score. Secondary outcomes include oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and neuroimaging-captured structural and functional metrics of the hippocampus and cortical brain regions. MINDSpeed is the first study to evaluate the multicomponent intervention of high polyphenol intake and speed of processing training. It is also one of the first dementia prevention trials to target older adults with low education. The results of the study will guide future dementia prevention efforts and trials in high risk populations.

AB  - Abstract Objective Many policymakers and advocates assume that directed and query-based health information exchange (HIE) work together to meet organizations’ interoperability needs, but this is not grounded in a substantial evidence base. This study sought to clarify the relationship between the usage of these 2 approaches to HIE. Materials and Methods System user log files from a regional HIE organization and electronic health record system were combined to model the usage of HIE associated with a patient visit at 3 federally qualified health centers in New York. Regression models tested the hypothesis that directed HIE usage was associated with query-based usage and adjusted for factors reflective of the FITT (Fit between Individuals, Task &amp; Technology) framework. Follow-up interviews with 8 key informants helped interpret findings. Results Usage of query-based HIE occurred in 3.1% of encounters and directed HIE in 23.5%. Query-based usage was 0.6 percentage points higher when directed HIE provided imaging information, and 4.8 percentage points higher when directed HIE provided clinical documents. The probability of query-based HIE was lower for specialist visits, higher for postdischarge visits, and higher for encounters with nurse practitioners. Informants used query-based HIE after directed HIE to obtain additional information, support transitions of care, or in cases of abnormal results. Discussion The complementary nature of directed and query-based HIE indicates that both HIE functionalities should be incorporated into EHR Certification Criteria. Conclusions Quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that directed and query-based HIE exist in a complementary manner in ambulatory care settings.

AB  - Aging baby-boomers present significant challenges to accessible, affordable emergency care in America for patients of all ages. St. Louis physicians served as early innovators in the field of geriatric emergency medicine. This manuscript summarizes a multi-institutional November 2016 symposium reviewing the Missouri history of geriatric emergency care. In addition, this manuscript describes multispecialty organizations' guidelines, healthcare outcomes research, contemporary medical education paradigms, and evolving efforts to disseminate guideline-based geriatric emergency care using a "Boot Camp" approach and implementation science. This manuscript also reviews local adaptations to emergency medical services and palliative care, as well as the perspectives of emergency department leaders exploring the balance between infrastructure and personnel required to promote guideline-based geriatric emergency care with the anticipated benefits. This discussion is framed within the context of the American College of Emergency Physician's planned geriatric emergency department accreditation process scheduled to begin in 2018.

AB  - Objective Hypoglycemia (HG) occurs in up to 60% of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) each year. We assessed a HG alert tool in an electronic health record system, and determined its effect on clinical practice and outcomes.Methods The tool applied a statistical model, yielding patient-specific information about HG risk. We randomized outpatient primary-care providers (PCPs) to see or not see the alerts. Patients were assigned to study group according to the first PCP seen during four months. We assessed prescriptions, testing, and HG. Variables were compared by multinomial, logistic, or linear model. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04177147 (registered on 22 November 2019).Results Patients (N = 3350) visited 123 intervention PCPs; 3395 patients visited 220 control PCPs. Intervention PCPs were shown 18,645 alerts (mean of 152 per PCP). Patients’ mean age was 55 years, with 61% female, 49% black, and 49% Medicaid recipients. Mean baseline A1c and body mass index were similar between groups. During follow-up, the number of A1c and glucose tests, and number of new, refilled, changed, or discontinued insulin prescriptions, were highest for patients with highest risk. Per 100 patients on average, the intervention group had fewer sulfonylurea refills (6 vs. 8; p < .05) and outpatient encounters (470 vs. 502; p < .05), though the change in encounters was not significant. Frequency of HG events was unchanged.Conclusions Informing PCPs about risk of HG led to fewer sulfonylurea refills and visits. Longer-term studies are needed to assess potential for long-term benefits.

AB  - Although peer coaching can help patients manage chronic conditions, few studies have evaluated the effects of peer coaching on coaches, and no studies have systematically examined these effects in the context of chronic pain coaching. Peer coach outcomes were assessed as part of a randomized trial of peer coaching for chronic pain. In this exploratory analysis, linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in peer coaches’ pain and related outcomes from baseline to 6 and 9 months. The Šidák method was used to account for multiple comparisons. Peer coaches (N = 55) experienced statistically significant increases in anxiety and pain catastrophizing from baseline to 6 months, which were no longer significant after adjustment. All other changes were not statistically significant. Despite prior studies suggesting that peer coaches benefit from serving as a coach, the current study failed to support that conclusion. Peer coaching remains a promising model, with high potential for implementation, for a number of chronic conditions requiring self-management. However, to maximize the benefits of such interventions, it is essential to monitor both those being coached and the coaches themselves, and not to assume that serving as a coach is inherently beneficial.

AB  - The prevalence of depression in patients with cancer ranges from 8% to 24% within the first year of receiving a cancer diagnosis. Identifying predictors of depression outcomes may facilitate tailored or more intensive treatment in patient subgroups with a poorer prognosis for depression improvement. The objective of this study was to determine predictors of depression severity and improvement over 12 months among adults with cancer. Longitudinal analysis of data from the Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression trial was performed in 309 patients (n = 309) with cancer-related depression. Depression outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and included depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20) and global improvement (Depression Global Rating of Improvement (DGRI)). Multivariable repeated measures analyses, adjusting for treatment group, baseline depression, and time point, were conducted to determine symptom (pain), demographic, and clinical predictors of depression outcomes over 12 months. Pain was particularly important, with a clinically meaningful reduction in pain predicting a 12–24% greater odds of depression global improvement. Other factors that independently predicted better depression outcomes over 12 months included female sex, newly-diagnosed or maintainence/disease-free cancer, fewer comorbid medical conditions, and higher socioeconomic status. As expected, the three covariates adjusted for in the model (treatment group, passage of time, and baseline depression severity) also predicted depression outcomes. Pain as well as several demographic and clinical factors predict depression outcomes over 12 months. These findings may help identify patient subgroups requiring closer monitoring and more intensive or tailored depression treatment. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00313573

Understanding the relationship between climate change and the health of populations adds further complexity to global health issues.&#x0D; Objectives: To describe four examples of curricula that exist in U.S. based graduate-level public and population health informatics training programs.&#x0D; Methods: Biomedical informatics educators are challenged to provide learners with relevant, interesting, and meaningful educational experiences in working with and learning from the many data sources that comprise the domain of PHI. Programs at four institutions were reviewed to examine common teaching practices that stimulate learners to explore the field of public health informatics.&#x0D; Results: Four case studies represent a range of pedagogical approaches to meeting the requirements of three established accreditation/certification agencies relevant to PHI education. Despite their differences, each program achieved the established learning objectives along with a substantive record of student learning achievements.&#x0D; Conclusion: The overarching goal of empowering learners to serve an active and dynamic role in enhancing preventive measures, informing policy, improving personal health behaviors, and clarifying issues such as quality, cost of care, and the social determinants of health, are essential components of PHI education and training, and must receive additional consideration now and in the future by educators, policy makers, administrators, and government officials.

AB  - Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is common in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor outcomes. CDI risk factors in this population have been well characterized; however, risk factors of recurrent CDI (R-CDI) after treatment have not been explored. We sought to estimate the incidence of R-CDI and its associated risk factors in patients with cirrhosis.We performed a cohort study of patients with cirrhosis hospitalized with CDI between 2012 and 2016. We collected patient characteristics, including detailed information on the CDI, features of the underlying liver disease, and outcomes including R-CDI, hospital readmission, and mortality. R-CDI was defined as CDI occurring 2-8 weeks after the initial episode. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify variables independently associated with the outcomes.A total of 257 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and CDI were included. CDI was community associated in 22.6%. The incidence of R-CDI was 11.9%. R-CDI was not significantly associated with medications at hospital admission or discharge. Independent risk factors of R-CDI included increased Charlson Comorbidity Index (hazard ratio [HR] 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.55) and use of lactulose (HR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.09-6.09). The 30-day readmission rate was 37%, and readmission was associated with increased Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR 1.12; 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). The 90-day mortality was 22.8%.In patients with cirrhosis, R-CDI is associated with comorbidity burden and lactulose use. Attention to these factors might aid clinicians in efforts to prevent R-CDI and improve outcomes in this population.

AB  - Abstract Background A key challenge for improving the quality of health care is to be able to use a common framework to work with patient information acquired in any of the health and life science disciplines. Patient information collected during dental care exposes many of the challenges that confront a wider scale approach. For example, to improve the quality of dental care, we must be able to collect and analyze data about dental procedures from multiple practices. However, a number of challenges make doing so difficult. First, dental electronic health record (EHR) information is often stored in complex relational databases that are poorly documented. Second, there is not a commonly accepted and implemented database schema for dental EHR systems. Third, integrative work that attempts to bridge dentistry and other settings in healthcare is made difficult by the disconnect between representations of medical information within dental and other disciplines’ EHR systems. As dentistry increasingly concerns itself with the general health of a patient, for example in increased efforts to monitor heart health and systemic disease, the impact of this disconnect becomes more and more severe. To demonstrate how to address these problems, we have developed the open-source Oral Health and Disease Ontology (OHD) and our instance-based representation as a framework for dental and medical health care information. We envision a time when medical record systems use a common data back end that would make interoperating trivial and obviate the need for a dedicated messaging framework to move data between systems. The OHD is not yet complete. It includes enough to be useful and to demonstrate how it is constructed. We demonstrate its utility in an analysis of longevity of dental restorations. Our first narrow use case provides a prototype, and is intended demonstrate a prospective design for a principled data backend that can be used consistently and encompass both dental and medical information in a single framework. Results The OHD contains over 1900 classes and 59 relationships. Most of the classes and relationships were imported from existing OBO Foundry ontologies. Using the LSW2 ( LISP Semantic Web ) software library, we translated data from a dental practice’s EHR system into a corresponding Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation based on the OHD framework. The OWL representation was then loaded into a triple store, and as a proof of concept, we addressed a question of clinical relevance – a survival analysis of the longevity of resin filling restorations. We provide queries using SPARQL and statistical analysis code in R to demonstrate how to perform clinical research using a framework such as the OHD, and we compare our results with previous studies. Conclusions This proof-of-concept project translated data from a single practice. By using dental practice data, we demonstrate that the OHD and the instance-based approach are sufficient to represent data generated in real-world, routine clinical settings. While the OHD is applicable to integration of data from multiple practices with different dental EHR systems, we intend our work to be understood as a prospective design for EHR data storage that would simplify medical informatics. The system has well-understood semantics because of our use of BFO-based realist ontology and its representation in OWL. The data model is a well-defined web standard.

AB  - To identify recurrent themes, insights, and process recommendations from stakeholders in US organizations during the health information technology (HIT) modernization of an existing electronic health record (EHR) to a commercial-off-the-shelf product in both resource-plentiful settings and in a resource-constrained environment, the US Indian Health Service.Thirteen qualitative interviews with stakeholders in various organizations were conducted about HIT modernization efforts. Using a Theory of Change framework, recurring themes were identified and analyzed.The interviewees emphasized the importance of organizational and process revision during modernization, converting historical data, and clinical and leadership involvement. HIT implementation required technological and infrastructure redesign, additional training, and workflow reconfiguration. Motivations for modernization included EHR usability dissatisfaction, revenue enhancements, and improved clinical operations. Decision-making strategies, primarily during HIT selection, included meetings with stakeholders. Successful modernization resulted in improvements in clinical operations, patient experience, and financial outlay.Existing implementation frameworks fail to provide experiential feedback, such as implementation challenges, like data conversion, regulatory, functionality, and interoperability requirements. Regardless of the healthcare environment, HIT modernization requires the engagement of leadership and end-users during HIT selection and through all stages of the implementation to prepare people, processes, and technology. Organizations must iteratively define the technological, infrastructure, organizational, and workflow changes required for a successful HIT modernization effort.HIT modernization is an opportunity for organizational and technological change. Successful modernization requires a comprehensive, intentional, well-communicated, and multidisciplinary approach. Resource-constrained environments have the additional challenges of financial burdens, limited staffing, and unstable infrastructure.

AB  - A growing body of scientific evidence points to the potentially harmful cognitive effects of anticholinergic medications among older adults. Most interventions designed to promote deprescribing of anticholinergics have directly targeted healthcare professionals and have had mixed results. Consumer-facing technologies may provide a unique benefit by empowering patients and can complement existing healthcare professional-centric efforts.We initiated a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient-facing mobile application (Brain Safe app) compared to an attention control medication list app in reducing anticholinergic exposure among community-dwelling older adults. Study participants are adults aged 60 years and above, currently using at least one prescribed strong anticholinergic, and receiving primary care. The trial plans to enroll a total of 700 participants, randomly allocated in 1:1 proportion to the two study arms. Participants will have the Brain Safe app (intervention arm) or attention control medication list app (control arm) loaded onto a smartphone (study provided or personal device). All participants will be followed for 12 months and will have data collected at baseline, at 6 months, and 12 months by blinded outcome assessors. The primary outcome of the study is anticholinergic exposure measured as total standard daily dose (TSDD) computed from medication prescription electronic records. Secondary outcomes of the study are cognitive function and health-related quality of life.A consumer-facing intervention to promote deprescribing of potentially high-risk medications can be part of a multi-pronged approach to reduce inappropriate medication use among older adult patients. Delivering a deprescribing intervention via a mobile app is a novel approach and may hold great promise to accelerate deployment of medication safety initiatives across diverse patient populations.Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on October 10, 2019.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess whether using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) community activity level can accurately inform strategies for routine testing of facility staff for active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.DesignCross-sectional study.Setting and ParticipantsIn total, 59,930 nursing home staff tested for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indiana.MeasuresReceiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000.ResultsThe detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval 0.601‒0.696) and 0.649 (95% confidence interval 0.601‒0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants, yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive. Similarly, licensed practical nurses were 1.4% of staff, but 4.7% of positive cases.Conclusions and ImplicationsWe failed to observe a meaningful threshold of community COVID-19 activity for the purpose of predicting nursing homes with any positive staff. Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in August 2020 sets the minimum frequency of routine testing for nursing home staff based on county positivity rates. Using the recommended 5% county positivity rate to require weekly testing may miss asymptomatic infections among nursing home staff. Further data on results of all-staff testing efforts, particularly with the implementation of new widespread strategies such as point-of-care testing, is needed to guide policy to protect high-risk nursing home residents and staff. If the goal is to identify all asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infected nursing home staff, comprehensive repeat testing may be needed regardless of community level activity.

AB  - Patients who undergo the complex series of transitions from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) back to home represent a unique patient population with multiple comorbidities and impaired functional abilities. The needs and outcomes of patients who are discharged from the hospital to SNF before returning home are understudied in care transitions scholarship.To study the patient and caregiver challenges and perspectives on transitions from the hospital to the SNF and back to home.Between 48 h and 1 week after discharge from the SNF, semi-structured interviews were performed with a convenience sample of patients and caregivers in their homes. Within 1 to 2 weeks after the baseline interview, follow-up interviews were performed over the phone.A total of 39 interviewees comprised older adults undergoing the series of transitions from hospital to skilled nursing facility to home and their informal caregivers.A constructionist, grounded-theory approach was used to code the interviews, identify major themes and subthemes, and develop a theoretical model explaining the outcomes of the SNF to home transition.The mean age of the patients was 76.6 years and 64.8 years for the caregivers. Four major themes were identified: comforts of home, information needs, post-SNF care, and independence. Patients noted an extended time away from home and were motivated to return to and remain in the home. Information needs were variably met and affected post-SNF care, including medication management, appointments, and therapy gains and setbacks. Interviewees identified independent function at home as the most important outcome of the transition home.Post-SNF in home support is needed rapidly after discharge from the SNF to prevent adverse outcomes. In-home support needs to be highly individualized based on a patient's and caregiver's unique situation and needs.

AB  - Event notification systems are an approach to health information exchange (HIE) that notifies end-users of patient interactions with the healthcare system through real-time automated alerts. We examined associations between organizational capabilities and perceptions of event notification system use.We surveyed representatives (n = 196) from healthcare organizations (n = 96) that subscribed to 1 of 3 Health Information Organizations' event notification services in New York City (response rate = 27%). The survey was conducted in Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. Surveys measured respondent characteristics, perceived organizational capabilities, event notification use, care coordination, and care quality. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify relevant independent and dependent variables. We examined the relationship between organizational capabilities, care coordination, and care quality using multilevel linear regression models with random effects.Respondents indicated that the majority of their organizations provided follow-up care for emergency department visits (66%) and hospital admissions (73%). Perceptions of care coordination were an estimated 57.5% (β = 0.575; P < 0.001) higher among respondents who reported event notifications fit within their organization's existing workflows. Perceptions of care quality were 46.5% (β = 0.465; P < 0.001) higher among respondents who indicated event notifications fit within existing workflows and 23.8% (β = 0.238; P < 0.01) higher where respondents reported having supportive policies and procedures for timely response and coordination of event notifications.Healthcare organizations with specific workflow processes and positive perceptions of fit are more likely to use event notification services to improve care coordination and care quality. In addition, event notification capacity and patient consent procedures influence how end-users perceive event notification services.

AB  - Abstract Background Existing studies have demonstrated that the integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data can be used to better understand the onset and progression of many diseases, as well as identify new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, since the development of pathological phenotypes are influenced by a variety of complex biological processes, complete understanding of the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms for the cell and tissue morphology is still a challenge. In this study, we explored the relationship between the chromatin accessibility changes and the epithelial tissue proportion in histopathological images of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Methods An established whole slide image processing pipeline based on deep learning was used to perform global segmentation of epithelial and stromal tissues. We then used canonical correlation analysis to detect the epithelial tissue proportion-associated regulatory regions. By integrating ATAC-seq data with matched RNA-seq data, we found the potential target genes that associated with these regulatory regions. Then we used these genes to perform the following pathway and survival analysis. Results Using canonical correlation analysis, we detected 436 potential regulatory regions that exhibited significant correlation between quantitative chromatin accessibility changes and the epithelial tissue proportion in tumors from 54 patients (FDR &lt; 0.05). We then found that these 436 regulatory regions were associated with 74 potential target genes. After functional enrichment analysis, we observed that these potential target genes were enriched in cancer-associated pathways. We further demonstrated that using the gene expression signals and the epithelial tissue proportion extracted from this integration framework could stratify patient prognoses more accurately, outperforming predictions based on only omics or image features. Conclusion This integrative analysis is a useful strategy for identifying potential regulatory regions in the human genome that are associated with tumor tissue quantification. This study will enable efficient prioritization of genomic regulatory regions identified by ATAC-seq data for further studies to validate their causal regulatory function. Ultimately, identifying epithelial tissue proportion-associated regulatory regions will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and inform the development of potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Background Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) funded demonstration project to evaluate financial incentives for nursing facilities providing care for 6 clinical conditions to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations (PAHs). The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) site tested payment incentives alone and in combination with the successful nurse-led OPTIMISTIC clinical model. Our objective was to identify facility and resident characteristics associated with transfers, including financial incentives with or without the clinical model. Methods This was a longitudinal analysis from April 2017 to June 2018 of transfers among nursing home residents in 40 nursing facilities, 17 had the full clinical + payment model (1726 residents) and 23 had payment only model (2142 residents). Using CMS claims data, the Minimum Data Set, and Nursing Home Compare, multilevel logit models estimated the likelihood of all-cause transfers and PAHs (based on CMS claims data and ICD-codes) associated with facility and resident characteristics. Results The clinical + payment model was associated with 4.1 percentage points (pps) lower risk of all-cause transfers (95% confidence interval [CI] − 6.2 to − 2.1). Characteristics associated with lower PAH risk included residents aged 95+ years (− 2.4 pps; 95% CI − 3.8 to − 1.1), Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligibility (− 2.5 pps; 95% CI − 3.3 to − 1.7), advanced and moderate cognitive impairment (− 3.3 pps; 95% CI − 4.4 to − 2.1; − 1.2 pps; 95% CI − 2.2 to − 0.2). Changes in Health, End-stage disease and Symptoms and Signs (CHESS) score above most stable (CHESS score 4) increased the risk of PAH by 7.3 pps (95% CI 1.5 to 13.1). Conclusions Multiple resident and facility characteristics are associated with transfers. Facilities with the clinical + payment model demonstrated lower risk of all-cause transfers compared to those with payment only, but not for PAHs.

AB  - Objective Studies describe COVID-19 patient characteristics and outcomes across populations, but reports of variation across healthcare facilities are lacking. The objectives were to examine differences in COVID-19 patient volume and mortality across facilities, and understand whether facility variation in mortality was due primarily to differences in patient versus facility characteristics. Design Observational cohort study with multilevel mixed effects logistic regression modelling. Setting The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest healthcare system in the USA. Participants Patients with COVID-19. Main outcome All-cause mortality within 45 days after COVID-19 testing (March–May, follow-up through 16 July 2020). Results Among 13 510 patients with COVID-19, 3942 (29.2%) were admitted (2266/3942 (57.5%) ward; 1676/3942 (42.5%) intensive care unit (ICU)) and 679/3942 (17.2%) received mechanical ventilation. Marked heterogeneity was observed across facilities in median age (range: 34.3–83.9 years; facility mean: 64.7, SD 7.2 years); patient volume (range: 1–737 at 160 facilities; facility median: 48.5, IQR 14–105.5); hospital admissions (range: 1–286 at 133 facilities; facility median: 11, IQR 1–26.5); ICU caseload (range: 1–85 at 115 facilities; facility median: 4, IQR 0–12); and mechanical ventilation (range: 1–53 at 90 facilities; facility median: 1, IQR 0–5). Heterogeneity was also observed in facility mortality for all patients with COVID-19 (range: 0%–29.7%; facility median: 8.9%, IQR 2.4%–13.7%); inpatients (range: 0%–100%; facility median: 18.0%, IQR 5.6%–28.6%); ICU patients (range: 0%–100%; facility median: 28.6%, IQR 14.3%–50.0%); and mechanical ventilator patients (range: 0%–100%; facility median: 52.7%, IQR 33.3%–80.6%). The majority of variation in facility mortality was attributable to differences in patient characteristics (eg, age). Conclusions Marked heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and mortality were observed across VA facilities nationwide. Differences in patient characteristics accounted for the majority of explained variation in mortality across sites. Variation in unadjusted COVID-19 mortality across facilities or nations should be considered with caution.

AB  - The widely used Fellegi-Sunter model for probabilistic record linkage does not leverage information contained in field values and consequently leads to identical classification of match status regardless of whether records agree on rare or common values. Since agreement on rare values is less likely to occur by chance than agreement on common values, records agreeing on rare values are more likely to be matches. Existing frequency-based methods typically rely on knowledge of error probabilities associated with field values and frequencies of agreed field values among matches, often derived using prior studies or training data. When such information is unavailable, applications of these methods are challenging. In this paper, we propose a simple two-step procedure for frequency-based matching using the Fellegi-Sunter framework to overcome these challenges. Matching weights are adjusted based on frequency distributions of the agreed field values among matches and non-matches, estimated by the Fellegi-Sunter model without relying on prior studies or training data. Through a real-world application and simulation, our method is found to produce comparable or better performance than the unadjusted method. Furthermore, frequency-based matching provides greater improvement in matching accuracy when using poorly discriminating fields with diminished benefit as the discriminating power of matching fields increases.

AB  - The failure of past practices and policies related to opioid prescribing for chronic pain has led federal agencies and professional organizations to recommend multimodal approaches that prioritize evidence-based nonpharmacological pain treatments (NPTs). These multimodal approaches, which include both traditional and complementary/integrative approaches, hold great promise for reducing the burden of chronic pain and reducing opioid use. Unfortunately, NPT approaches are underutilized due to a daunting array of interrelated barriers including the public's attitudes and beliefs about chronic pain and its treatment. Given the dual crises of chronic pain and opioid use, there is a critical need for a national public health campaign on chronic pain and its treatment to help educate the American public about NPT pain management options, while countering the misleading messages promulgated by the pharmaceutical industry, including but not limited to messages promoting the broad use of prescription opioids and minimizing its risks. Despite these dual crises of chronic pain and opioid use in the U.S., there has never been a concerted effort to broadly educate the American public about these issues and NPT pain management options.

AB  - The Protocol-guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurologic Symptoms (PREVENT) program was a complex quality improvement (QI) intervention targeting transient ischemic attack (TIA) evidence-based care. The aim of this study was to evaluate program acceptability among the QI teams and factors associated with degrees of acceptability.QI teams from six Veterans Administration facilities participated in active implementation for a one-year period. We employed a mixed methods study to evaluate program acceptability. Multiple data sources were collected over implementation phases and triangulated for this evaluation. First, we conducted 30 onsite, semi-structured interviews during active implementation with 35 participants at 6 months; 27 interviews with 28 participants at 12 months; and 19 participants during program sustainment. Second, we conducted debriefing meetings after onsite visits and monthly virtual collaborative calls. All interviews and debriefings were audiotaped, transcribed, and de-identified. De-identified files were qualitatively coded and analyzed for common themes and acceptability patterns. We conducted mixed-methods matrix analyses comparing acceptability by satisfaction ratings and by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA).Overall, the QI teams reported the PREVENT program was acceptable. The clinical champions reported high acceptability of the PREVENT program. At pre-implementation phase, reviewing quality data, team brainstorming solutions and development of action plans were rated as most useful during the team kickoff meetings. Program acceptability perceptions varied over time across active implementation and after teams accomplished actions plans and moved into sustainment. We observed team acceptability growth over a year of active implementation in concert with the QI team's self-efficacy to improve quality of care. Guided by the TFA, the QI teams' acceptability was represented by the respective seven components of the multifaceted acceptability construct.Program acceptability varied by time, by champion role on QI team, by team self-efficacy, and by perceived effectiveness to improve quality of care aligned with the TFA. A complex quality improvement program that fostered flexibility in local adaptation and supported users with access to data, resources, and implementation strategies was deemed acceptable and appropriate by front-line clinicians implementing practice changes in a large, national healthcare organization.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02769338 .

AB  - Older veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) often use both VHA and non-VHA providers for their care. This dual use, especially around an inpatient visit, can lead to fragmented care during the time of transition post-discharge. Interventions that target patient activation may be valuable ways to help veterans manage complex medication regimens and care plans from multiple providers. The Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) is an evidence-based model that helps older adults gain confidence and skills to achieve their health goals post-discharge. Our study examined the impact of CTI upon patient activation for veterans discharged from non-VHA hospitals. In total, 158 interventions were conducted for 87 veterans. From baseline to follow-up there was a significant 1.7-point increase in patient activation scores, from 5.4 to 7.1. This association was only found among those who completed the intervention. The most common barriers to completion were difficulty reaching the veteran by phone, patient declining the intervention, and rehospitalization during the 30 days post-discharge. Care transitions guided by social workers may be a promising way to improve patient activation. However, future research and practice should address barriers to completion and examine the impact of increased patient activation on health outcomes.

AB  - Pain, anxiety, and depression (PAD) are common, co-occurring symptoms that adversely affect one another and may respond to common treatments. PAD composite measures would be useful for tracking treatment response in patients with PAD symptoms. The goal of this study is to compare 3 different PAD composite scales in terms of construct validity, responsiveness, and utility in predicting global improvement.The sample consisted of 294 primary care patients enrolled in a telecare trial for treating pain, anxiety, and depression. Assessments at baseline and 3 months included the Brief Pain Inventory, PHQ-9 depression scale, GAD-7 anxiety scale, PROMIS measures, Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form items, disability measures, and patient-reported global improvement. Construct validity of the PAD composite measures, their responsiveness, and their ability to predict global improvement was analyzed using Pearson correlations, standardized response means, and receiver operating characteristics analysis.PAD composite measures correlated strongly with one another, and moderately with measures of function, vitality, and disability. Each PAD composite measure demonstrated similar responsiveness in detecting improvement at 3 months as assessed by standardized response means (SRMs) and area under the curve (AUC analyses).The SRMs for partial and substantial global improvement corresponded to moderate (Cohen's d of 0.58 to 0.69) and large (0.81 to 0.93) effect sizes, respectively.Three different PAD composite measures demonstrate good construct validity as well as responsiveness in detecting global improvement of pain, anxiety and depression at 3 months.

AB  - Cancer screening uptake differs between groups in ways that cannot be explained by socioeconomic status alone. This study examined associations between material, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of financial hardship and cancer screening behaviors. Surveys were mailed to 7,979 people ages 18–75 who were seen in the statewide health system in Indiana. Participants reported SES, feelings about finances, and whether they had to forgo medical care due to cost. This was compared to uptake of mammogram, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, and Pap testing in best-fit multivariable logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic and healthcare characteristics. A total of 970 surveys were returned; the majority of respondents were female (54%), non-Hispanic White (75%), and over 50 years old (76%). 15% reported forgoing medical care due to cost; this barrier was higher among Black than White participants (24% vs. 13%; p = 0.001). In a best fit regression model for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, those who reported they had to forgo medical care due to cost had lower odds of screening (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.22–0.74). Forgoing medical care due to cost was not significantly associated with Pap testing in bivariate analyses. For mammogram, forgoing medical care due to cost was significant in bivariate analyses (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.22–0.88), but was not significant in the multivariable model. Associations between financial hardship and cancer screening suggest the need to reduce barriers to cancer screening even among patients who have access to healthcare. Future research should explore barriers related to both healthcare and personal costs.

AB  - Background:A brief query was fielded to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities across the United States to provide an initial assessment of recreation therapy (RT) and creative arts therapy (CAT) telehealth utilization.Methods:To develop an understanding of barriers and identify potential solutions for better delivery of services, a cross-sectional survey was deployed to points of contact at 136 VHA facilities. The survey included questions across five areas: staff, infrastructure, barriers to use, training, and interventions being deployed. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and a thematic analysis of qualitative responses was conducted.Results:The most frequent themes from aggregated responses indicated a need for hands-on training, reliable telehealth equipment, and accessible training and tools for Veteran patients who want to use telehealth services.Conclusion:Telehealth delivery of RT/CAT has increased services to Veteran patient populations; however, equipment and training are needed to expand consistent delivery to enhance patient reach across a national health care system.

AB  - To examine the effectiveness of event notification service (ENS) alerts on health care delivery processes and outcomes for older adults.We deployed ENS alerts in 2 Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers using regional health information exchange (HIE) networks from March 2016 to December 2019. Alerts targeted VA-based primary care teams when older patients (aged 65+ years) were hospitalized or attended emergency departments (ED) outside the VA system. We employed a concurrent cohort study to compare postdischarge outcomes between patients whose providers received ENS alerts and those that did not (usual care). Outcome measures included: timely follow-up postdischarge (actual phone call within 7 days or an in-person primary care visit within 30 days) and all-cause inpatient or ED readmission within 30 days. Generalized linear mixed models, accounting for clustering by primary care team, were used to compare outcomes between groups.Compared to usual care, veterans whose primary care team received notification of non-VA acute care encounters were 4 times more likely to have phone contact within 7 days (AOR = 4.10, P < .001) and 2 times more likely to have an in-person visit within 30 days (AOR = 1.98, P = .007). There were no significant differences between groups in hospital or ED utilization within 30 days of index discharge (P = .057).ENS was associated with increased timely follow-up following non-VA acute care events, but there was no associated change in 30-day readmission rates. Optimization of ENS processes may be required to scale use and impact across health systems.Given the importance of ENS to the VA and other health systems, this study provides guidance for future research on ENS for improving care coordination and population outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02689076.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the association between systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop, worsening renal function (WRF), and prognosis in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).A large drop in SBP early after hospital admission for AHF might be associated with increased risk for WRF and prognosis. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the interaction between WRF and a drop in SBP on clinical outcomes.A post hoc analysis among 6,544 patients with AHF enrolled in the RELAX-AHF-2 (Relaxin in Acute Heart Failure-2) trial was performed. Blood pressure was uniformly and repetitively measured. Peak SBP drop was defined as the difference between baseline SBP and lowest SBP documented during the first 48 hours. WRF was defined by an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline to day 5.Peak SBP drop was independently associated with a higher risk for WRF (HR: 1.11 per 10 mm Hg SBP drop; P < 0.001), 5-day worsening heart failure (HR: 1.12 per 10 mm Hg SBP drop; P = 0.006), and 180-day cardiovascular death (HR: 1.09 per 10 mm Hg SBP drop; P = 0.026) after adjustment for potential confounders including baseline SBP. There was no interaction between the prognostic value of early SBP drop according to the presence or absence of WRF.In patients hospitalized for AHF, a greater early drop in SBP was associated with a higher incidence of WRF, worsening heart failure, and an increased risk for 180-day cardiovascular death. However, the association between SBP drop and prognosis was not influenced by WRF. (Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Serelaxin When Added to Standard Therapy in AHF [RELAX-AHF-2]; NCT01870778).

AB  - COVID-19 highlights preexisting inequities that affect health outcomes and access to care for Black and Brown Americans. The Marion County Public Health Department in Indiana sought to address inequities in COVID-19 testing by using surveillance data to place community testing sites in areas with the highest incidence of disease. Testing site demographic data indicated that targeted testing reached populations with the highest disease burden, suggesting that local health departments can effectively use surveillance data as a tool to address inequities.

AB  - Based on many published reports, African American patients with cancer experience higher pain severity scores and lower pain relief than White patients. This disparity results from undertreatment of pain and is compounded by low adherence to prescribed non-opioid and opioid analgesics among African American patients with cancer. While nearly one in four patients use cannabis to manage cancer-related symptoms, less is known about how cannabis use influences pain relief in this patient population.This study is based on preliminary data from an ongoing study of longitudinal outcomes of opioid therapy among African American and White patients with cancer. Linear mixed-effects models were utilized to assess the interaction of race and cannabis use on pain relief using "least pain" item scores from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) averaged across three time points. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables.This analysis included 136 patients (49 African American, 87 White). Overall, 30.1% of the sample reported cannabis use for cancer pain. The mean "least pain" score on BPI was 3.3 (SD=2.42) on a scale of 0-10. African American patients had a mean "least pain" score 1.32±0.48 units higher (indicating lower pain relief) than White patients (p=0.006). Cannabis use did not have a significant main effect (p=0.28). However, cannabis use was a significant moderator of the relationship between race and "least pain" (p=0.03). In the absence of cannabis use, African Americans reported higher "least pain" scores compared to Whites (mean difference=1.631±0.5, p=0.001). However, this disparity was no longer observed in African American patients reporting cannabis use (mean "least pain" difference=0.587±0.59, p=0.32).These findings point to the possible role of cannabis in cancer pain management and its potential to reduce racial disparities. These findings are preliminary and further research into the role of cannabis in cancer pain outcomes is needed.

AB  - Guidelines recommend albumin as the plasma-expander of choice for acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis. However, the impact of these recommendations on patient outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to determine the practice-patterns and outcomes associated with albumin use in a large, nationwide-US cohort of hospitalized cirrhotics with AKI.A retrospective cohort study was performed in hospitalized cirrhotics with AKI using Cerner-Health-Facts database from January 2009 to March 2018. 6786 were included for analysis on albumin-practice-patterns, and 4126 had available outcomes data. Propensity-score-adjusted model was used to determine the association between albumin use, AKI-recovery and in-hospital survival.Median age was 61-years (60% male, 70% white), median serum-creatinine was 1.8 mg/dL and median Model for End-stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 24. Albumin was given to 35% of patients, of which 50% received albumin within 48-hours of AKI-onset, and 17% received appropriate weight-based dosing. Albumin was used more frequently in patients with advanced complications of cirrhosis, higher MELD-Na scores and patients admitted to urban-teaching hospitals. After propensity-matching and multivariable adjustment, albumin use was not associated with AKI-recovery (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% confidence-interval [CI]: 0.59-1.07, P = .130) or in-hospital survival (OR 0.76 [95% CI: 0.46-1.25], P = .280), compared with crystalloids. Findings were unchanged in subgroup analyses of patients with varying cirrhosis complications and disease severity.USA hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and AKI frequently do not receive intravenous albumin, and albumin use was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. Prospective randomised trials are direly needed to evaluate the impact of albumin in cirrhotics with AKI.

AB  - Transgender individuals are less likely to have had a primary care visit in the last year than cisgender individuals. While the importance of multidisciplinary clinics for transgender care has been established, little is known about the healthcare experiences of transgender patients with these clinics.To describe how patients experience transgender clinics and how these experiences compare to those experiences in other settings.Twenty-one adult patients of a gender health program.Semi-structured interviews of transgender patients. The interviews focused on two domains: healthcare experiences and relationships with healthcare providers.Overall, transgender patients expressed a need for healthcare services, particularly for primary care, that are partially met by the comprehensive care clinic model. Limitations in access included the lack of willing providers, where the patients live, and long wait times for appointments. Participants recounted a range of experiences, both positive and negative, with providers outside of the transgender clinic, but only positive experiences to share about providers from the transgender clinic.Outside specialty transgender settings, many patients had negative experiences with providers who were unwilling or unable to provide care. This study speaks to the need for primary care providers who can and will treat transgender patients, as well as the need for healthcare spaces that feel safe to transgender patents.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate veteran patient and provider perceptions and preferences on complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) for headache management. Background The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has spearheaded a Whole Health system of care focusing on CIM-based care for veteran patients. Less is known about patients’ and providers’ CIM perceptions and preferences for chronic headache management. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 veteran patients diagnosed with headache and 43 clinical providers, across 12 VHA Headache Centers of Excellence (HCoE), from January 2019 to March 2020. We conducted thematic and case comparative analyses. Results Veteran patients and VHA clinical providers viewed CIM favorably for the treatment of chronic headache. Specific barriers to CIM approaches included: (1) A lack of personnel specialized in specific CIM approaches for timely access, and (2) variation in patient perceptions and responses to CIM treatment efficacy for headache management. Conclusion Veteran patients and VHA clinical providers in this study viewed CIM favorably as a safe addition to mainstream headache treatments. Advantages to CIM include favorable adverse effect profiles and patient autonomy over the treatment. By adding more CIM providers and resources throughout the VHA, CIM modalities may be recommended more routinely in the management of veterans with headache.

AB  - Telestroke networks are associated with improved outcomes from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and facilitate greater access to care, particularly in underserved regions. These networks also have the potential to influence patient disposition through avoiding unnecessary interhospital transfers. This study examines the effect of implementation of the VA National Telestroke Program (NTSP) on interhospital transfer among Veterans.We analyzed patients with AIS presenting to the emergency departments of 21 VA hospitals before and after telestroke implementation. Transfer rates were determined through review of administrative data and chart review and patient and facility-level characteristics were collected to identify predictors of transfer. Comparisons were made using t test, Wilcoxon rank sum, and χ2 analysis. Multivariable logistic regression with sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of telestroke implementation on transfer rates.We analyzed 3,488 stroke encounters (1,056 pre-NTSP and 2,432 post-NTSP). Following implementation, we observed an absolute 14.4% decrease in transfers across all levels of stroke center designation. Younger age, higher stroke severity, and shorter duration from symptom onset were associated with transfer. At the facility level, hospitals with lower annual stroke volume were more likely to transfer; 1 hospital saw an increase in transfer rates following implementation. After adjusting for patient and facility characteristics, the implementation of VA NTSP resulted in a nearly 60% reduction in odds of transfer (odds ratio 0.39 [0.19, 0.77]).In addition to improving treatment in acute stroke, telestroke networks have the potential to positively affect the efficiency of interhospital networks through disposition optimization and the avoidance of unnecessary transfers.

AB  - Hospitals are increasingly replacing pagers with clinical texting systems that allow users to use smartphones to send messages while maintaining compliance for privacy and security. As more institutions adopt such systems, the need to understand the impact of such transitions on team communication becomes ever more significant.We conducted focus groups with hospitalists and individual interviews with nurses at one academic medical center in the Midwest. All interviews and focus groups were audiorecorded, transcribed, and deidentified for analysis. All transcripts and notes were independently read by two members of the research team and coded for themes.Twenty-one hospitalists and eight nurses participated in the study. Although study participants spoke favorably of texting, they identified more dissatisfactions with texting than benefits. There were disagreements regarding appropriate texting practices both within and between the hospitalists and nurses.Despite the benefits of texting, there is room for improving team communication and understanding in the realm of clinical texting. A lack of shared understanding regarding when and how to use texting may require long-term solutions that address teamwork and appropriateness.

AB  - Access to up-to-date patient medical history is essential for dental clinicians (DCs) to avoid potential harm to patients and to improve dental treatment outcomes. The predominant approach for dental clinicians (DCs) to gather patients' medical history is through patient-reported medical histories and medical consults. However, studies reported varied concordance and reliability of patient-reported medical conditions and medication histories compared to the patient medical records and this process also places a significant burden on patients. Information technology tools/platforms such as an integrated electronic health record containing an electronic dental record module may address these issues. However, these integrated systems are expensive and technically complex and may not be easily adopted by DCs in solo and small group practice who provide the most dental care. The recent expansion of regional healthcare information exchange (HIE) provides another approach, but to date, studies on connecting DCs with HIE are very limited. Our study objectives were to model different aspects of the current approaches to identify the strengths and weaknesses, and then model the HIE approach that addresses the weaknesses and retain the strengths of current approaches. The models of current approaches identified the people, resources, organizational aspects, workflow, and areas for improvement; while models of the HIE approach identified system requirements, functions, and processes that may be shared with software developers and other stakeholders for future development.There are three phases in this study. In Phase 1, we retrieved peer-reviewed PubMed indexed manuscripts published between January 2013 and November 2020 and extracted modeling related data from selected manuscripts. In Phase 2, we built models for the current approaches by using the Integrated DEFinition Method 0 function modeling method (IDEF0), the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Use Case Diagram, and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) methods. In Phase 3, we created three conceptual models for the HIE approach.From the 47 manuscripts identified, three themes emerged: 1) medical consult process following patient-reported medical history, 2) integrated electronic dental record-electronic health record (EDR-EHR), and 3) HIE. Three models were built for each of the three themes. The use case diagrams described the actions of the dental patients, DCs, medical providers and the use of information systems (EDR-EHR/HIE). The IDEF0 models presented the major functions involved. The BPMN models depicted the detailed steps of the process and showed how the patient's medical history information flowed through different steps. The strengths and weaknesses revealed by the models of the three approaches were also compared.We successfully modeled the DCs' current approaches of accessing patient medical history and designed an HIE approach that addressed the current approaches' weaknesses as well as leveraged their strengths. Organizational management and end-users can use this information to decide the optimum approach to integrate dental and medical care. The illustrated models are comprehensive and can also be adopted by EHR and EDR vendors to develop a connection between dental systems and HIEs.

AB  - Abstract Background Recruiting healthcare providers as research subjects often rely on in-person recruitment strategies. Little is known about recruiting provider participants via electronic recruitment methods. In this study, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe and evaluate a primarily electronic approach to recruiting primary care providers (PCPs) as subjects in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a decision support intervention. Methods We adapted an existing framework for healthcare provider research recruitment, employing an electronic consent form and a mix of brief synchronous video presentations, email, and phone calls to recruit PCPs into the RCT. To evaluate the success of each electronic strategy, we estimated the number of consented PCPs associated with each strategy, the number of days to recruit each PCP and recruitment costs. Results We recruited 45 of 63 eligible PCPs practicing at ten primary care clinic locations over 55 days. On average, it took 17 business days to recruit a PCP (range 0–48) and required three attempts (range 1–7). Email communication from the clinic leaders led to the most successful recruitments, followed by brief synchronous video presentations at regularly scheduled clinic meetings. We spent approximately $89 per recruited PCP. We faced challenges of low email responsiveness and limited opportunities to forge relationships. Conclusion PCPs can be efficiently recruited at low costs as research subjects using primarily electronic communications, even during a time of high workload and stress. Electronic peer leader outreach and synchronous video presentations may be particularly useful recruitment strategies. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT04295135 . Registered 04 March 2020.

AB  - Depression is highly prevalent and persistent among survivors of stroke. It is unknown how treatment for depression among survivors of stroke has changed in the evolving context of stroke care and mental health care in the general US population, especially among vulnerable sociodemographic subgroups who bear higher risks for stroke and unfavorable poststroke outcomes and experience disparities in access to and quality of stroke and mental health care. The study examined temporal trends in outpatient treatment for depression among survivors of stroke in the United States between 2004 and 2017.The study sample consisted of 10,243 adult survivors of stroke and 264,645 adults without stroke drawn from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey in the United States. Trends in outpatient treatment for depression and potential unmet needs in the stroke population, including variations across sociodemographic subgroups, were examined and compared with the nonstroke population.The rate of receipt of outpatient treatment for depression among survivors of stroke was 17.7% in 2004-2005 and 16.0% in 2016-2017 (adjusted odds ratio for period change [aOR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.71-1.15). Older, male, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic survivors of stroke were less likely to receive treatment for depression. Approximately two-thirds of survivors of stroke who screened positive for depression received no outpatient treatment during a calendar year. The sociodemographic disparities and treatment gap persisted during the study period, which differed from the nonstroke population. Among survivors of stroke who received any treatment for depression, there was a remarkable increase in use of psychotherapy (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.28-4.01), despite its less frequent use compared with pharmacotherapy.Although depression is common after stroke, the majority of survivors of stroke receive no treatment for depression. This gap has remained largely unchanged over past decades, with substantial sociodemographic differences. Efforts are needed to improve depression care for survivors of stroke and reduce disparities.

AB  - Experiences with incarceration are linked to poor mental and physical health across the life course. The purpose of this research is to examine whether incarceration histories are associated with worse physical and mental health among older adults. We apply an intersectionality framework and consider how the intersection of sexism and racism leads to unequal health outcomes following incarceration among women and people of color.We employ 2 measures of health (i.e., number of depressive symptoms and physical limitations) to broadly capture mental and physical health. Using data from Waves 11 and 12 of the Health and Retirement Study, we estimated a series of general linear models to analyze differences in health by incarceration history, gender/sex, and race/ethnicity.Findings suggest that experiences with incarceration are associated with a greater number of physical limitations and more depressive symptoms among older men and women, net of sociodemographic characteristics, early-life conditions, and lifetime stressful events. Formerly incarcerated women, particularly women of color, had more physical limitations and depressive symptoms relative to other groups.These findings suggest that incarceration histories have far-reaching health implications. Older women of color with incarceration histories experience markedly high levels of physical limitations and depressive symptoms in later life.

AB  - A rapid review was conducted to synthesize evidence of palliative care delivery changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes were synthesized according to the eight domains of high-quality palliative care and enduring implications for oncology nurses beyond the pandemic discussed.The most significant changes occurred in the structure and processes of palliative care (Domain 1), where increased utilization of telehealth was critical in circumventing barriers imposed by COVID-19 mitigation. The suboptimal availability of community-based psychosocial supports for patients and caregivers and inadequate health system-based psychosocial supports for healthcare providers were highlighted (Domains 3-5). The pandemic also ushered in an increased emphasis on the need for advance care planning (ACP), where integrating its delivery earlier in the outpatient setting and shifting policy to promote subsequent virtual documentation (Domain 8) were essential to ensure care preferences were clarified and accessible before health crises occurred.Continuing to embrace and sustain systems-level changes with respect to telehealth, psychosocial supports, and ACP are critical to bridging gaps in palliative care delivery underscored by the pandemic. Oncology nurses are well positioned to fill these gaps in care beyond the pandemic by providing evidence-based, palliative care throughout the cancer continuum.

In a double-blind randomized, controlled trial (CLICK [Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease]; URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02841280), we demonstrated that chlorthalidone substantially reduced blood pressure (BP) in stage 4 CKD.2 Here, we examine the drug’s safety and efficacy in people with resistant hypertension and stage 4 CKD with or without a loop diuretic and whether chlorthalidone reduces albuminuria.After receiving study approval by an institutional review committee and obtaining informed consent, we randomly assigned patients with stage 4 CKD to either placebo or chlorthalidone 12.5 mg daily in a 1:1 ratio stratified by previous loop diuretic use. The primary end point was the change in 24-hour systolic ambulatory BP from baseline to 12 weeks. Of the 160 randomized patients, 113 (71%) had resistant hypertension, defined as having poorly controlled 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring despite receiving ≥3 antihypertensive medications. Among the 90 participants (80%) on loop diuretics, 42 (78%) were in the placebo group and 48 (81%) were in the chlorthalidone group. Patients on average took 4.1 antihypertensive agents (SD 1.1). K-sparing diuretics were used in 14 (12%) patients (spironolactone 13, amiloride 1), of whom 9 (17%) were assigned placebo and 5 (8%) chlorthalidone. Mean 24-hour ambulatory BP at randomization was 140.7 (8.4)/71.8 (9.8) mm Hg in the placebo group and 142.7 (7.9)/73.3 (10.5) mm Hg in the chlorthalidone group. The statistical approach used in the current analysis mirrored that of the main analysis of the CLICK trial. All supporting data are available within the article and the original publication.2The adjusted change from baseline to 12 weeks in 24-hour systolic BP was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.3 to 5.0) in the placebo group (n=54) and −12.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −16.4 to −8.8) in the chlorthalidone group (n=59). The between-group difference was −13.9 mm Hg (95% CI, −19.4 to −8.4; P<0.0001; Table). Improvement in clinic BP occurred rapidly within 4 weeks and was sustained over the 12 weeks of the trial. Seated clinic systolic BP was reduced by 13.2, 14.5, and 16.2 mm Hg with chlorthalidone in 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. Thus, 81% of the treatment effect was evident with the lowest dose of chlorthalidone (12.5 mg per day) in 4 weeks. Two weeks after stopping the drug, 76% of the treatment effect persisted, suggesting that the treatment effect is long-acting. Previous diuretic use did not modify the primary end point (change from baseline −14.4 mm Hg [95% CI, −25.5 to −3.3] in loop diuretic nonusers [n=23] versus −14.0 mm Hg [95% CI, −19.6 to −8.3] in loop diuretic users [n=90]).Table.

Data on final 24-hour and daytime ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were imputed for 13 patients (4 placebo, 9 chlorthalidone) who had missing values for ambulatory BP. Data on nighttime BP were missing in 18 patients (6 placebo, 12 chlorthalidone), of which 17 were imputed because 1 was missing nighttime BP at baseline. The treatment effect is expressed as the mean difference with a 95% CI for all the variables except nocturnal dip in systolic BP, for which the effect is expressed as an odds ratio with a 95% CI. A nocturnal dip in systolic BP indicates a decrease >10% from the daytime value.Compared with placebo, the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the chlorthalidone group at 12 weeks was −54% (95% CI, −65% to −40%). Two weeks after the assigned regimen was discontinued, the percent change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio remained at −33% in the chlorthalidone group and −9% in the placebo group (between-group difference, −33% points [95% CI, −51% to −8%]).After randomization, hypokalemia (13.6% versus 0%), reversible increases in serum creatinine (51.8% versus 14.8%), hyperglycemia (18.6% versus 5.6%), dizziness (27.1% versus 20.4%), orthostatic hypotension (11.9% versus 3.7%), and hyperuricemia (23.7% versus 11.1%) occurred more frequently in the chlorthalidone group. From the time of randomization to the end of the trial, increases in the serum creatinine level >25% from baseline were strongly influenced by baseline loop diuretic use. The odds ratio associated with a 25% or greater increase in creatinine was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.1 to 18.3) among patients not on loop diuretics at baseline as compared with 8.5 (95% CI, 2.7 to 29.2) among those who were on loop diuretics at baseline. The difference did not reach the nominal level of statistical significance (P=0.078 for the treatment × loop diuretic interaction).In the general population, spironolactone is the standard of care for treating resistant hypertension.3 However, in a meta-analysis, spironolactone doubled the risk of hyperkalemia and quintupled the risk of gynecomastia compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (or both).4 In a randomized trial of patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate between 25 and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2, patiromer, a potassium binding polymer, enabled the use of spironolactone.5 However, even with patiromer, approximately one-third of patients administered spironolactone experienced hyperkalemia (K ≥5.5 mEq/L) over 12 weeks. Given the difficulty of using spironolactone, chlorthalidone is an attractive alternative to treat resistant hypertension in advanced CKD. An important advantage of chlorthalidone over spironolactone is that the risk of hyperkalemia is essentially nonexistent. However, hypokalemia becomes a concern. Serum creatinine, BP, blood glucose, and serum sodium would require careful monitoring.Data from patients with resistant hypertension in CLICK demonstrated that chlorthalidone effectively reduced both systolic and diastolic 24-hour ambulatory BP in stage 4 CKD independent of loop diuretic use. Chlorthalidone represents an attractive option for managing resistant hypertension in patients with advanced CKD.Article InformationREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02841280.Sources of FundingSupported by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute grant R01 HL126903 and the Indiana Institute for Medical Research.Nonstandard Abbreviations and AcronymsBPblood pressureCKDchronic kidney diseaseDisclosures Dr Agarwal reports personal fees and nonfinancial support from Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc, Akebia Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, and Vifor Pharma; has received personal fees from Lexicon and Reata; is a member of data safety monitoring committees for Vertex and Chinook, steering committees of randomized trials for Akebia Therapeutics, Bayer, and Relypsa, and adjudication committees for Bayer; has served as Associate Editor of the American Journal of Nephrology and Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation and has been an author for UpToDate; and has received research grants from the National Institutes of Health and the US Veterans Administration.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The need for palliative care in our health care system has exponentially increased in the past few years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aging population, and the increasing number of people living with serious illnesses. While nurses play a critical role in delivering palliative care, many lack confidence and knowledge, causing practice gaps in the clinical and psychological management of seriously ill patients. The collective burden of the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of palliative care education and training, specifically in communication, symptom management, and continuing education. All nurses, including nursing students, transitioning nurses, and practicing nurses, should be trained to offer generalist (or primary) palliative care, in accordance with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials: Core Competencies for Professional Nursing Education . Provision of holistic, relationship-based, and integrated palliative care for patients and their families is an ethical obligation for all nurses.

AB  - Importance Medication management and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are commonly used treatments for chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, little evidence is available comparing the effectiveness of these approaches. Objective To compare collaborative care medication optimization vs CBT on pain intensity, interference, and other pain-related outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants The Care Management for the Effective Use of Opioids (CAMEO) trial was a 12-month, comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. Recruitment of veterans with CLBP prescribed long-term opioids occurred at 7 Veterans Affairs primary care clinics from September 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014, and follow-up was completed December 31, 2015. Analyses were based on intention to treat in all randomized participants and were performed from March 22, 2015, to November 1, 2021. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive either collaborative care with nurse care manager–delivered medication optimization (MED group) (n = 131) or psychologist-delivered CBT (CBT group) (n = 130) for 6 months, with check-in visits at 9 months and final outcome assessment at 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) total score, a composite of the pain intensity and interference subscales at 6 (treatment completion) and 12 (follow-up completion) months. Scores on the BPI range from 0 to 10, with higher scores representing greater pain impact and a 30% improvement considered a clinically meaningful treatment response. Secondary outcomes included pain-related disability, pain catastrophizing, self-reported substance misuse, health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Results A total of 261 patients (241 [92.3%] men; mean [SD] age, 57.9 [9.5] years) were randomized and included in the analysis. Baseline mean (SD) BPI scores in the MED and CBT groups were 6.45 (1.79) and 6.49 (1.67), respectively. Improvements in BPI scores were significantly greater in the MED group at 12 months (between-group difference, −0.54 [95% CI, −1.18 to −0.31]; P = .04) but not at 6 months (between-group difference, −0.46 [95% CI, −0.94 to 0.11]; P = .07). Secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial among US veterans with CLBP who were prescribed long-term opioid therapy, collaborative care medication optimization was modestly more effective than CBT in reducing pain impact during the 12-month study. However, this difference may not be clinically meaningful or generalize to nonveteran populations. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01236521

AB  - We assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination impact on illness severity among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, August 2021-March 2022.We evaluated differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, in-hospital death, and length of stay among vaccinated (2 or 3 mRNA vaccine doses) versus unvaccinated patients aged ≥18 years hospitalized for ≥24 hours with COVID-19-like illness and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for ICU admission and death and subdistribution hazard ratios (SHR) for time to hospital discharge adjusted for age, geographic region, calendar time, and local virus circulation.We included 27 149 SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalizations. During both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, protection against ICU admission was strongest among 3-dose vaccinees compared with unvaccinated patients (Delta OR, 0.52 [95% CI, .28-.96]; Omicron OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .54-.87]). During both periods, risk of in-hospital death was lower among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated patients but ORs overlapped across vaccination strata. We observed SHR >1 across all vaccination strata in both periods indicating faster discharge for vaccinated patients.COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower rates of ICU admission and in-hospital death in both Delta and Omicron periods compared with being unvaccinated.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority. AD biomarkers may vary based on race, but the recruitment of diverse participants has been challenging.Three groups of Black and White participants with and without prior research advocacy or participation were interviewed individually or in focus groups to better understand perspectives related to AD biomarker research participation. A rapid qualitative data analytic approach was used to analyze the data.Identified barriers to AD biomarker research participation included hesitancy due to fear, distrust of research and researchers, lack of relevant knowledge, and lack of research test results disclosure. Drivers for engagement in biomarker research procedures included knowledge about research, AD, and related clinical procedures, perceived benefits of participation, and outreach from trusted sources.Participants' comments related to the need for diversity in research and desire for results disclosure suggest opportunities to engage Black individuals.Black Americans experience more salient barriers to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker research participation.Concerns about research diversity influence research participation decisions.Research test disclosure may affect research participation and retention.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed multiple weaknesses in the nation's public health system. Therefore, the American College of Medical Informatics selected "Rebuilding the Nation's Public Health Informatics Infrastructure" as the theme for its annual symposium. Experts in biomedical informatics and public health discussed strategies to strengthen the US public health information infrastructure through policy, education, research, and development. This article summarizes policy recommendations for the biomedical informatics community postpandemic. First, the nation must perceive the health data infrastructure to be a matter of national security. The nation must further invest significantly more in its health data infrastructure. Investments should include the education and training of the public health workforce as informaticians in this domain are currently limited. Finally, investments should strengthen and expand health data utilities that increasingly play a critical role in exchanging information across public health and healthcare organizations.

AB  - Collaborative treatment planning is a process by which mental healthcare providers and consumers of services work together to set goals for treatment, choose between alternative services, and establish a plan (c.f.). Several groups have attempted to increase the collaborative nature of treatment planning. Collaborative treatment planning seeks to empower consumers, increase investment in treatment, and Benhances his or her motivation, investment, self-esteem, and sense of achievement, leading to greater independence and self-mastery.^ A key outcome in collaborative treatment planning is the production of high-quality treatment goals. Substantial research has supported the importance of goal setting in increasing goal-related efforts and performance, and goal setting holds several potential benefits for rehabilitation efforts, such as improving consumer outcomes, supporting consumer autonomy, and meeting contractual obligations, and may serve as a meaningful outcome in-and-of itself. To this end, Clarke, Oades, Crowe, Caputi, and Deane found that the goal attainment mediated the relationship between symptom distress and self-rated recovery, thus providing an empirical link between goals and consumer recovery. Despite its promise, Levack and colleagues note that goal setting interventions have had inconsistent outcomes. They conclude that these results may, at least in part, be due to variability in the goal setting process, which can impact the quality and effectiveness of goals. Treatment plans are critical to collaborative coordination of mental health services, and the goals can represent an important indicator of shared decision-making within psychiatric rehabilitation. Moreover, treatment plans have intrinsic value as a means by which the treatment team communicates. Despite their importance, extant research indicates treatment plans are often neglected in practice. Research from the intellectual disability literature indicates that treatment plans are infrequently completed,

AB  - The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have established guidelines for the treatment and surveillance of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. Considering these guidelines, an accurate and efficient method is needed to measure receipt of care.The accuracy and completeness of Veterans Health Administration (VA) administrative data were assessed by comparing them with data manually abstracted during the Colorectal Cancer Care Collaborative (C4) quality improvement initiative for 618 patients with stage I-III CRC.The VA administrative data contained gender, marital, and birth information for all patients but race information was missing for 62.1% of patients. The percent agreement for demographic variables ranged from 98.1-100%. The kappa statistic for receipt of treatments ranged from 0.21 to 0.60 and there was a 96.9% agreement for the date of surgical resection. The percentage of post-diagnosis surveillance events in C4 also in VA administrative data were 76.0% for colonoscopy, 84.6% for physician visit, and 26.3% for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test.VA administrative data are accurate and complete for non-race demographic variables, receipt of CRC treatment, colonoscopy, and physician visits; but alternative data sources may be necessary to capture patient race and receipt of CEA tests.

AB  - BACKGROUND There are 250,000 cases of central line–associated blood stream infections in the United States annually, some of which may be prevented by the removal of lines that are no longer needed. OBJECTIVE To test the performance of criteria to identify an idle line as a guideline to facilitate its removal. METHODS Patients with central lines on the wards were identified. Criteria for justified use were defined. If none were met, the line was considered “idle.” We proposed the guideline that a line may be removed the day following the first idle day and compared actual practice with our proposed guideline. RESULTS One hundred twenty‐six lines in 126 patients were observed. Eighty‐three (65.9%) were peripherally inserted central catheters. Twenty‐seven percent (n= 34) were placed for antibiotics. Seventy‐six patients had lines removed prior to discharge. In these patients, the line was in place for 522 days, of which 32.7% were idle. The most common reasons to justify the line included parenteral antibiotics and meeting systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criteria. In 11 (14.5%) patients, the line was removed prior to the proposed guideline. Most (n = 36, 47.4%) line removals were observed to be in accordance with our guideline. In another 29 (38.2%), line removal was delayed compared to our guideline. CONCLUSIONS Idle days are common. Central line days may be reduced by the consistent daily reevaluation of a line's justification using defined criteria. The practice of routine central line placement for prolonged antibiotics and the inclusion of SIRS criteria to justify the line may need to be reevaluated.

AB  - The principle of compatibility suggests that specific attitudes should target specific behaviors. The attitude-behavior relationship is contingent upon the consistency between the two.This aim of this study was to examine the strength of relationships involving general versus specific support perceptions and attitudes regarding smart pump technology in hospitals. Specifically, we hypothesized that organizational support perceptions would be more strongly related to general positive work attitudes than it would to smart pump satisfaction. We also hypothesized that smart pump-specific support would be more strongly related to smart pump satisfaction than it would to general positive work attitudes.Data were collected in a cross-sectional field study via online surveys at two large, public hospital systems in the Midwestern United States, one in Iowa (n = 311 nurses) and one in Wisconsin (n = 346 nurses). Because nurses in one system had more experience with smart pump technology than nurses in the other system, analyses were run separately to compare results across the two sites.Consistent with the principle of compatibility, hierarchical regression revealed across both sites that smart pump support had a stronger relationship with smart pump satisfaction whereas general organizational support perceptions had a stronger relationship with general positive work attitudes. In addition, moderation effects were present in one sample where high levels of the noncompatible support (e.g., smart pump-specific support on positive workplace attitudes) buffered low levels of compatible support.Our findings highlight the contextual importance of support in regard to the growing technological transformations that health care systems currently experience. When specific forms of support are provided for specific technologies, end-users will generally respond more favorably compared to when general support is the only available resource.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of physician specialty regarding diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) and assess the clinical status of patients initiating new treatment for FM using data from Real-World Examination of Fibromyalgia: Longitudinal Evaluation of Costs and Treatments.Outpatients from 58 sites in the United States were enrolled. Data were collected via in-office surveys and telephone interviews. Pairwise comparisons by specialty were made using chi-square, Fisher's exact tests, and Student's t-tests.Physician specialist cohorts included rheumatologists (n=54), primary care physicians (n=25), and a heterogeneous group of physicians practicing pain or physical medicine, psychiatry, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathy, or an unspecified specialty (n=12). The rheumatologists expressed higher confidence diagnosing FM (4.5 on a five-point scale) than primary care physicians (4.1) (P=0.037). All cohorts strongly agreed that recognizing FM is their responsibility. They agreed that psychological aspects of FM are important, but disagreed that symptoms are psychosomatic. All physician cohorts agreed with a multidisciplinary approach including nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, although physicians were more confident prescribing medications than alternative therapies. Most patients reported moderate to severe pain, multiple comorbidities, and treatment with several medications and nonpharmacologic therapies.Physician practice characteristics, physician attitudes, and FM patient profiles were broadly similar across specialties. The small but significant differences reported by physicians and patients across physician cohorts suggest that despite published guidelines, treatment of FM still contains important variance across specialties.

AB  - Based on an organization theory perspective, this study proposes that nurses not only consider how infusion pumps place demands on themselves but also consider how infusion pumps place demands on patients. Results from a sample of nurses in a large, public authority, nonprofit teaching hospital located in the midwestern United States indicate that “demanding formalization for nurses” and “demanding formalization for patients” are 2 empirically distinct constructs. Demanding formalization for patients was a stronger predictor of infusion pump-related attitudes, in addition to trust and pay satisfaction. Demanding formalization for nurses was a stronger predictor of job satisfaction, turnover intention, and burnout.

AB  - Describe obstetrical providers' management of a hypothetical case on chronic pain in pregnancy and determine whether practices differ based on patient race.This was a self-administered survey at a clinical conference.Seventy-six obstetrician-gynecologists and one nurse practitioner were surveyed.A case-vignette described a pregnant patient presenting with worsening chronic lower back pain, requesting an opioid refill and increased dosage. We varied patient race (black/white) across two randomly assigned identical vignettes. Providers indicated their likelihood of prescribing opioids, drug testing, and referring on a 0 (definitely would not) to 10 (definitely would) scale; rated their suspicions/concerns about the patient on a 0-10 VAS scale; and ranked those concerns in order of importance. We calculated correlation coefficients, stratifying analyses by patient race.Providers were not inclined to refill the opioid prescription (median = 3.0) or increase the dose (median = 1.0). They were more likely to conduct urine drug tests on white than black patients ( P = 0.008) and more likely to suspect that white patients would divert the medication ( P =0.021). For white patients, providers' highest-ranked concern was the patient's risk of abuse/addiction, whereas, for black patients, it was harm to the fetus. Suspicion about symptom exaggeration was more closely related to decisions about refilling the opioid prescriptions and increasing the dose for black patients (r = -0.357, -0.439, respectively), whereas these decisions were more closely correlated with concerns about overdose for white patients (r = -0.406, -0.494, respectively).Provider suspicion and concerns may differ by patient race, which may relate to differences in pain treatment and testing. Further study is warranted to better understand how chronic pain is managed in pregnancy.

AB  - Prescribers commonly receive alerts during medication ordering. Prescribers work in a complex, time-pressured environment; to enhance the effectiveness of safety alerts, the effort needed to cognitively process these alerts should be minimized. Methods to evaluate the extent to which computerized alerts support prescribers’ information processing are lacking. To develop a methodological protocol to assess the extent to which alerts support prescribers’ information processing at-a-glance; specifically, the incorporation of information into their working memory. We hypothesized that the method would be feasible and that we would be able to detect a significant difference in prescribers’ information processing with a revised alert display that incorporates warning design guidelines compared to the original alert display. A counterbalanced, within-subject study was conducted with 20 prescribers in a human-computer interaction laboratory. We tested a single alert that was displayed in two different ways. Prescribers were informed that an alert would appear for 10 s. After the alert was shown, a white screen was displayed, and prescribers were asked to verbally describe what they saw; indicate how many total warnings; and describe anything else they remembered about the alert. We measured information processing via the accuracy of prescribers’ free recall and their ability to identify that three warning messages were present. Two analysts independently evaluated participants’ responses against a comprehensive catalog of alert elements and then discussed discrepancies until reaching consensus. This feasibility study demonstrated that the method seemed to be effective for evaluating prescribers’ information processing of medication alert displays. With this method, we were able to detect significant differences in prescribers’ recall of alert information. The proportion of total data elements that prescribers were able to accurately recall was significantly greater for the revised versus original alert display (p = 0.006). With the revised display, more prescribers accurately reported that three warnings were shown (p = 0.002). The methodological protocol was feasible for evaluating the alert display and yielded important findings on prescribers’ information processing. Study methods supplement traditional usability evaluation methods and may be useful for evaluating information processing of other healthcare technologies.

AB  - Patterns of healthcare encounters by patients in each stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been fully described.This study describes patterns of healthcare resource use by patients with CKD.A retrospective descriptive design was used.Patients with Stages 1-5 CKD were identified in five existing de-identified healthcare insurance claims databases in the United States using codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM).The databases contained more than 23,660,000 claims records from over 11 million subscribers who were continuously enrolled in a single 2014 health plan. All CKD patients' 2014 claims were extracted, yielding 1,987 unique people with 110,594 healthcare encounters.Healthcare resources are used to manage the causes of CKD and its multiple effects on health, and thus the number of healthcare encounters among people with more advanced disease was, as expected, relatively higher. There were more hospitalisations, emergency department visits and specialist encounters in this group. Surprisingly, however, even people in earlier stages of kidney disease experienced a median of 14-17 healthcare encounters during a single calendar year.Understanding patterns of healthcare encounters provides important information about the transition experiences of patients with CKD. Exploring ways to reduce the risks associated with transitions in care may prevent problems with home medication management, frequent emergency department visits and potentially avoidable hospitalisations.

AB  - Limited resources are available to educate health professionals on cultural considerations and specific healthcare needs of Burmese refugees. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a module focused on cross-cultural considerations when caring for Burmese refugees.A brief educational module using anonymously tracked pre- and post-intervention, self-administered surveys was developed and studied. The surveys measured pediatric and family medicine residents' knowledge, attitudes, and comfort in caring for Burmese refugees. Paired t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables were used to test pre- and post-intervention differences. We included open-ended questions for residents to describe their experiences with the Burmese population.The survey was available to 173 residents. Forty-four pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed (response rate of 25%). Resident comfort in caring for Burmese increased significantly after the module (P = 0.04). Resident knowledge of population-specific cultural information increased regarding ethnic groups (P = 0.004), appropriate laboratory use (P = 0.04), and history gathering (P = 0.001). Areas of improved resident attitudes included comprehension of information from families (P = 0.03) and length of time required with interpreter (P = 0.01). Thematic evaluation of qualitative data highlighted four themes: access to interpreter and resources, verbal communication, nonverbal communication, and relationship building with cultural considerations.A brief intervention for residents has the potential to improve knowledge, attitudes, and comfort in caring for Burmese patients. Interventions focused on cultural considerations in medical care may improve cultural competency when caring for vulnerable patient populations.

AB  - Medical students learn about death, dying, and palliative care (DDPC) through formal curricular offerings and informal clinical experiences; however, the lessons learned in the clinic may be at odds with the formal curriculum. Reflective writing is a means for students to "bracket" their DDPC experiences and reconcile conflicts between the formal and informal curriculum.The aim of this study is to compare the level of reflection demonstrated in medical students' narratives on DDPC with other experiences and to examine the domains of professionalism that students perceive to be prevalent in their DDPC experiences.Third-year medical students submitted professionalism narratives during their internal medicine clerkship. We identified a subset of narratives related to DDPC (n = 388) and randomly selected control narratives (n = 153). We assessed the level of reflection demonstrated in the narratives using a validated rubric and analyzed the professionalism domains that students identified as relevant to their experience.There was no difference in reflective level between DDPC and control narratives. Within the DDPC group, female students demonstrated higher reflection (2.24 ± 0.71) than male students (2.01 ± 0.77; P < .001). Caring, compassion and communication, and honor and integrity were prominent among DDPC narratives. More females identified caring, compassion, and communication as relevant to their DDPC experiences, whereas more males identified altruism.Males and females have different perceptions of DDPC experiences, and female students appear to be more deeply impacted. These findings can help clinical faculty engage students more effectively with this challenging topic.

AB  - Despite unprecedented spending, US maternal outcomes have worsened drastically over the past decade. In comparison, maternal outcomes of many Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) have improved. Lessons learnt by their success may be applicable to the US. We performed a literature review to identify innovations that had met with success across LMIC, and should be considered for adoption in the US. mHealth and patient facing alerts, Telehealth, patient controlled health records, inclusion of patient relationship data in health information systems and positioning empowered community health workers as catalysts of maternal care delivery were identified as innovations worthy of further evaluation. These innovations were categorized into several themes; knowledge, technology, patient/community empowerment, coordination and process change. Tools that place informed and empowered patients and community members at the center of maternal care has greatly improved maternal outcomes, and are suitable to be considered for the US healthcare system.

AB  - The decision to implant a cardiac device in a person with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia requires considering the possible trade-offs of quality of life (QOL) and quantity of life. This study measured the decision-making experience of patients with and without cognitive impairment (CI) who received a cardiac device and their family members who were involved in the decision.Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were administered with 15 patient-family member dyads. Interviews revealed few conversations between physicians, patients and family members about the patient's cognitive status or about the benefits, risks, and long-term implications of the device for someone with CI. Participants largely stated that the decision to get the device was based on the patient's functional status at the time of the implant, and not on expectations about future functioning. Patients with CI had more regret, measured with the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), (p=0.037) and family members of patients without CI reported more decisional conflict, measured with the Decisional Conflict Scale (p=0.057).Although CI impacts life expectancy and QOL, cognitive status was largely not discussed prior to device implant. Few differences were found between the experiences of dyads that included patients with or without CI.

It is unclear whether these changes also occur in Caucasians. Methods A secondary data analysis using electronic medical records from 5228 African‐Americans and Caucasians aged ≥65 years was carried out. Mixed effects models with repeated serum glucose measurements were used to compare changes in glucose levels between African‐Americans and Caucasian patients with and without incident dementia. Results African‐Americans and Caucasians with diabetes had significantly different changes in glucose levels by dementia status ( P &lt; .0001). African‐Americans experienced a significant decline in glucose levels before the dementia diagnosis (estimated glucose decline 1.3421 mg/dL per year, P &lt; .0001) than those who did not develop dementia. Caucasians with and without dementia showed stable glucose levels over time ( P = .3071). Discussion Significant changes in glucose levels precede dementia in African‐American patients with diabetes but not in Caucasians.

AB  - Abstract Objective We describe and evaluate the mapping of computerized tomography (CT) terms from 40 hospitals participating in a health information exchange (HIE) to a standard terminology. Methods Proprietary CT exam terms and corresponding exam frequency data were obtained from 40 participant HIE sites that transmitted radiology data to the HIE from January 2013 through October 2015. These terms were mapped to the Logical Observations Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®) terminology using the Regenstrief LOINC mapping assistant (RELMA) beginning in January 2016. Terms without initial LOINC match were submitted to LOINC as new term requests on an ongoing basis. After new LOINC terms were created, proprietary terms without an initial match were reviewed and mapped to these new LOINC terms where appropriate. Content type and token coverage were calculated for the LOINC version at the time of initial mapping (v2.54) and for the most recently released version at the time of our analysis (v2.63). Descriptive analysis was performed to assess for significant differences in content-dependent coverage between the 2 versions. Results LOINC’s content type and token coverages of HIE CT exam terms for version 2.54 were 83% and 95%, respectively. Two-hundred-fifteen new LOINC CT terms were created in the interval between the releases of version 2.54 and 2.63, and content type and token coverages, respectively, increased to 93% and 99% (P &amp;lt; .001). Conclusion LOINC’s content type coverage of proprietary CT terms across 40 HIE sites was 83% but improved significantly to 93% following new term creation.

AB  - This study sought to quantify the association between event notifications and subsequent query-based health information exchange (HIE) use among end users of three different community health information organizations.Using system-log data merged with user characteristics, regression-adjusted estimates were used to describe the association between event notifications and subsequent query-based HIE usage.Approximately 5% of event notifications were associated with query-based HIE usage within 30 days. In adjusted models, odds of query-based HIE usage following an event notification were higher for older patients and for alerts triggered by a discharge event. Query-based HIE usage was more common among specialty clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers than primary care organizations.In this novel combination of data, 1 in 20 event notifications resulted in subsequent query-based HIE usage. Results from this study suggest that event notifications and query-based HIE can be applied together to address clinical and population health use cases.

AB  - As interest in global health education continues to increase, residency programs seeking to accommodate learners’ expectations for global health learning opportunities often face challenges providing high-quality global health training. To address these challenges, some residency programs collaborate across medical specialties to create interdisciplinary global health residency tracks or collaborative interdisciplinary global health tracks (CIGHTs). In this Perspective, the authors highlight the unique aspects of interdisciplinary tracks that may benefit residency programs by describing 3 established U.S.-based programs as models: those at Indiana University, Mount Sinai Hospital, and the University of Virginia. Through collaboration and economies of scale, CIGHTs are able to address some of the primary challenges inherent to traditional global health tracks: lack of institutional faculty support and resources, the need to develop a global health curriculum, a paucity of safe and mentored international rotations, and inconsistent resident interest. Additionally, most published global health learning objectives and competencies (e.g., ethics of global health work, predeparture training) are not discipline specific and can therefore be addressed across departments—which, in turn, adds to the feasibility of CIGHTs. Beyond simply sharing the administrative burden, however, the interdisciplinary learning central to CIGHTs provides opportunities for trainees to gain new perspectives in approaching global health not typically afforded in traditional global health track models. Residency program leaders looking to implement or modify their global health education offerings, particularly those with limited institutional support, might consider developing a CIGHT as an approach that leverages economies of scale and provides new opportunities for collaboration.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune neurological disorder that is characterized by symmetrical progressive worsening or relapsing weakness and numbness of the limbs. There are no reliable diagnostic tests or definitive diagnostic criteria, and the diagnosis remains one of excluding other cases of polyneuropathy. Typical treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange. Little is known about CIDP as a treatment complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab and nivolumab). This report will be helpful in increasing awareness and knowledge about this unique entity.We describe two cases of CIDP secondary to treatment with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma that were successfully treated with prednisone and IVIG. Conclusion and Relevance: This report illustrates that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to CIDP that can be successfully treated with complete resolution of symptoms. CIDP secondary to checkpoint inhibitors may have unique features such as low-grade lymphocytic pleocytosis on CSF evaluation as well as severe neuropathic pain as an early presenting symptom. Additionally, it is interesting to note that both patients presented in this report remained melanoma-free on follow-up more than 16 months later.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their caregivers require cognitive and behavioral symptom management, interdisciplinary care, support for caregivers, and seamless care coordination between providers. Caring for someone with ADRD or TBI is associated with higher rates of psychological morbidity and burden, social isolation, financial hardship, and deterioration of physical health. Tremendous need exists for primary care–based interventions that concurrently address the care needs of dyads and aim to improve care and outcomes for both individuals with ADRD and TBI and their family caregivers. Methods The Aging Brain Care Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths (ABC ANSWERS) study is a randomized controlled trial that tests the effectiveness of an intervention based on two evidence-based programs that have been developed for and previously tested in populations with ADRD, TBI, stroke, and late-life depression and/or who have survived an intensive care unit stay. This study includes 200 dyads comprised of a veteran with a diagnosis of ADRD or TBI and the veteran’s primary informal caregiver. Dyads are randomized to receive the ABC ANSWERS intervention or routine Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care with a standardized educational and resource information packet. Data collection occurs at baseline and three follow-up time points (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). The primary outcome is caregiver quality of life (QoL). A secondary measure for the caregiver is caregiver burden. Secondary measures for both the veteran and caregiver include symptoms of depression and anxiety. Discussion The ABC ANSWERS intervention integrates common features of an evidence-based collaborative care model for brain health while concurrently attending to the implementation barriers of delivering care and skills to dyads. We hypothesize that caregivers in dyads randomized to the ABC ANSWERS program will experience higher levels of QoL and lower levels of depression, anxiety, dyadic strain, and caregiver burden at 12 months than those receiving usual VHA primary care.

AB  - To design PARTNER-MH, a peer-led, patient navigation program for implementation in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health care settings, we conducted a pre-implementation evaluation during intervention development to assess stakeholders’ views of the intervention and to explore implementation factors critical to its future adoption. This is a convergent mixed-methods study that involved qualitative semi-structured interviews and survey data. Data collection was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We interviewed and administered the surveys to 23 peers and 10 supervisors from 12 midwestern VHA facilities. We used deductive and inductive approaches to analyze the qualitative data. We also conducted descriptive analysis and Fisher Exact Test to compare peers and supervisors’ survey responses. We triangulated findings to refine the intervention. Overall, participants viewed PARTNER-MH favorably. However, they saw the intervention’s focus on minority Veterans and social determinants of health framework as potential barriers, believing this could negatively affect the packaging of the intervention, complicate its delivery process, and impact its adoption. They also viewed clinic structures, available resources, and learning climate as potential barriers. Peers and supervisors’ selections and discussions of CFIR items were similar. Our findings informed PARTNER-MH development and helped identify factors that could impact its implementation. This project is responsive to the increasing recognition of the need to incorporate implementation science in healthcare disparities research. Understanding the resistance to the intervention’s focus on minority Veterans and the potential barriers presented by contextual factors positions us to adjust the intervention prior to testing, in an effort to maximize implementation success.

AB  - Deprescribing is one way to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy in older adult patients. Although algorithms have been published to guide practitioners in deprescribing, it is still unknown how applicable these algorithms are to the general older adult population. The primary objective was to assess the applicability of published deprescribing protocols in hospitalized older adult patients. This retrospective study included patients aged 65 years or greater who were discharged from an internal medicine team between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Along with age and admission to internal medicine wards, other eligibility criteria were extracted from published deprescribing protocols. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients eligible for deprescribing based on published algorithms. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients receiving medications which were included in an algorithm, proportion of patients using medications included in the algorithms who were eligible for deprescribing, and proportion of patients with medications deprescribed during the hospital stay. Two hundred sixty-seven patients were included and 124 (46.4%) used a medication with a published deprescribing algorithm. Thirty-four percent of all patients and 74% (92/124) of patients prescribed medications included in algorithms were eligible for deprescribing. Seven percent (6/92) of patients eligible for deprescribing had medications deprescribed during the hospital stay. The application of deprescribing algorithms in hospitalized older adults identified a significant opportunity to initiate deprescribing practices.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP) affects more than 40% of adults aged 50 years and older and is the leading cause of disability in the USA. Older adults with chronic MSP are at risk for analgesic-related side effects, long-term opioid use, and functional decline. Recognizing the burden of chronic MSP, reducing the transition from acute to chronic pain is a public health priority. In this paper, we report the protocol for the Brief EducaTional Tool to Enhance Recovery (BETTER) trial. This trial compares two versions of an intervention to usual care for preventing the transition from acute to chronic MSP among older adults in the emergency department (ED). Methods Three hundred sixty patients from the ED will be randomized to one of three arms : full intervention (an interactive educational video about pain medications and recovery-promoting behaviors, a telecare phone call from a nurse 48 to 72 h after discharge from the ED, and an electronic communication containing clinical information to the patient’s primary care provider); video-only intervention (the interactive educational video but no telecare or primary care provider communication); or usual care . Data collection will occur at baseline and at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome is a composite measure of pain severity and interference. Secondary outcomes include physical function, overall health, opioid use, healthcare utilization, and an assessment of the economic value of the intervention. Discussion This trial is the first patient-facing ED-based intervention aimed at helping older adults to better manage their MSP and reduce their risk of developing chronic pain. If effective, future studies will examine the effectiveness of implementation strategies. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04118595 . Registered on 8 October 2019.

AB  - Abstract Background Attitudes and beliefs about massage therapy have been explored among health professionals and health profession students, but not for undergraduate preprofessional health sciences students. Methods This cross-sectional survey sought to determine pre-professional health students’ attitudes and perceptions toward massage therapy and determine the extent demographic variables such as age, gender, race, along with lifetime massage experience are associated with neutral/negative perceptions. Results N = 129 undergraduate students completed the Attitudes Toward Massage scale and 7 supplemental items pertaining to sexuality and therapist gender preference along with questions regarding lifetime massage utilization. Prevalence of massage therapy utilization was 35.6% (lifetime) and 18.6% (last 12-months). Overall, positive attitudes towards massage therapy was observed with participants reporting massage experience expressing more positive massage attitudes (lifetime; p = 0.0081, the past 12 months; p = 0.0311). Participants with no massage experience were more likely to report neutral/negative attitudes toward massage ( p = 0.04). Men were more likely to prefer their massage therapist to be of the opposite sex (38.9%) compared to women (2.1%) ( p = &lt; 0.0001). Men were less confident than women in their concern of becoming sexually aroused during massage ( p = 0.0001) and in the belief that massage is sexually arousing ( p = 0.048). Both genders expressed comfort with female and/or male massage therapists, but if given a choice, both prefer a female massage therapist. Conclusions Undergraduate pre-professional health sciences students have generally positive attitudes towards massage therapy however more research is needed regarding implicit gender bias and/or preferences. This work should inform future research designs examining the impact of attitudes and beliefs on patient referrals to massage therapy.

AB  - Affective states, such as feelings of anger and excitement, are linked to health outcomes and behaviors. The benefits of physical activity for individual affect is known; however, how affect influences physical activity participation is less understood. Using Whittemore and Knafl's framework, this integrative review examines the influence of affect on adult physical activity. using six databases, 19 articles published between 1997 and 2019. Themes found include support for the influence of positive affect on increased physical activity, a temporal aspect of affect, a variety of measurement tools, and varying uses of theoretical frameworks across studies. Advanced practice nurses and registered nurses may improve patient health behaviors, such as physical activity, by incorporating affect-focused assessments. Review findings support consideration of affect in physical activity counseling. Further research using theory-driven methods and consistent affect assessments is needed to test the complex relationship between affect and physical activity.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments for treating chronic pain. However, the predominant MBI, mindfulness-based stress reduction, has features that pose significant implementation barriers.This study will test two approaches to delivering MBIs for improving Veterans' chronic pain and mental health comorbidities. These two approaches address key implementation barriers.We will conduct a four-site, three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Learning to Apply Mindfulness to Pain (LAMP), to test the effectiveness of two MBIs at improving pain and mental health comorbidities. Mobile+Group LAMP consists of prerecorded modules presented by a mindfulness instructor that are viewed in an online group setting and interspersed with discussions led by a facilitator. Mobile LAMP consists of the same prerecorded modules but does not include a group component. We will test whether either of these MBIs will be more effective than usual care at improving chronic pain and whether the Mobile+Group LAMP will be more effective than Mobile LAMP at improving chronic pain. Comparisons for the primary hypotheses will be conducted with continuous outcomes (Brief Pain Inventory interference score) repeated at 10 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. The secondary hypotheses are that Mobile+Group LAMP and Mobile LAMP will be more effective than usual care at improving secondary outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression). We will also confirm the comparisons for the primary and secondary hypotheses in gender-specific strata.This trial is expected to result in two approaches for delivering MBIs that will optimize engagement, adherence, and sustainability and be able to reach large numbers of Veterans.

AB  - With increasing and extensive use of electronic health records (EHR), clinicians are often challenged in retrieving relevant patient information efficiently and effectively to arrive at a diagnosis. While using the search function built into an EHR can be more useful than browsing in a voluminous patient record, it is cumbersome and repetitive to search for the same or similar information on similar patients. To address this challenge, there is a critical need to build effective recommender systems that can recommend search terms to clinicians accurately. In this study, we developed a hybrid collaborative filtering model to recommend search terms for a specific patient to a clinician. The model draws on information from patients' clinical encounters and the searches that were performed during them. To generate recommendations, the model uses search terms which are (1) frequently co-occurring with the ICD codes recorded for the patient and (2) highly relevant to the most recent search terms. In one variation of the model (Hybrid Collaborative Filtering Method for Healthcare, or HCFMH), we use only the most recent ICD codes assigned to the patient, and in the other (Co-occurrence Pattern based HCFMH, or cpHCFMH), all ICD codes. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model. These experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods for top-N search term recommendation on different data sets.

AB  - Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have impaired physical, psychological, and social functions, which can diminish patient quality of life, burden family caregivers, and increase health-care utilization. For those with a life expectancy of less than six months, these impairments and their downstream effects can be addressed effectively through high-quality hospice care, delivered by multidisciplinary teams and focused on the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual wellbeing of patients and caregivers, with a goal of improving quality of life.In this review, we examine the evidence supporting hospice for ESLD, we compare this evidence to that supporting hospice more broadly, and we identify potential criteria that may be useful in determining hospice appropriateness.Despite the potential for hospice to improve care for those at the end of life, it is underutilized for patients with ESLD. Increasing the appropriate utilization of hospice for ESLD requires a better understanding of patient eligibility, which can be based on predictors of high short-term mortality and liver transplant ineligibility. Such hospice criteria should be data-driven and should accommodate the uncertainty faced by patients and physicians.

AB  - This research extracted patient-reported symptoms from free-text EHR notes of colorectal and breast cancer patients and studied the correlation of the symptoms with comorbid type 2 diabetes, race, and smoking status. An NLP framework was developed first to use UMLS MetaMap to extract all symptom terms from the 366,398 EHR clinical notes of 1694 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 3458 breast cancer (BC) patients. Semantic analysis and clustering algorithms were then developed to categorize all the relevant symptoms into eight symptom clusters defined by seed terms. After all the relevant symptoms were extracted from the EHR clinical notes, the frequency of the symptoms reported from colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) patients over three time-periods post-chemotherapy was calculated. Logistic regression (LR) was performed with each symptom cluster as the response variable while controlling for diabetes, race, and smoking status. The results show that the CRC and BC patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) were more likely to report symptoms than CRC and BC without T2D over three time-periods in the cancer trajectory. We also found that current smokers were more likely to report anxiety (CRC, BC), neuropathic symptoms (CRC, BC), anxiety (BC), and depression (BC) than non-smokers.

AB  - This study examined sociodemographic factors, cisplatin-related adverse health outcomes (AHO), and cumulative burden of morbidity (CBMPt) scores associated with medication use for anxiety and/or depression in testicular cancer survivors (TCS).A total of 1,802 TCS who completed cisplatin-based chemotherapy ≥12 months previously completed questionnaires regarding sociodemographic features and cisplatin-related AHOs [hearing impairment, tinnitus, peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN), and kidney disease]. A CBMPt score encompassed the number and severity of cisplatin-related AHOs. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the relationship of individual AHOs and CBMPt with medication use for anxiety and/or depression.A total of 151 TCS (8.4%) used medications for anxiety and/or depression. No cisplatin-related AHOs were reported by 511 (28.4%) participants, whereas 622 (34.5%), 334 (18.5%), 287 (15.9%), and 48 (2.7%), respectively, had very low, low, medium, and high CBMPt scores. In the multivariable model, higher CBMPt scores were significantly associated with medication use for anxiety and/or depression (P < 0.0001). In addition, tinnitus (P = 0.0009), PSN (P = 0.02), and having health insurance (P = 0.05) were significantly associated with greater use of these medications, whereas being employed (P = 0.0005) and vigorous physical activity (P = 0.01) were significantly associated with diminished use.TCS with higher CBMPt scores had a higher probability of using medications for anxiety and/or depression, and conversely, those who were employed and physically active tended to have reduced use of these medications.Healthcare providers should encourage TCS to increase physical activity to improve both physical and mental health. Rehabilitation programs should assess work-related skills and provide career development counseling/training.

AB  - Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population.This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting.Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics.Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years.The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

AB  - Decision-making about when to stop driving for older adults involves assessment of driving risk, availability of support or resources, and strong emotions about loss of independence. Although the risk of being involved in a fatal crash increases with age, driving cessation can negatively impact an older adult's health and well-being. Decision aids can enhance the decision-making process by increasing knowledge of the risks and benefits of driving cessation and improve decision quality. The impact of decision aids regarding driving cessation for older adults is unknown.The Advancing Understanding of Transportation Options (AUTO) study is a multi-site, two-armed randomized controlled trial that will test the impact of a decision aid on older adults' decisions about changes in driving behaviors and cessation. AUTO will enroll 300 drivers age ≥ 70 years with a study partner (identified by each driver); the dyads will be randomized into two groups (n = 150/group). The decision aid group will view the web-based decision aid created by Healthwise at baseline and the control group will review information about driving that does not include evidence-based elements on risks and benefits and values clarification about driving decisions. The AUTO trial will compare the effect of the decision aid, versus control, on a) immediate decision quality (measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale; primary outcome); b) longitudinal psychosocial outcomes at 12 and 24 months (secondary outcomes); and c) longitudinal driving behaviors (including reduction or cessation) at 12 and 24 months (secondary outcomes). Planned stratified analyses will examine the effects in subgroups defined by cognitive function, decisional capacity, and readiness to stop driving.The AUTO study is the first large-scale randomized trial of a driving decision aid for older adults. Results from this study will directly inform clinical practice about how best to support older adults in decision-making about driving.ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT04141891 .

AB  - Practice guidelines recommend that most patients receive moderate- or high-potency statins after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) of atherosclerotic origin. We tested the association of different patterns of potency for prescribed statin therapy—assessed before admission and at hospital discharge for ischemic stroke or TIA—on mortality in a large, nationwide sample of US Veterans.The study population included patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA occurring during 2011 at any of the 134 Veterans Health Administration facilities. We used electronic outpatient pharmacy files to identify statin dose at hospital admission and within 7 days after hospital discharge. We categorized statin dosing as low, moderate, or high potency; moderate or high potency was considered at goal. We created 6 mutually exclusive groups to reflect patterns of statin potency from hospital admission to discharge: goal to goal, low to goal, goal to low or goal to none (deintensification), none to none, none to low, and low to low. We used logistic regression to compare 30-day and 1-year mortality across statin potency groups.The population included 9380 predominately White (71.1%) men (96.3%) who were hospitalized for stroke or TIA. In this sample, 34.1% of patients (n=3194) were discharged off a statin medication. Deintensification occurred in 14.0% of patients (n=1312) and none to none in 20.5% (n=1924). Deintensification and none to none were associated with a higher odds of mortality as compared with goal to goal (adjusted odds ratio 1-year mortality: deintensification versus goal to goal, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02–1.57]; none to none versus goal to goal, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.30–1.93]). Adjustments for differences in baseline characteristics using propensity weighted scores demonstrated similar results.Underutilization of statins, including no treatment or underdosing after stroke (deintensification), was observed in approximately one-third of veterans with ischemic stroke or TIA and was associated with higher mortality when compared with patients who were at goal for statin prescription dosing.

AB  - POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) is a medical order form used to document preferences about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), medical interventions such as hospitalization, care in the intensive care unit, and/or ventilation, as well as artificial nutrition. Programs based on the POLST paradigm are used in virtually every state under names that include POST (Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment), MOLST (Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment), and MOST (Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment), and these forms are used in the care of hundreds of thousands of geriatric patients every year. Although POLST is intended for persons who are at risk of a life-threatening clinical event due to a serious life-limiting medical condition, some nursing homes and residential care settings use POLST to document CPR preferences for all residents, resulting in potentially inappropriate use with patients who are ineligible because they are too healthy. This article focuses on reasons that POLST is used as a default code status order form, the risks associated with this practice, and recommendations for nursing homes to implement appropriate use of POLST.

AB  - Abstract Objective Although vast amounts of patient information are captured in electronic health records (EHRs), effective clinical use of this information is challenging due to inadequate and inefficient access to it at the point of care. The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the literature on the use of EHR search functions within a single patient's record in clinical settings to characterize the current state of research on the topic and identify areas for future study. Methods We conducted a literature search of four databases to identify articles on within-EHR search functions or the use of EHR search function in the context of clinical tasks. After reviewing titles and abstracts and performing a full-text review of selected articles, we included 17 articles in the analysis. We qualitatively identified themes in those articles and synthesized the literature for each theme. Results Based on the 17 articles analyzed, we delineated four themes: (1) how clinicians use search functions, (2) impact of search functions on clinical workflow, (3) weaknesses of current search functions, and (4) advanced search features. Our review found that search functions generally facilitate patient information retrieval by clinicians and are positively received by users. However, existing search functions have weaknesses, such as yielding false negatives and false positives, which can decrease trust in the results, and requiring a high cognitive load to perform an inclusive search of a patient's record. Conclusion Despite the widespread adoption of EHRs, only a limited number of articles describe the use of EHR search functions in a clinical setting, despite evidence that they benefit clinician workflow and productivity. Some of the weaknesses of current search functions may be addressed by enhancing EHR search functions with collaborative filtering.

AB  - Summary Objective: To summarize significant research contributions on managing pandemics with health informatics published in 2020. Methods: An extensive search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published in 2020 that examined health informatics systems used during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. Results: Selected best papers represent the important and diverse ways that health informatics supported clinical and public health responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Selected papers represent four groups of papers: 1) Use of analytics to screen, triage, and manage patients; 2) Use of telehealth and remote monitoring to manage patients and populations; 3) Use of EHR systems and administrative systems to manage internal operations of a hospital or health system; and 4) Use of informatics methods and systems by public health authorities to capture, store, manage, and visualize population-level data and information. Conclusion: Health informatics played a critical role in managing patients and populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care and public health organizations both leveraged available information systems and standards to rapidly identify cases, triage infected individuals, and monitor population trends. The selected best papers represent a fraction of the body of knowledge stemming from COVID-19, most of which is focused on pandemic response. Future work will be needed to help the world recover from the pandemic and strengthen the health information infrastructure in preparation for the next pandemic.

AB  - Abstract Background Community health workers (CHWs) can increase access to various primary healthcare services; however, their potential for improving surgical care is under-explored. We sought to assess the role of CHWs in the surgical cascade, defined as disease screening, linkage to operative care, and post-operative care. Given the well-described literature on CHWs and screening, we focused on the latter two steps of the surgical cascade. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature. We searched for studies published in any language from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2020 using electronic literature databases including Pubmed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. We included articles on CHW involvement in linkage to operative care and/or post-operative surgical care. Narrative and descriptive methods were used to analyze the data. Results The initial search identified 145 articles relevant to steps in the surgical cascade. Ten studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for review. In linkage to care, CHWs helped increase surgical enrollment, provide resources for vulnerable patients, and build trust in healthcare services. Post-operatively, CHWs acted as effective monitors for surgical-site infections and provided socially isolated patients with support and linkage to additional services. The complex and wide-ranging needs of surgical patients illustrated the need to view surgical care as a continuum rather than a singular operative event. Conclusion While the current literature is limited, CHWs were able to maneuver complex medical, cultural, and social barriers to surgical care by linking patients to counseling, education, and community resources, as well as post-operative infection prevention services. Future studies would benefit from more rigorous study designs and larger sample sizes to further elucidate the role CHWs can serve in the surgical cascade.

AB  - Athletes and rehabilitation specialists have used Kinesio tape (KT) to help alleviate pain symptoms. Currently, no clear mechanism exists as to why pain is relieved with the use of KT and whether the pain relieving effect is simply a placebo effect. Additionally, the most effective taping parameters (tension of tape) for pain reduction remain unknown. We used quantitative sensory testing to address these key gaps in the KT and pain literature. Using a repeated-measures laboratory design, we examined whether KT applied at different tensions reduces experimentally-induced pain compared to a no tape condition and KT with minimal tension. Heat pain thresholds (HPT's), pressure pain thresholds (PPT's), and pressure pain suprathreshold (PPS: 125% of PPT) tests were administered to the forearm prior to and during KT and no tape conditions. Tape was applied to the ventral forearm at 25% of max tension, 75% of max tension, and no tension (placebo). Repeated measures ANOVA's evaluated the pain outcomes between conditions and across time. KT had no significant effect on PPT's and HPT's (p's >0.05). The ANOVA on PPS revealed that KT applied at 25% of tension significantly reduced pain ratings from the pretest (M = 34.4, SE = 5.5) to post-test 1 (M = 30.3, SE = 4.7) and post-test 2 (M = 30.4, SE = 4.7). No other conditions significantly reduced suprathreshold pressure pain. However, pain ratings at posttest-1 during the no-tape condition (M = 36.4, SE = 5.3) were significantly greater than pain ratings during post-test 1 and post-test 2 of all three tape conditions. In conclusion, the current study revealed that KT applied at low tension is the optimal tension to reduce pressure-evoked muscle pain. Additionally, the results suggested that KT applied at low, high, or no tension may acutely prevent increased muscle sensitivity with repeated pressure stimulation.

AB  - Generalist practitioners often find interacting with patients deeply satisfying and joyful; they also experience encounters that are challenging and complex. In both cases, they must be aware of the many issues that affect the processes and outcomes of patient care. Although using the BioPsychoSocial approach is an important, time-tested framework for cultivating one's awareness of patients' presenting concerns, recent developments suggest that additional frames of reference may enhance communication and relationships with patients. In this article, we describe several additions to the BioPsychoSocial approach, considerations we call "add-ons" and "add-ins". We invite generalist practitioners and, indeed, all health care practitioners, to consider how they can improve their ongoing care of patients by personalizing these and other additions in their day-to-day work with patients.

AB  - Evidence and clinical guidelines call care team members to address the spiritual well-being of pediatric patients, especially adolescents and young adults (AYA), with cancer and blood disorders. However, the lack of relevant training in generalist spiritual care has been a key barrier. Therefore, we aimed to improve clinicians' capabilities by utilizing the Interprofessional Spiritual Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC) to close this gap in pediatric hematology-oncology. A model of interprofessional spiritual care entails that all team members attend to patients' spirituality by employing generalist spiritual care skills and collaborating with spiritual care specialists such as chaplains.Interdisciplinary team members providing care for AYA with cancer and blood disorders were recruited to participate in interprofessional spiritual care education. Our intervention combined an evidence-based online curriculum and in-person discussion groups. Pretest-posttest study examined changes in participants' skills and practices to identify, address, and discuss spiritual concerns. Surveys were conducted at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention.Participants (n = 21) included physicians, advanced practice providers, nurse coordinators, and psychosocial team members. We observed positive changes in participants' ability (36%, P < 0.01), frequency (56%, P = 0.01), confidence (32%, P < 0.01), and comfort (31%, P = 0.02) providing generalist spiritual care baseline versus one month, with significant gains maintained through six months (Omnibus P < 0.05).Utilizing ISPEC, interprofessional spiritual care education has a strong potential to develop pediatric hematology-oncology team members' capabilities to attend to the spiritual aspect of whole-person care and thus contribute to the well-being of AYA with cancer and blood disorders.

AB  - Electronic health record (EHR) data are increasingly used to develop prediction models to support clinical care, including the care of patients with common chronic conditions. A key challenge for individual healthcare systems in developing such models is that they may not be able to achieve the desired degree of robustness using only their own data. A potential solution-combining data from multiple sources-faces barriers such as the need for data normalization and concerns about sharing patient information across institutions. To address these challenges, we evaluated three alternative approaches to using EHR data from multiple healthcare systems in predicting the outcome of pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM). Two of the three approaches, named Selecting Better (SB) and Weighted Average(WA), allowed the data to remain within institutional boundaries by using pre-built prediction models; the third, named Combining Data (CD), aggregated raw patient data into a single dataset. The prediction performance and prediction coverage of the resulting models were compared to single-institution models to help judge the relative value of adding external data and to determine the best method to generate optimal models for clinical decision support. The results showed that models using WA and CD achieved higher prediction performance than single-institution models for common treatment patterns. CD outperformed the other two approaches in prediction coverage, which we defined as the number of treatment patterns predicted with an Area Under Curve of 0.70 or more. We concluded that 1) WA is an effective option for improving prediction performance for common treatment patterns when data cannot be shared across institutional boundaries and 2) CD is the most effective approach when such sharing is possible, especially for increasing the range of treatment patterns that can be predicted to support clinical decision making.

AB  - Intrauterine devices are effective instruments for contraception, and 1 levonorgestrel-releasing device is also indicated for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).To compare the incidence of intrauterine device expulsion and uterine perforation in women with and without a diagnosis of menorrhagia within the first 12 months before device insertion STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in 3 integrated healthcare systems (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Southern California, and Washington) and a healthcare information exchange (Regenstrief Institute) in the United States using electronic health records. Nonpostpartum women aged ≤50 years with intrauterine device (eg, levonorgestrel or copper) insertions from 2001 to 2018 and without a delivery in the previous 12 months were studied in this analysis. Recent menorrhagia diagnosis (ie, recorded ≤12 months before insertion) was ascertained from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. The study outcomes, viz, device expulsion and device-related uterine perforation (complete or partial), were ascertained from electronic medical records and validated in the data sources. The cumulative incidence and crude incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the crude and adjusted hazard ratios using propensity score overlap weighting (13-16 variables) and 95% confidence intervals.Among 228,834 nonpostpartum women, the mean age was 33.1 years, 44.4% of them were White, and 31,600 (13.8%) had a recent menorrhagia diagnosis. Most women had a levonorgestrel-releasing device (96.4% of those with and 78.2% of those without a menorrhagia diagnosis). Women with a menorrhagia diagnosis were likely to be older, obese, and have dysmenorrhea or fibroids. Women with a menorrhagia diagnosis had a higher intrauterine device-expulsion rate (40.01 vs 10.92 per 1000 person-years) than those without, especially evident in the first few months after insertion. Women with a menorrhagia diagnosis had a higher cumulative incidence (95% confidence interval) of expulsion (7.00% [6.70-7.32] at 1 year and 12.03% [11.52-12.55] at 5 years) vs those without (1.77% [1.70-1.84] at 1 year and 3.69% [3.56-3.83] at 5 years). The risk of expulsion was increased for women with a menorrhagia diagnosis vs for those without (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.84 [95% confidence interval, 2.66-3.03]). The perforation rate was low overall (<1/1000 person-years) but higher in women with a diagnosis of menorrhagia vs in those without (0.98 vs 0.63 per 1000 person-years). The cumulative incidence (95% confidence interval) of uterine perforation was slightly higher for women with a menorrhagia diagnosis (0.09% [0.06-0.14] at 1 year and 0.39% [0.29-0.53] at 5 years) than those without it (0.07% [0.06-0.08] at 1 year and 0.28% [0.24-0.33] at 5 years). The risk of perforation was slightly increased in women with a menorrhagia diagnosis vs in those without (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.13).The risk of expulsion is significantly higher in women with a recent diagnosis of menorrhagia. Patient education and counseling regarding the potential expulsion risk is recommended at insertion. The absolute risk of perforation for women with a recent diagnosis of menorrhagia is very low. The increased expulsion and perforation rates observed are likely because of causal factors of menorrhagia.

AB  - The Genomic Medicine Working Group of the National Advisory Council for Human Genome Research virtually hosted its 13th genomic medicine meeting titled "Developing a Clinical Genomic Informatics Research Agenda". The meeting's goal was to articulate a research strategy to develop Genomics-based Clinical Informatics Tools and Resources (GCIT) to improve the detection, treatment, and reporting of genetic disorders in clinical settings.Experts from government agencies, the private sector, and academia in genomic medicine and clinical informatics were invited to address the meeting's goals. Invitees were also asked to complete a survey to assess important considerations needed to develop a genomic-based clinical informatics research strategy.Outcomes from the meeting included identifying short-term research needs, such as designing and implementing standards-based interfaces between laboratory information systems and electronic health records, as well as long-term projects, such as identifying and addressing barriers related to the establishment and implementation of genomic data exchange systems that, in turn, the research community could help address.Discussions centered on identifying gaps and barriers that impede the use of GCIT in genomic medicine. Emergent themes from the meeting included developing an implementation science framework, defining a value proposition for all stakeholders, fostering engagement with patients and partners to develop applications under patient control, promoting the use of relevant clinical workflows in research, and lowering related barriers to regulatory processes. Another key theme was recognizing pervasive biases in data and information systems, algorithms, access, value, and knowledge repositories and identifying ways to resolve them.

AB  - Background: High-risk patients undergoing elective surgery are at risk for perioperative complications, including readmissions and death. Advance care planning (ACP) may allow for preparation for such events. Objectives: (1) To assess the completion rate of advance directives (ADs) and their association with one year readmissions and mortality (2) to examine clinical events for decedents. Design: This is an observational cohort study conducted through chart review. Setting/Subjects: Subjects were 400 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for elective surgery at two hospitals in the United States. Measurements: The prevalence of ADs at the time of surgery and at one year, readmissions, and mortality at one year were determined. Results: Three-hundred ninety patients were included. In total, 102 (26.4%) patients were readmitted, yet did not complete an AD. Seventeen (4.4%) patients filed an AD during follow-up. Nineteen patients died and mortality rate was 4.9%. There was a significant association between completing an AD before death. Of the decedents, seven (37%) underwent resuscitation, but only four had ADs. Conclusions: Many high-risk surgical patients would benefit from ADs before clinical decline. Preoperative clinics present a missed opportunity to ensure ACP occurs before complications arise.

AB  - Dear Editor-In-Chief, We appreciate receiving the letter from Dr. Nuzzo (1). His letter is consistent with the purpose of our paper (2), one of which is communication—raising awareness of the issue and magnitude of health inequities and conveying the power of physical activity in promoting health equity. We believe that the best way to address and reduce disparities in health-promoting behaviors, disease, and disability outcomes is through a dialogue and open discussion about health disparities, equity, and social determinants of health. This exchange is an initial opportunity to engage in a dialogue among members of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) that we hope expands to a broader national dialogue in the United States and, if and where appropriate, in other countries as well. On the point that equity is political, we agree. We chose to use this term because it is in fact policies set by local, state, and government entities that shape physical activity opportunities at the population level. Where community parks are built and maintained is determined by local officials. Whether or not a school district mandates physical education and recess is set by state legislatures and boards of education. Access to quality healthcare where patients can participate in the Exercise Is Medicine® initiative (3) is currently being influenced by the federal government. Just as the U.S. government recognizes its role in shaping physical activity and health of the American public (e.g., 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans [4], Step it Up! The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable Communities [5], and Healthy People 2020 [6]), so does ACSM. We are calling for equitable opportunities to enable all Americans to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity. We disagree, however, on Dr. Nuzzo’s definition and operationalization of the term health equity. To define equity in terms of “good” and “bad” is an oversimplification of the issue. Moreover, how Dr. Nuzzo has described equity is a conflation of the terms equality (everyone receives the same resources) (7) and equity (when all people have “the opportunity to ‘attain their full health potential’ and no one is ‘disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of their social position or other socially determined circumstance’”) (8). Equity does not imply resources will be taken from one group and given to another but rather resources tailored to each community’s needs will be provided and community-specific barriers will be addressed. In the examples described by Dr. Nuzzo, those issues might be true when equality-based approaches are used to address disparities. That type of approach implies a reallocation of available resources, or provision of similar resources to everyone to increase physical activity, irrespective of baseline levels of physical activity. By contrast, equity-based approaches refer to providing different types of physical activity resources at multiple levels (individual, interpersonal, organizational, communities, and policies), at different time points across the life span (childhood, adolescence, midlife, and older adults) to increase and maintain physical activity participation in diverse communities. Using this approach, ACSM believes that achieving equity in physical activity participation is an attainable goal. Rebecca E.

AB  - Chronic pain is associated with profound negative effects, and racial disparities are well-documented in chronic pain treatment. In addition, Black patients report poorer communication with providers and exhibit lower levels of patient activation (self-management self-efficacy) than White patients. Although the causes of healthcare disparities are complex and require intervention at multiple levels, empowering patients is one critical path to achieving health equity. The current study is a coaching intervention focused on increasing patient activation and building communication skills for Black patients with chronic pain.In this randomized controlled trial, 250 Black patients with chronic pain were randomized to either the coaching intervention or an attention control arm. Intervention patients attended 6 telephone-delivered individual coaching sessions over 12 weeks. Coaching focused on clarifying and prioritizing goals and on communication skills, such as agenda setting. The primary outcome is patient activation. Secondary outcomes include communication self-efficacy, pain intensity and interference, and psychological functioning.Having the knowledge and confidence to participate in one's pain care, coupled with the skills needed to effectively communicate with providers, is essential to optimize chronic pain care. This is particularly important for Black patients who often experience lower quality pain care. Interventions such as COOPERATE hold promise for helping patients to acquire the requisite tools to take greater control of their chronic pain care.clinicaltrials.gov, # NCT03562793.

AB  - Patient-reported medical histories and medical consults are primary approaches to obtaining patients' medical histories in dental settings. While patient-reported medical histories are reported to have inconsistencies, sparse information exists regarding the completeness of medical providers' responses to dental providers' medical consults. This study examined records from a predoctoral dental student clinic to determine the reasons for medical consults; the medical information requested, the completeness of returned responses, and the time taken to receive answers for medical consult requests.A random sample of 240 medical consult requests for 179 distinct patients were selected from patient encounters between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017. Descriptive statistics and summaries were calculated to determine the reasons for the consult, the type of information requested and returned, and the time interval for each consult.The top two reasons for medical consults were to obtain more information (46.1%) and seek medical approval to proceed with treatment (30.3%). Laboratory and diagnostic reports (56.3%), recommendations/medical clearances (39.6%), medication information (38.3%), and current medical conditions (19.2%) were the frequent requests. However, medical providers responded fewer times to dental providers' laboratory and diagnostic report requests (41.3%), recommendations/medical clearances (19.2%), and current medical conditions (13.3%). While 86% of consults were returned in 30 days and 14% were completed after 30 days.The primary reasons for dental providers' medical consults are to obtain patient information and seek recommendations for dental care. Laboratory/diagnostic reports, current medical conditions, medication history, or modifications constituted the frequently requested information. Precautions for dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and contraindications included reasons to seek medical providers' recommendations. The results also highlight the challenges they experience, such as requiring multiple attempts to contact medical providers, the incompleteness of information shared, and the delays experienced in completing at least 25% of the consults.The study results call attention to the importance of interdisciplinary care to provide optimum dental care and the necessity to establish systems such as integrated electronic dental record-electronic health record systems and health information exchanges to improve information sharing and communication between dental and medical providers.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that community-wide mass drug administration (MDA) may interrupt the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), a group of intestinal worms that infect 1.5 billion individuals globally. Although current operational guidelines provide best practices for effective MDA delivery, they do not describe which activities are most essential for achieving high coverage or how they work together to produce effective intervention delivery. We aimed to identify the various packages of influential intervention delivery activities that result in high coverage of community-wide MDA for STH in Benin, India, and Malawi.We applied coincidence analysis (CNA), a novel cross-case analytical method, to process mapping data as part of the implementation science research of the DeWorm3 Project, a Hybrid Type 1 cluster randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of STH using bi-annual community-wide MDA in Benin, India, and Malawi. Our analysis aimed to identify any necessary and/or sufficient combinations of intervention delivery activities (i.e., implementation pathways) that resulted in high MDA coverage. Activities were related to drug supply chain, implementer training, community sensitization strategy, intervention duration, and implementation context. We used pooled implementation data from three sites and six intervention rounds, with study clusters serving as analytical cases (N = 360). Secondary analyses assessed differences in pathways across sites and over intervention rounds.Across all three sites and six intervention rounds, efficient duration of MDA delivery (within ten days) singularly emerged as a common and fundamental component for achieving high MDA coverage when combined with other particular activities, including a conducive implementation context, early arrival of albendazole before the planned start of MDA, or a flexible community sensitization strategy. No individual activity proved sufficient by itself for producing high MDA coverage. We observed four possible overall models that could explain effective MDA delivery strategies, all which included efficient duration of MDA delivery as an integral component.Efficient duration of MDA delivery uniquely stood out as a highly influential implementation activity for producing high coverage of community-wide MDA for STH. Effective MDA delivery can be achieved with flexible implementation strategies that include various combinations of influential intervention components.

AB  - Abstract Background Deprescribing interventions delivered through the electronic medical record have not significantly reduced the use of high‐risk anticholinergics in prior trials. Pharmacists have been identified as ideal practitioners to conduct deprescribing; however, little experience beyond collaborative consult models has been published. Objective To evaluate the impact of two pilot pharmacist‐based advanced practice models nested within primary care. Methods Pilot studies of a collaborative clinic‐based pharmacist deprescribing intervention and a telephone‐based pharmacist deprescribing intervention were conducted. Patients receiving the clinic‐based pharmacy model were aged 55 years and older and referred for deprescribing at a specialty clinic. Patients receiving the telephone‐based pharmacy model were aged 65 years and older and called by a clinical pharmacist for deprescribing without referral. Deprescribing was defined as a discontinuation or dose reduction reported either in clinical records or through self‐reporting. Results The 18 patients receiving clinic‐based deprescribing had a mean age of 68 years and 78% were female. Among 24 medications deemed eligible for deprescribing, 23 (96%) were deprescribed. The clinic‐based deprescribing model resulted in a 93% reduction in median annualized total standardized dose (TSD), 56% lowered their annualized exposure below a cognitive risk threshold, and 4 (17%) of medications were represcribed within 6 months. The 24 patients receiving telephone‐based deprescribing had a mean age of 73 years and 92% were female. Among 24 medications deemed eligible for deprescribing, 12 (50%) were deprescribed. There was no change in the median annualized TSD, the annualized TSD was lowered below a cognitive risk threshold in 46%, and no medications were represcribed within 6 months. Few withdrawal symptoms or adverse events were reported in both groups. Conclusions Pharmacist‐based deprescribing successfully reduced exposure to high‐risk anticholinergics in primary care older adults, yet further work is needed to understand the impact on clinical outcomes.

AB  - Topic Post–intensive care syndrome is a collection of symptoms that more than half of patients who survive a critical illness, and their family caregivers, experience after the illness. Those symptoms include weakness/ fatigue, sleep disturbances/insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, posttraumatic stress disorder, other mental health conditions, and a lack of effective coping strategies. Clinical Relevance To minimize the risk of a patient developing post–intensive care syndrome, intensive care unit nurses must adopt practices that reduce the severity of disability and optimize patient outcomes. They must also advocate for patients who need additional expert care. Purpose To describe interventions that critical care nurses can implement to minimize a patient’s risk for post–intensive care syndrome. Content Covered This article describes patients who have a high risk of developing post–intensive care syndrome and interventions that are within nurses’ purview.

AB  - Abstract Participant recruitment for research is a persistent bottleneck that can be improved by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs). Despite emerging evidence for various EHR-driven approaches, guidance for those attempting to select and use such approaches is limited. The national Recruitment Innovation Center established the EHR Recruitment Consult Resource (ERCR) service line to support multisite studies through implementation of EHR-driven recruitment strategies. As the ERCR, we evolved a guide through 17 consultations over 3 years with multisite studies recruiting in diverse biomedical research domains. We assessed literature and engaged domain experts to identify five key EHR-driven recruitment strategies: direct to patient messages, candidate lists for mailings/calls, direct to research alerts, point of care alerts, and participant registries. Differentiating factors were grouped into factors of study population, study protocol and recruitment workflows, and recruitment site capabilities. The decision matrix indicates acceptable or preferred strategies based on the differentiating factors. Across the ERCR consultations, candidate lists for mailing or calls were most common, participant registries were least frequently recommended, and for some studies no EHR-driven recruitment was recommended. Comparative effectiveness research is needed to refine further evidence for these and potentially new strategies to come.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The learning health system (LHS) aligns science, informatics, incentives, stakeholders, and culture for continuous improvement and innovation. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute designed a K12 initiative to grow the number of LHS scientists. We describe approaches developed by 11 funded centers of excellence (COEs) to promote partnerships between scholars and health system leaders and to provide mentored research training. Methods Since 2018, the COEs have enlisted faculty, secured institutional resources, partnered with health systems, developed and implemented curricula, recruited scholars, and provided mentored training. Program directors for each COE provided descriptive data on program context, scholar characteristics, stakeholder engagement, scholar experiences with health system partnerships, roles following program completion, and key training challenges. Results To date, the 11 COEs have partnered with health systems to train 110 scholars. Nine (82%) programs partner with a Veterans Affairs health system and 9 (82%) partner with safety net providers. Clinically trained scholars (n = 87; 79%) include 70 physicians and 17 scholars in other clinical disciplines. Non‐clinicians (n = 29; 26%) represent diverse fields, dominated by population health sciences. Stakeholder engagement helps scholars understand health system and patient/family needs and priorities, enabling opportunities to conduct embedded research, improve outcomes, and grow skills in translating research methods and findings into practice. Challenges include supporting scholars through roadblocks that threaten to derail projects during their limited program time, ranging from delays in access to data to COVID‐19‐related impediments and shifts in organizational priorities. Conclusions Four years into this novel training program, there is evidence of scholars' accomplishments, both in traditional academic terms and in terms of moving along career trajectories that hold the potential to lead and accelerate transformational health system change. Future LHS training efforts should focus on sustainability, including organizational support for scholar activities.

AB  - Novel buprenorphine dosing strategies have emerged with an aim to transition patients from opioid agonists to buprenorphine without prerequisite opioid withdrawal. We applied a configurational approach to a subset of data from our earlier systematic review to answer the following question: when patients received a buprenorphine initiation strategy aimed to eliminate prerequisite withdrawal, what factors consistently distinguished patients that experienced withdrawal during the initiation process from patients that did not?From the 24 cases identified by our systematic review, we included cases that were treated using buprenorphine microdosing strategies (oral or transdermal), cases with opioid use disorder, and cases that fully transitioned to buprenorphine without continuing the full opioid agonist. Configurational analysis was used to identify combinations of patient and regimen level factors that uniquely distinguished cases experiencing withdrawal during induction.Fourteen cases were included in our analysis, of which 9 experienced opioid withdrawal symptoms. Three factors were involved in explaining both the presence and absence of withdrawal symptoms: history of heroin use, history of methadone use, and duration of overlap between buprenorphine and the full opioid agonist during induction. For the presence of withdrawal symptoms, the addition of a fourth factor "buprenorphine starting dose" resulted in a model with perfect consistency and coverage; for the absence of withdrawal symptoms, the addition of a fourth factor "induction duration" similarly resulted in a model with perfect consistency and 80% coverage.Application of configurational methods allowed synthesis of case reports identified through a systematic review.

AB  - Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in a primary care setting is challenging due to time constraints and stigma. The implementation of scalable, sustainable, and patient-driven processes may improve early detection of ADRD; however, there are competing approaches; information may be obtained either directly from a patient (e.g., through a questionnaire) or passively using electronic health record (EHR) data. In this study, we aim to identify the benefit of a combined approach using a pragmatic cluster-randomized clinical trial.We have developed a Passive Digital Marker (PDM), based on machine learning algorithms applied to EHR data, and paired it with a patient-reported outcome (the Quick Dementia Rating Scale or QDRS) to rapidly share an identified risk of impairment to a patient's physician. Clinics in both south Florida and Indiana will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: 1200 patients in each of the two populations will be administered either the PDM, the PDM with the QDRS, or neither, for a total of 7200 patients across all clinics and populations. Both incidence of ADRD diagnosis and acceptance into ADRD diagnostic work-up regimens is hypothesized to increase when patients are administered both the PDM and QDRS. Physicians performing the work-up regimens will be blind to the study arm of the patient.This study aims to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the two scalable approaches (PDM and QDRS) for the early detection of ADRD among older adults attending primary care practices. The data obtained in this study may lead to national early detection and management program for ADRD as an efficient and beneficial method of reducing the current and future burden of ADRD, as well as improving the annual rate of newly documented ADRD in primary care practices.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05231954 .

AB  - Dear Editor, Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is the most common of the 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [1]. Among its primary features are joint hypermobility, fatigue, and chronic pain. There is still no known genotype associated with hEDS, meaning that clinicians must rely on a rigid set of clinical criteria to make an accurate diagnosis [2]. These criteria include self-reported chronic pain, which makes the assessment of pain central not only to the experience of hEDS but also to its diagnosis. However, the elicitation of pain scores is irreducibly subjective and private. Thus, an understanding of the beliefs and practices of patients in quantifying their pain is essential to the successful management of hEDS and other conditions characterized by chronic pain. The 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) is the instrument most commonly used to determine patients’ perceptions of their pain. Clinicians ask patients to rate their pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain imaginable). On the basis of this self-report and a physical examination, clinicians take actions to moderate patients’ pain. The NRS is also subsequently used to evaluate the success of those pain management techniques in follow-up appointments.

AB  - Objectives. To assess the effectiveness of vaccine-induced immunity against new infections, all-cause emergency department (ED) and hospital visits, and mortality in Indiana. Methods. Combining statewide testing and immunization data with patient medical records, we matched individuals who received at least 1 dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines with individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on index date, age, gender, race/ethnicity, zip code, and clinical diagnoses. We compared the cumulative incidence of infection, all-cause ED visits, hospitalizations, and mortality. Results. We matched 267 847 pairs of individuals. Six months after the index date, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly higher in vaccine recipients (6.7%) than the previously infected (2.9%). All-cause mortality in the vaccinated, however, was 37% lower than that of the previously infected. The rates of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations were 24% and 37% lower in the vaccinated than in the previously infected. Conclusions. The significantly lower rates of all-cause ED visits, hospitalizations, and mortality in the vaccinated highlight the real-world benefits of vaccination. The data raise questions about the wisdom of reliance on natural immunity when safe and effective vaccines are available.

AB  - Measures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine diagnosis and care for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of the pandemic on breast cancer care in a statewide cohort.Using data from a large health information exchange, we retrospectively analyzed the timing of breast cancer screening, and identified a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with any stage of breast cancer to further access the information available about their surgical treatments. We compared data for four subgroups: pre-lockdown (preLD) 25 March to 16 June 2019; lockdown (LD) 23 March to 3 May 2020; reopening (RO) 4 May to 14 June 2020; and post-lockdown (postLD) 22 March to 13 June 2021.During LD and RO, screening mammograms in the cohort decreased by 96.3% and 36.2%, respectively. The overall breast cancer diagnosis and surgery volumes decreased up to 38.7%, and the median time to surgery was prolonged from 1.5 months to 2.4 for LD and 1.8 months for RO. Interestingly, higher mean DCIS diagnosis (5.0 per week vs. 3.1 per week, p < 0.05) and surgery volume (14.8 vs. 10.5, p < 0.05) were found for postLD compared with preLD, while median time to surgery was shorter (1.2 months vs. 1.5 months, p < 0.0001). However, the postLD average weekly screening and diagnostic mammogram did not fully recover to preLD levels (2055.3 vs. 2326.2, p < 0.05; 574.2 vs. 624.1, p < 0.05).Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment patterns were interrupted during the lockdown and still altered 1 year after. Screening in primary care should be expanded to mitigate possible longer-term effects of these interruptions.

AB  - Impact of geriatric consultative services (GCS) on hospital readmission and mortality outcomes for cognitively impaired (CI) patients is not known.Evaluate impact of GCS on hospital readmission and mortality among CI inpatients.Secondary data analysis of a prospective trial of a computerized decision support system between July 1, 2006 and May 30, 2008.Study conducted at Eskenazi hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana, a 340-bed, public hospital with over 2300 yearly admissions of patients ages 65 years or older.There were 415 inpatients aged 65 years and older with CI enrolled from July 2006 to March 2008.Thirty-day and 1-year mortality and hospital readmission following the index admission. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between receiving GCS, readmission, or mortality while adjusting for demographics, discharge destination, delirium, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and prior hospitalizations. The propensity score method was used to adjust for the nonrandom assignment of GCS.Patients receiving GCS were older (79 years old, 8.1 standard deviation [SD] vs 76 years old, 7.8 SD; P < 0.001) with higher incidence of delirium (49% vs 29%; P < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups for hospital readmission (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 0.89-1.59) and mortality at 12 months of index admission (HR = 0.91; 95% confidence interval = 0.59-1.40). However, a significant increase in readmissions was observed for the GCS group (HR = 1.75; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-2.88) at 30 days postdischarge.One-year postdischarge outcomes of CI patients who received GCS were not different from patients who did not receive the service. New models of care are needed to improve postdischarge readmission and mortality among hospitalized patients with CI.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex human diseases, clinical conditions and traits. Genetic mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is providing us with novel functional effects of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In a classical quantitative trail loci (QTL) mapping problem multiple tests are done to assess whether one trait is associated with a number of loci. In contrast to QTL studies, thousands of traits are measured alongwith thousands of gene expressions in an eQTL study. For such a study, a huge number of tests have to be performed (~10(6)). This extreme multiplicity gives rise to many computational and statistical problems. In this paper we have tried to address these issues using two closely related inferential approaches: an empirical Bayes method that bears the Bayesian flavor without having much a priori knowledge and the frequentist method of false discovery rates. A three-component t-mixture model has been used for the parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) method. Inferences have been obtained using Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm. A simulation study has also been performed and has been compared with a nonparametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) alternative.The results show that PEB has an edge over NPEB. The proposed methodology has been applied to human liver cohort (LHC) data. Our method enables to discover more significant SNPs with FDR<10% compared to the previous study done by Yang et al. (Genome Research, 2010).In contrast to previously available methods based on p-values, the empirical Bayes method uses local false discovery rate (lfdr) as the threshold. This method controls false positive rate.

AB  - Rates of anti-reflux procedures (ARP) vary greatly among pediatric hospitals. How pediatric subspecialists make referral decisions for ARPs has not been described. The aim of this study was to characterize pediatric subspecialists' decision making for referring children for ARPs.Pediatric subspecialists at a single children's hospital were interviewed about their decision making when referring for ARPs. Qualitative analysis was performed on clinicians' perceptions of the risks and benefits of the treatment options. Clinical algorithms were derived from each interview and were compared using the Clinical Algorithm Nosology. Clinical Algorithm Structural Analysis (CASA) scores were calculated to assess algorithm complexity. Clinical Algorithm Patient Abstraction (CAPA) scores on a scale from 0 (different) to 10 (identical) were generated based on algorithm agreement.The interviews yielded 15 algorithms. There was substantial variation in the providers' perceived risks and benefits of the treatment options. CASA scores ranged from 8 to 28 and CAPA scores ranged from 0 to 5.7 (median, 0), indicating great variation in both complexity and patient management. Management variation included testing (33% of algorithms incorporated pH probe test, 67% upper gastrointestinal, and 47% small bowel follow-through), procedure contraindications (33% considered history of gagging a contraindication to ARP), and use of gastrojejunostomy tubes (20% using gastrojejunostomy tube before ARP).No standards exist for the decision to refer children with gastroesophageal reflux disease for ARP. There is great variation among pediatric subspecialists in their decision making. Differences in providers' perception of the risks and benefits of these procedures contribute to this variation.

AB  - To develop a map of disease associations exclusively using two publicly available genetic sources: the catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the HapMap, and the catalog of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) from the NHGRI, and to evaluate it with a large, long-standing electronic medical record (EMR).A computational model, In Silico Bayesian Integration of GWAS (IsBIG), was developed to learn associations among diseases using a Bayesian network (BN) framework, using only genetic data. The IsBIG model (I-Model) was re-trained using data from our EMR (M-Model). Separately, another clinical model (C-Model) was learned from this training dataset. The I-Model was compared with both the M-Model and the C-Model for power to discriminate a disease given other diseases using a test dataset from our EMR. Area under receiver operator characteristics curve was used as a performance measure. Direct associations between diseases in the I-Model were also searched in the PubMed database and in classes of the Human Disease Network (HDN).On the basis of genetic information alone, the I-Model linked a third of diseases from our EMR. When compared to the M-Model, the I-Model predicted diseases given other diseases with 94% specificity, 33% sensitivity, and 80% positive predictive value. The I-Model contained 117 direct associations between diseases. Of those associations, 20 (17%) were absent from the searches of the PubMed database; one of these was present in the C-Model. Of the direct associations in the I-Model, 7 (35%) were absent from disease classes of HDN.Using only publicly available genetic sources we have mapped associations in GWAS to a human disease map using an in silico approach. Furthermore, we have validated this disease map using phenotypic data from our EMR. Models predicting disease associations on the basis of known genetic associations alone are specific but not sensitive. Genetic data, as it currently exists, can only explain a fraction of the risk of a disease. Our approach makes a quantitative statement about disease variation that can be explained in an EMR on the basis of genetic associations described in the GWAS.

AB  - This document describes a research protocol for a study designed to estimate the impact of implementing a reminder system for medical providers on the use of isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) for adults living with HIV in western Kenya. People living with HIV have a 5% to 10% annual risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) once infected with TB bacilli, compared to a 5% lifetime risk in HIV-negative people with latent TB infection. Moreover, people living with HIV have a 20-fold higher risk of dying from TB. A growing body of literature suggests that IPT reduces overall TB incidence and is therefore of considerable benefit to patients and the larger community. However, in 2009, of the estimated 33 million people living with HIV, only 1.7 million (5%) were screened for TB, and about 85,000 (0.2%) were offered IPT. This study will examine the use of clinical decision-support reminders to improve rates of initiation of preventative treatment in a TB/HIV co-morbid population living in a TB endemic area. This will be a pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster-randomized superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation to treatment ratio. For the trial, 20 public medical facilities that use clinical summary sheets generated from an electronic medical records system will participate as clusters. All HIV-positive adult patients who complete an initial encounter at a study cluster and at least one return encounter during the study period will be included in the study cohort. The primary endpoint will be IPT prescription at 3 months post the initial encounter. We will conduct both individual-level and cluster-level analyses. Due to the nature of the intervention, the trial will not be blinded. This study will contribute to the growing evidence base for the use of electronic health interventions in low-resource settings to promote high-quality clinical care, health system optimization and positive patient outcomes.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined based on exposure to actual or threatened death, injury, or violence and the presence for ≥30 days postevent of intrusive symptoms (eg, flashbacks), persistent avoidance of stimuli, negative alteration in mood and cognition, and marked alteration in arousal and reactivity (eg, hypervigilance).1 Although diagnostically distinct, PTSD symptoms overlap with symptoms of depression and anxiety, making it complex to evaluate the unique associations between these different conditions and their contribution to disease trajectory or outcome. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, depression and anxiety have been much more frequently investigated than PTSD, with prevalence estimates for these conditions typically ranging from 20% to 30% in the poststroke period,2–4 leading to recommendations to screen all stroke patients for depression in the early poststroke period.5 A sprinkling of studies of mixed …

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be a complication in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD). Although the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil shows evidence of efficacy and tolerability among patients with PAH associated with CTD in clinical trials, no studies have examined the association between its use and health care resource utilization in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to assess the associations between the use of sildenafil and health care resource utilization, specifically days of hospitalization, in a population with PAH associated with CTD.A retrospective, matched, case-control analysis was conducted using data from a commercial claims database. Patients with a claim dated between 2003 and 2009 were selected. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, and baseline total days of hospitalization. A longitudinal, zero-inflated, negative binomial model was used for analyzing the data after control for age, sex, region, Charlson comorbidity score, and use of PAH-specific medication other than sildenafil.A total of 420 individuals, 210 cases and 210 controls, were included in the sample. The sample was 85.71% women, and the mean age was 57.6 years. Estimates for variances of an intercept random effect (5.08 × 10(-13)) and for a time-variable random effect (2.84 × 10(-16)) were both essentially zero. Thus a zero-inflated negative binomial model without random effects was used. When individuals were not using sildenafil, each 1-month interval was associated with a 2.8% increase in the mean number of days of hospitalization. In contrast, when individuals were using sildenafil, each 1-month interval was associated with a decrease of 3.3% in days of hospitalization.In this data analysis of the association between sildenafil use and days of hospitalization among individuals with PAH associated with CTD in a large-scale population, sildenafil use in the treatment of PAH associated with CTD was associated with reduced days of hospitalization during the year after the initiation of treatment.

AB  - Risk-adjusted poststroke mortality has been proposed for use as a measure of stroke care quality. Although valid measures of stroke severity (e.g., the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) are not typically available in administrative datasets, radiology reports are often available within electronic health records. We sought to examine whether admission head computed tomography data could be used to estimate stroke severity.Using chart review data from a cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients (1998-2003), we developed a radiographic measure ([BIS]) of stroke severity in a two-third development set and assessed in a one-third validation set. The retrospective NIHSS was dichotomized as mild/moderate (<10) and severe (≥10). We compared the association of this radiographic score with NIHSS and in-hospital mortality at the patient level.Among 1348 stroke patients, 86.5% had abnormal findings on initial head computed tomography. The c-statistic for the BIS for modeling severe stroke (development, .581; validation, .579) and in-hospital mortality (development, .623; validation, .678) were generated.Although the c-statistics were only moderate, the BIS provided significant risk stratification information with a 2-variable score. Until administrative data routinely includes a valid measure of stroke severity, radiographic data may provide information for use in risk adjustment.

AB  - Chronic pain is a prevalent chronic condition with significant burden and economic impact in the United States. Chronic pain is particularly abundant in primary care, with an estimated 52% of chronic pain patients obtaining care from primary care physicians (PCPs). However, PCPs often lack adequate training and have limited time and resources to effectively manage chronic pain. Chronic pain management is complex in nature because of high co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders and other medical comorbidities in patients. This article describes a quality improvement initiative conducted by the American College of Physicians (ACP), in collaboration with the Kentucky ACP Chapter, and the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, to enhance chronic pain management in 8 primary care practices participating in Accountable Care Organizations in Kentucky, with a goal of enhancing the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with chronic pain.

The dysphagia-screening tool was redesigned on the basis of frontline clinician feedback, clinical guidelines, user satisfaction, and multidisciplinary expertise. The revised tool triggered a speech-language consult for positive screens and demonstrated higher scores in user satisfaction and task efficiency. Systems redesign processes were effective for redesigning the tool and implementing practice changes with clinicians involved in dysphagia screening.

AB  - Patients who have total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation. The aim of the study was to examine pharmacologic prophylaxis against VTE among patients with THR or TKR and to assess demographic and clinical correlates related to VTE prophylaxis. Using 15 years of data (1995-2009) from an electronic medical record system for an inner-city public hospital in the United States, we examined pharmacologic prophylaxis against VTE and associated factors in patients after THR (n = 242) and TKR (n = 317). Before the early 2000s, aspirin was the most common prophylaxis agent (THR, 61% and TKR, 65%), and 26% of patients with THR and 19% of patients with TKR did not receive prophylaxis. Enoxaparin use has increased since 2000, and warfarin is now the most common prophylaxis agent (THR, 70% and TKR, 61%). After controlling for time period, factors associated with prophylaxis pattern included obesity, hip fracture, and the surgeon's number of years in practice. VTE prophylaxis medications in patients with total joint replacement have changed over 15 years, in trends generally consistent with the evolution of guidelines. Obesity, history of hip fracture, and physician's experience are associated with the prescription of VTE prophylaxis medications.

AB  - FDA-approved prescribing information (also known as product labeling or labels) contain critical safety information for health care professionals. Drug labels have often been criticized, however, for being overly complex, difficult to read, and rife with overwarning, leading to high cognitive load. In this project, we aimed to improve the usability of drug labels by increasing the 'signal-to-noise ratio' and providing meaningful information to care providers based on patient-specific comorbidities and concomitant medications. In the current paper, we describe the design process and resulting web application, known as myDrugLabel. Using the Structured Product Label documents as a base, we describe the process of label personalization, readability improvements, and integration of diverse evidence sources, including the medical literature from PubMed, pharmacovigilance reports from FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS), and social media signals directly into the label.

AB  - Comments on the article by Kotay, Huang, Jordan, and Korin (see record 2016-22430-001). They tackle how to document patients' social histories in a way that is useful in real-time clinical practice-and explore the implementation of a new electronic health record (EHR) template specifically built to support their residency practice's commitment to addressing the social dimensions of patients' lives. For all of us convinced that the simultaneous integration of the biological, social, psychological, and existential dimensions of care is key to the practice of primary care, there are many questions to explore in relation to using EHRs. How are we going to do this in an environment that preferentially supports particularized data over an engaged awareness of context? How are we going to convince those with the technological expertise and administrative power that the transmission of information alone is not a substitute for insight, meaning, and relationships (Ventres & Frankel, 2010)? And ultimately, how are we going to make sure the EHR works for us instead of against us? Kotay and her colleagues have not answered all these questions in their study-such a task is beyond the abilities of one person or group of researchers- but along with others they have begun to illuminate a way forward (Cifuentes et al., 2015; Glowa-Kollisch et al., 2014). May we all now strive to continue the work that these authors have started. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Objective: We examined associations between observed neighborhood conditions (good/adverse) and psychosocial outcomes (stress, depressive symptoms, resilience, and sense of control) among middle-aged and older African Americans. Methods: The sample included 455 middle-aged and older African Americans examined in Wave 10 of the African American Health (AAH) study. Linear regression was adjusted for attrition, self-selection into neighborhoods, and potential confounders, and stratified by the duration at current address (&lt;5 vs ≥5 years) because of its hypothesized role as an effect modifier. Results: Among individuals who lived at their current address for ≥5 years, residing in neighborhoods with adverse versus good conditions was associated with significantly less stress (standardized β = −0.18; P = .002) and depressive symptoms (standardized β = −0.12; P = .048). Among those who lived at their current address for &lt;5 years, residing in neighborhoods with adverse versus good conditions was not significantly associated with stress (standardized β = 0.18; P = .305) or depressive symptoms (standardized β = 0.36; P = .080). Conclusion: Neighborhood conditions appear to have significant, complex associations with psychosocial factors among middle-aged and older African Americans. This holds important policy implications, especially since adverse neighborhood conditions may still result in adverse physical health outcomes in individuals with &gt;5 years at current residence despite being associated with better psychosocial outcomes.

There were 701 older adults with normal weight, 1,081 with overweight, and 902 with obesity (mean age 73.6) randomized to memory training, reasoning training, speed of processing training, or no-training control group. Participants completed memory, reasoning, and speed of processing tests. Baseline sociodemographic, health, and chronic disease measures were included as covariates in analyses.The 10-year trajectories of memory, reasoning, or speed of processing performance did not differ by BMI status among the participants randomized to the untrained control arm. The training effect on the reasoning and speed of processing outcomes did not differ by BMI status. The training effect on the memory outcome in participants with a BMI indicating obesity, however, was just 38% of that observed in participants with normal-weight BMI.These analyses of data from the largest trial of cognitive training ever conducted suggest that older adults with obesity may be less responsive to memory training.

AB  - A health information exchange (HIE)-based prior computed tomography (CT) alerting system may reduce avoidable CT imaging by notifying ordering clinicians of prior relevant studies when a study is ordered. For maximal effectiveness, a system would alert not only for prior same CTs (exams mapped to the same code from an exam name terminology) but also for similar CTs (exams mapped to different exam name terminology codes but in the same anatomic region) and anatomically proximate CTs (exams in adjacent anatomic regions). Notification of previous same studies across an HIE requires mapping of local site CT codes to a standard terminology for exam names (such as Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINC]) to show that two studies with different local codes and descriptions are equivalent. Notifying of prior similar or proximate CTs requires an additional mapping of exam codes to anatomic regions, ideally coded by an anatomic terminology. Several anatomic terminologies exist, but no prior studies have evaluated how well they would support an alerting use case.The aim of this study was to evaluate the fitness of five existing standard anatomic terminologies to support similar or proximate alerts of an HIE-based prior CT alerting system.We compared five standard anatomic terminologies (Foundational Model of Anatomy, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms, RadLex, LOINC, and LOINC/Radiological Society of North America [RSNA] Radiology Playbook) to an anatomic framework created specifically for our use case (Simple ANatomic Ontology for Proximity or Similarity [SANOPS]), to determine whether the existing terminologies could support our use case without modification. On the basis of an assessment of optimal terminology features for our purpose, we developed an ordinal anatomic terminology utility classification. We mapped samples of 100 random and the 100 most frequent LOINC CT codes to anatomic regions in each terminology, assigned utility classes for each mapping, and statistically compared each terminology's utility class rankings. We also constructed seven hypothetical alerting scenarios to illustrate the terminologies' differences.Both RadLex and the LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook anatomic terminologies ranked significantly better (P<.001) than the other standard terminologies for the 100 most frequent CTs, but no terminology ranked significantly better than any other for 100 random CTs. Hypothetical scenarios illustrated instances where no standard terminology would support appropriate proximate or similar alerts, without modification.LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook and RadLex's anatomic terminologies appear well suited to support proximate or similar alerts for commonly ordered CTs, but for less commonly ordered tests, modification of the existing terminologies with concepts and relations from SANOPS would likely be required. Our findings suggest SANOPS may serve as a framework for enhancing anatomic terminologies in support of other similar use cases.

AB  - Recent focus on Precision medicine (PM) has led to a flurry of research activities across the developed world. But how can understaffed and underfunded health care systems in the US and elsewhere evolve to adapt PM to address pressing healthcare needs? We offer guidance on a wide range of sources of healthcare data / knowledge as well as other infrastructure / tools that could inform PM initiatives, and may serve as low hanging fruit easily adapted on the incremental pathway towards a PM based healthcare system. Using these resources and tools, we propose an incremental adoption pathway to inform implementers working in underserved communities around the world on how they should position themselves to gradually embrace the concepts of PM with minimal interruption to existing care delivery.

AB  - American Heart Association/American Stroke Association expert consensus guidelines recommend consideration of cardiac stress testing to screen for occult coronary heart disease (CHD) among patients with ischemic stroke/TIA who have a high-risk Framingham Cardiac Risk Score (FCRS). Whether this guideline is being implemented in routine clinical practice, and the association of its implementation with mortality, is less clear.Study participants were Veterans with stroke/TIA (n = 11,306) during fiscal year 2011 who presented to a VA Emergency Department or who were admitted. Patients were excluded (n = 6,915) based on prior CHD/angina/chest pain history, receipt of cardiac stress testing within 18 months prior to cerebrovascular event, death within 90 days of discharge, discharge to hospice, transfer to a non-VA acute care facility, or missing/unknown race. FCRS ≥20% was classified as high risk for CHD. ICD-9 and Common Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify receipt of any cardiac stress testing.Among 4,391 eligible patients, 62.8% (n = 2,759) had FCRS ≥20%. Cardiac stress testing was performed infrequently and in similar proportion among high-risk (4.5% [123/2,759]) vs low/intermediate-risk (4.4% [72/1,632]) patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-1.10). Receipt of stress testing was not associated with reduced 1-year mortality (aOR 0.59, CI 0.26-1.30).In this observational cohort study of patients with cerebrovascular disease, cardiac screening was relatively uncommon and was not associated with 1-year mortality. Additional work is needed to understand the utility of CHD screening among high-risk patients with cerebrovascular disease.

AB  - Red blood cells (RBC) undergo morphologic and biochemical changes during storage which may lead to adverse health risks upon transfusion. In prior studies, the effect of RBC age on health outcomes has been conflicting. We designed the study to assess the effects of RBC units' storage duration on health outcomes specifically for hospitalized patients undergoing hip fracture surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.Using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes, hip fracture surgery and CABG surgery patients, who received RBC transfusions between 2008 and 2013, were retrospectively identified from the electronic medical records system. Hip fracture surgery and CABG cohorts were sub-divided into 3 blood age groups based upon RBC unit age at the time of transfusion: young blood (RBC units stored less than or equal to 14 days), old blood (RBC units were stored for greater than or equal to 28 days), or mixed blood for the remaining patients. Outcome variables were 30-day, 90-day, and inpatient mortality as well as hospital length of stay.A total of 3,182 patients were identified: 1,121 with hip fractures and 2,061 with CABG. Transfusion of old blood was associated with higher inpatient mortality in the hip fracture surgery cohort (OR 166.8, 95% CI 1.067-26064.7, p = 0.04) and a higher 30-day mortality in the CABG cohort (OR 4.55, 95% CI 1.01-20.49, p = 0.03).Transfusing RBC units stored for greater than or equal to 28 days may be associated with a higher mortality for patients undergoing hip fracture or CABG.

AB  - Among cancer patients, prior antidepressant use has been associated with impaired survival. This could be due to differences in stage at diagnosis, in receipt of treatment, or in treatment complications. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to examine if preadmission antidepressant use in patients with bladder cancer is associated with tumor stage at diagnosis, rate of cystectomy, and surgical outcomes, including survival. We performed a registry-based cohort study including all patients with incident invasive bladder cancer in Denmark 2005–2015. Exposure was defined as redemption of two or more antidepressant prescriptions one year before cancer diagnosis. We compared tumor stage using logistic regression, postsurgical inpatient length of stay using linear regression, and other outcomes using Cox regression. All results were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, and marital status. Among 10,427 bladder cancer patients, 10% were antidepressant users. At diagnosis, 51% of users and 52% of non-users had muscle-invasive disease. However, upon adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, and marital status, users had lower odds of muscle-invasive disease (adjusted odds ratio 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.99)). Among patients with muscle-invasive disease, fewer users than non-users had surgery within three months (15% vs. 24%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.75 (95% CI 0.59–0.95)). Of 2532 patients undergoing surgery, 6% were antidepressant users. Postsurgical inpatient length of stay did not differ between users and non-users. The 30-day cumulative incidence of readmission was higher for users (41% vs. 33%, aHR 1.33 (95% CI 1.05–1.67)), while the 90-day incidence of postoperative procedures was 44% for users and 38% for non-users (aHR 1.18 (95% CI 0.93–1.51)). One-year mortality was comparable in users (15%) and non-users (14%). Antidepressant use in bladder cancer patients was associated with less advanced stage at diagnosis and lower rate of cystectomy. After cystectomy, users had higher rate of readmission and postoperative procedures than non-users, but we found no difference in length of stay or one-year mortality. The results point to the importance of differentiated clinical care according to individual patient characteristics.

AB  - Rapid response teams (RRTs) improve mortality by intervening in the hours preceding arrest. Implementation of these teams varies across institutions.Our health-care system has two different RRT models at two hospitals: Hospital A does not utilize a proactive rounder while Hospital B does. We studied the patterns of RRT calls at each hospital focusing on the differences between night and day and during nursing shift transitions.The presence of proactive surveillance appeared to be associated with an increased total number of RRT calls with more than twice as many calls made at the smaller Hospital B than Hospital A. Hospital B had more calls in the daytime compared to the nighttime. Both hospitals showed a surge in the night-to-day shift transition (7-8am) compared to the preceding nighttime. Hospital A additionally showed a surge in calls during the day-to-night shift transition (7-8pm) compared to the preceding daytime.Differences in the diurnal patterns of RRT activation exist between hospitals even within the same system. As a continuously learning system, each hospital should consider tracking these patterns to identify their unique vulnerabilities. More calls are noted between 7-8am compared to the overnight hours. This may represent the reestablishment of the 'afferent' arm of the RRT as the hospital returns to daytime staffing and activity. Factors that influence the impact of proactive rounding on RRT performance may deserve further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Describe the implementation and effects of Mobile Acute Care for Elders (MACE) consultation at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). DESIGN Retrospective cohort analysis. INTERVENTION Veterans aged 65 or older who were admitted to the medicine service between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2014, were screened for geriatric syndromes via review of medical records within 48 hours of admission. If the screen was positive, the MACE team offered the admitting team a same‐day consultation involving comprehensive geriatric assessment and ongoing collaboration with the admitting team and supportive services to implement patient‐centric recommendations for geriatric syndromes. RESULTS Veterans seen by MACE (n = 421) were compared with those with positive screens but without consultation (n = 372). The two groups did not significantly differ in age, comorbidity, sex, or race. All outcomes (30‐day readmission, 30‐day mortality, readmission costs) were in the expected direction for patients receiving MACE but did not reach statistical significance. Patients receiving MACE had lower odds of 30‐day readmission (11.9% vs 14.8%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54‐1.25; p = .360) and 30‐day mortality (5.5% vs 8.6%; OR = 0.64; CI = 0.36‐1.12; p = .115), and they had lower 30‐day readmission costs (MACE $15,502; CI = $12,242‐$19,631; comparison = $18,335; CI = $14,641‐$22,962; p = .316) than those who did not receive MACE after adjusting for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION Our MACE consultation model for older veterans with geriatric syndromes leverages the limited supply of clinicians with expertise in geriatrics. Although not statistically significant in this study of 793 subjects, MACE patients had lower odds of 30‐day readmission and mortality, and lower readmission costs.

AB  - Community health coalitions (CHCs) are a promising approach for addressing disparities in rural health statistics. However, their effectiveness has been variable, and evaluation methods have been insufficient and inconsistent. Thus, we propose a mixed-methods evaluation framework and discuss pilot study findings. CHCs in our pilot study partnered with Purdue Extension. Extension links communities and land grant universities, providing programming and support for community-engaged research. We conducted social network analysis and effectiveness perception surveys in CHCs in 8 rural Indiana counties during summer 2017 and accessed county-level health statistics from 2015-16. We compared calculated variables (i.e., effectiveness survey k-means clusters, network measures, health status/outcomes) using Pearson's correlations. CHC members' positive perceptions of their leadership and functioning correlated with interconnectedness in their partnership networks, while more centralized partnership networks correlated with CHC members reporting problems in their coalitions. CHCs with highly rated leadership and functioning developed in counties with poor infant/maternal health and opioid outcomes. Likewise, CHCs reporting fewer problems for participation developed in counties with poor infant/maternal health, poor opioid outcomes, and more people without healthcare coverage. This pilot study provides a framework for iterative CHC evaluation. As the evidence grows, we will make recommendations for best practices that optimize CHC partnerships to improve local health in rural areas.

AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to assess caregiver comfort regarding adolescent completion of computerized health screening questionnaires created for adolescents. Methods We conducted a mixed-method, cross-sectional survey of caregivers of adolescent patients (n = 104) aged 12–18 years who had a medical visit between June 2017 and August 2017. Topics assessed included who completed the questionnaire, caregiver comfort and concern regarding questionnaire data, and caregiver reasons for involvement in completing the questionnaire. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the age of the adolescent and caregiver involvement in the questionnaire. Results The majority of adolescents (64%) reported independent completion of the questionnaire. Thirteen percent of caregivers completed the questionnaire with no involvement of the adolescent and 23% reported that caregivers and adolescents completed the questionnaire in tandem. The majority of caregivers (84%) were comfortable with adolescents completing the questionnaire. A variety of reasons were identified for caregivers completing the questionnaire (time constraints, 22%; adolescent requested caregiver help, 19%; caregiver desired to answer questions, 14%; caregiver did not realize that the questionnaire was intended for the adolescent, 11%; caregiver believed that the adolescent was too young to respond alone, 11%). Caregiver comfort with adolescent completing the questionnaire increase with age. Conclusion We found the reason most caregivers gave for completing the questionnaires were related to clinic processes (e.g. time constraints). Caregivers were more likely to complete the questionnaire with younger adolescents. Thus, pediatricians should consider how to best prepare families for initial questionnaires in primary care.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of Minnesota’s Return to Community Initiative (RTCI) on postdischarge outcomes for nursing home residents transitioned through the program. Data Sources: Secondary data were from the Minimum Data Set and RTCI staff (January 2015 to December 2016), state Medicaid eligibility files and death records. The sample consisted of 29,201 nursing home discharges in Minnesota occurring in 2015. Research Design: Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare 1-year postdischarge outcomes of nursing home readmission, mortality, and Medicaid conversion for RTCI assisted community discharges and a propensity-matched sample of unassisted community discharges. Results: The majority (60%) of RTCI assisted discharges remained alive, in the community and not having converted at Medicaid at 1 year after discharge. Time to mortality was significantly lower for the assisted group than the unassisted group, but time to readmission and Medicaid conversion were similar. Conclusion: The RTCI assisted residents fared well postdischarge in their time to mortality, nursing home readmission, and Medicaid conversion; they lived longer than a propensity-matched sample of their peers.

AB  - Risk stratification is a system by which clinically meaningful separation of risk is achieved in a group of otherwise similar persons. Although parametric logistic regression dominates risk prediction, use of nonparametric and semiparametric methods, including artificial neural networks, is increasing. These statistical-learning and machine-learning methods, along with simple rules, are collectively referred to as “artificial intelligence” (AI). AI requires knowledge of study validity, understanding of model metrics, and determination of whether and to what extent the model can and should be applied to the patient or population under consideration. Further investigation is needed, especially in model validation and impact assessment.

AB  - The intravesical instillation of mitomycin C immediately following surgery for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer has been shown to be efficacious in reducing cancer recurrence. As a result, the American Urological Association adopted guidelines for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer care to support its use in low to intermediate risk patients. Despite this, urologists' use of this drug following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) has been reported as low as 5% or less. Our study objective was to better understand the barriers urologists experience in using mitomycin C.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 practicing urologists at 4 geographically distinct practice locations throughout Indiana between 2017 and 2018. Cognitive task analysis was used to explore factors that influenced their clinician decision-making about Mitomycin C use following TURBT in specific patient cases. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using immersion/crystallization to identify emergent themes.The median age of the urologists interviewed was 44 (IQR 40-48). Eighty-five percent were male. Approximately 30% had completed urologic fellowship training; 62% were in private practice. Three major themes related to the use of mitomycin C emerged: cumbersome workflow processes, urologists' fears of side effects, and issues of identifying patients most likely to benefit.Workflow, fear, and value are key factors and also represent complexities of translating efficacy into effectiveness for a drug with known benefits to patients. Areas of potential intervention development to improve the use of mitomycin C to reduce recurrence of bladder cancer are suggested. Alternatives such as gemcitabine may also help overcome these barriers.

AB  - Abstract Objective With the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth, primary care providers must identify patients at high risk and implement evidence-based screening promptly. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) provide clinicians with personalized reminders according to best evidence. One example is the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system, which, as we have previously shown, significantly improves screening for T2D. Given that the long-term success of any CDSS depends on its acceptability and its users' perceptions, we examined what clinicians think of the CHICA diabetes module. Methods CHICA users completed an annual quality improvement and satisfaction questionnaire. Between May and August of 2015 and 2016, the survey included two statements related to the T2D-module: (1) “CHICA improves my ability to identify patients who might benefit from screening for T2D” and (2) “CHICA makes it easier to get the lab tests necessary to identify patients who have diabetes or prediabetes.” Answers were scored using a 5-point Likert scale and were later converted to a 2-point scale: agree and disagree. The Pearson chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between responses and the respondents. Answers per cohort were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Results The majority of respondents (N = 60) agreed that CHICA improved their ability to identify patients who might benefit from screening but disagreed as to whether it helped them get the necessary laboratories. Scores were comparable across both years. Conclusion CHICA was endorsed as being effective for T2D screening. Research is needed to improve satisfaction for getting laboratories with CHICA.

AB  - Precision health's more individualized molecular approach will enrich our understanding of disease etiology and patient outcomes. Universal implementation of precision health will not be feasible, however, until there is much greater automation of processes related to genomic data transmission, transformation, and interpretation. In this paper, we describe a framework for genomic data flow developed by the Clinical Informatics Work Group of the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) IGNITE Network consortium. We subsequently report the results of a genomic data flow survey administered to sites funded by NIH-NHGRI for large scale genomic medicine implementations. Finally, we discuss insights and challenges identified through these survey results as they relate to both the current and a desirable future state of genomic data flow.

AB  - Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is useful for identifying genetic variants correlated with gene expression, however, it cannot distinguish between causal and nearby non-functional variants. Because the majority of disease-associated SNPs are located in regulatory regions, they can impact allele-specific binding (ASB) of transcription factors and result in differential expression of the target gene alleles. In this study, our aim was to identify functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. Here, we present regSNPs-ASB, a generalized linear model-based approach to identify regulatory SNPs that are located in transcription factor binding sites. The input for this model includes ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) raw read counts from heterozygous loci, where differential transposase-cleavage patterns between two alleles indicate preferential transcription factor binding to one of the alleles. Using regSNPs-ASB, we identified 53 regulatory SNPs in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and 125 regulatory SNPs in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). By integrating the regSNPs-ASB output with RNA-seq experimental data and publicly available chromatin interaction data from MCF-7 cells, we found that these 53 regulatory SNPs were associated with 74 potential target genes and that 32 (43%) of these genes showed significant allele-specific expression. By comparing all of the MCF-7 and MSC regulatory SNPs to the eQTLs in the Genome-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project database, we found that 30% (16/53) of the regulatory SNPs in MCF-7 and 43% (52/122) of the regulatory SNPs in MSC were also in eQTL regions. The enrichment of regulatory SNPs in eQTLs indicated that many of them are likely responsible for allelic differences in gene expression (chi-square test, p-value < 0.01). In summary, we conclude that regSNPs-ASB is a useful tool for identifying causal variants from ATAC-seq data. This new computational tool will enable efficient prioritization of genetic variants identified as eQTL for further studies to validate their causal regulatory function. Ultimately, identifying causal genetic variants will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and the eventual development of potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Background In an effort to reduce the high rate of suicide among post-9/11 veterans, a collaborative team within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has developed a holistic community-based health promotion program designed to facilitate social and self-connectedness. The purpose of this study was to elicit veteran and stakeholder feedback to prepare the program for piloting and implementation. Methods Focus groups and interviews were conducted with post-9/11 veterans and veteran stakeholders (e.g., VA clinicians) to elicit feedback regarding the health promotion program. Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Qualitative thematic analysis identified key themes emerging from the focus groups and interviews. Results Seven focus groups (3 Veteran groups, 4 stakeholder groups) and 3 interviews (2 Veterans, 1 stakeholder) were conducted with 41 participants (14 veterans, 27 stakeholders). Overall, participants had a positive perception of the program. Thematic analysis revealed shared perspectives that provided insight into 1) enhancing program recruitment and retention, 2) the perceived ability of a health promotion program to provide more holistic, veteran-centered care, and 3) using health promotion programs to help veterans establish structure in their daily lives. Conclusions Findings indicated an overall acceptance of the program, and participants’ perspectives on how to reduce barriers and enhance facilitators can inform the development of a larger-scale health promotion program that can be tested through future research. While discussion questions were specifically focused on the program in this study, findings can be considered more broadly for the design and implementation of related programs to effectively improve the health and wellness of post-9/11 veterans.

AB  - Objectives To provide an estimate and level of uncertainty for Medicaid cost savings due to Minnesota's Return to Community Initiative (RTCI). Design Medicaid cost savings are estimated using a semi-Markov model and simulation approach. Setting and Participants RTCI is a statewide program that assists private paying nursing home residents with discharge to the community. When originally proposed, it was expected that the program would reduce state Medicaid expenditures, primarily through the shifting of residents from nursing homes to a less costly community setting. In prior analysis, we estimated that approximately 1 in 9 residents targeted for transition by the program would not have returned to the community without the RTCI. Accurate cost savings estimates require consideration of complex resident care trajectories, that is, nursing home readmissions, use of assisted living and community-based services, and mortality. Measures Data were from 30,234 private pay nursing home residents admitted during 2011, primarily for post-acute stays, to 378 facilities in Minnesota, and followed for 4 years postadmission for outcomes and time to event. Resident characteristics were taken from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) admission assessment. We modeled variability in care trajectories with a semi-Markov formulation. Transition probabilities were estimated using Multinomial regression. Time to event was modeled using the best-fitting, positive, right-skewed distribution for each path. The simulation was run (1000 times) with and without the RTCI impact to estimate change in Medicaid days in various settings. Results Program savings was estimated at $4.1 million per year of effort over a 4-year accumulation period. Conclusions and Implications The RTCI produced a modest Medicaid cost savings in excess of the annual program budget of $3.5 million. Findings from the semi-Markov model and simulation increase our understanding of care transitions between nursing home, community, Medicaid status, and mortality.

AB  - Surveillance of gonorrhea (GC), the second most common notifiable disease in the United States, depends on case reports. Population-level data that contain the number of individuals tested in addition to morbidity are lacking. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from individuals tested for GC recorded in a sexually transmitted disease (STD) registry in the state of Indiana. Descriptive statistics were performed, and a Poisson generalized linear model was used to evaluate the number of individuals tested for GC and the positivity rate. GC cases from a subset of the registry were compared to CDC counts to determine the completeness of the registry. A total of 1,870,811 GC tests were linked to 627,870 unique individuals. Individuals tested for GC increased from 54,334 in 2004 to 269,701 in 2016; likewise, GC cases increased from 2,039 to 5,997. However, positivity rate decreased from 3.75% in 2004 to 2.22% in 2016. The difference in the number of GC cases captured by the registry and those reported to the CDC was not statistically significant (P = 0.0665). Population-level data from an STD registry combining electronic medical records and public health case data may inform STD control efforts. In Indiana, increased testing rates appeared to correlate with increased GC morbidity.

AB  - To characterize pretransfer on-site nursing home (NH) management, transfer disposition, and hospital discharge diagnoses of long-stay residents transferred for behavioral concerns.This was a secondary data analysis of the Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care project, in which clinical staff employed in the NH setting conducted medical, transitional, and palliative care quality improvement initiatives and gathered data related to resident transfers to the emergency department/hospital setting. R software and Microsoft Excel were used to characterize a subset of transfers prompted by behavioral concerns.NHs in central Indiana were utilized (N = 19).This study included long-stay NH residents with behavioral concerns prompting transfer for acute emergency department/hospital evaluation (N = 355 transfers).The measures used in this study were symptoms prompting transfer, resident demographics and baseline characteristics (Minimum Data Set 3.0 variables including scores for the Cognitive Function Scale, ADL Functional Status, behavioral symptoms directed toward others, and preexisting psychiatric diagnoses), on-site management (e.g., medical evaluation in person or by phone, testing, and interventions), avoidability rating, transfer disposition (inpatient vs emergency department only), and hospital discharge diagnoses.Over half of the transfers, 56%, had a medical evaluation before transfer, and diagnostic testing was conducted before 31% of transfers. After transfer, 80% were admitted. The most common hospital discharge diagnoses were dementia-related behaviors (27%) and altered mental status (27%), followed by a number of medical diagnoses.Most transfers for behavioral concerns merited hospital admission, and medical discharge diagnoses were common. There remain significant opportunities to improve pretransfer management of NH transfers for behavioral concerns.

AB  - As the number of Veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and at risk for needing Long Term Services and Supports increases, VHA is shifting from institutional to Home and Community Based Services, such as the Veteran-Directed Care (VDC) program. VDC is a multi-sector program implemented as a collaboration between individual VHA medical centers (VAMCs) and Aging and Disability Network Agencies (ADNAs), entities that sit outside the VHA. Factors that affect establishment of effective multi-sector programs such as VDC are poorly understood, limiting ability to effectively deliver and scale programs. We conducted a qualitative study to describe factors affecting the interorganizational implementation context of VDC. Using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we interviewed VDC coordinators from seven different VAMC-ADNA partnerships that initiated the VDC program between 2017 and 2018. We identified eight CFIR determinants which manifested similarly for the VAMCs and ADNAs: evidence strength and quality, relative advantage, adaptability, tension for change, access to knowledge and information, self-efficacy; engaging, and champions. We identified three CFIR determinants that varied dramatically across VAMCs and ADNAs: available resources, implementation climate, and relative priority. Our results suggest that interorganizational context plays a critical and dynamic role within multi-sector collaborations.

AB  - Health information exchange (HIE) capabilities are tied to health care organizations' strategic and business goals. As a technology that connects information from different organizations, HIE may be a source of competitive advantage and a path to improvements in performance.The aim of the study was to identify the impact of hospitals' use of HIE capabilities on outcomes that may be sensitive to changes in various contracting arrangements and referral patterns arising from improved connectivity.Using a panel of community hospitals in nine states, we examined the association between the number of different data types the hospital could exchange via HIE and changes in market share, payer mix, and operating margin (2010-2014). Regression models that controlled for the number of different data types shared intraorganizationally and other time-varying factors and included both hospital and time fixed effects were used for adjusted estimates of the relationships between changes in HIE capabilities and outcomes.Increasing HIE capability was associated with a 13 percentage point increase in a hospital's discharges that were covered by commercial insurers or Medicare (i.e., payer mix). Conversely, increasing intraorganizational information sharing was associated with a 9.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of discharges covered by commercial insurers or Medicare. Increasing HIE capability or intraorganizational information sharing was not associated with increased market share nor with operating margin.Improving information sharing with external organizations may be an approach to support strategic business goals.Organizations may be served by identifying ways to leverage HIE instead of focusing on intraorganizational exchange capabilities.

Data on health services utilization for 1-year post-injury were extracted from electronic medical and administrative records. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to characterize the cohort and a subgroup of superutilizers of health services.Results: One year after traumatic brain injury, 56% of participants used emergency department services, 80% received inpatient services, and 93% utilized outpatient health services. Superutilizers had ≥3 emergency department visits, ≥3 inpatient admissions, or ≥26 outpatient visits 1-year post-injury. Twenty-six percent of participants were superutilizers of emergency department services, 30% of inpatient services, and 26% of outpatient services. Superutilizers contributed to 81% of emergency department visits, 70% of inpatient visits, and 60% of outpatient visits. Factors associated with being a superutilizer included sex, race, residence, and insurance type.Conclusions: Several patient characteristics and demographic factors influenced patients’ healthcare utilization post-TBI. Findings provide opportunities for developing targeted interventions to improve patients’ health and traumatic brain injury-related healthcare delivery.

AB  - Abstract Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a complex disease and is comprised of several histological subtypes, the most frequent of which are clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC). While lots of studies have been performed to investigate the molecular characterizations of different subtypes of RCC, our knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms are still incomplete. As molecular alterations are eventually reflected on the pathway level to execute certain biological functions, characterizing the pathway perturbations is crucial for understanding tumorigenesis and development of RCC. Methods In this study, we investigated the pathway perturbations of various RCC subtype against normal tissue based on differential expressed genes within a certain pathway. We explored the potential upstream regulators of subtype-specific pathways with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). We also evaluated the relationships between subtype-specific pathways and clinical outcome with survival analysis. Results In this study, we carried out a pathway-based analysis to explore the mechanisms of various RCC subtypes with TCGA RNA-seq data. Both commonly altered pathways and subtype-specific pathways were detected. To identify the distinctive characteristics of each subtype, we focused on subtype-specific perturbed pathways. Specifically, we observed that some of the altered pathways were regulated by several recurrent upstream regulators which presenting different expression patterns among distinct RCC subtypes. We also noticed that a large number of perturbed pathways were controlled by the subtype-specific upstream regulators. Moreover, we also evaluated the relationships between perturbed pathways and clinical outcome. Prognostic pathways were identified and their roles in tumor development and progression were inferred. Conclusions In summary, we evaluated the relationships among pathway perturbations, upstream regulators and clinical outcome for differential subtypes in RCC. We hypothesized that the alterations of common upstream regulators as well as subtype-specific upstream regulators work together to affect the downstream pathway perturbations and drive cancer initialization and prognosis. Our findings not only increase our understanding of the mechanisms of various RCC subtypes, but also provide targets for personalized therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Medication errors are prevalent in healthcare institutions worldwide, often arising from difficulties in care coordination among primary care providers, specialists, and pharmacists. Greater knowledge about care coordination surrounding medication safety incidents can inform efforts to improve patient safety.To identify strategies that hospital and outpatient healthcare professionals (HCPs) use, and barriers encountered, when they coordinate care during a medication safety incident involving an adverse drug reaction, drug-drug interaction, or drug-renal concern.We asked HCPs to complete a form whenever they encountered these incidents and intervened to prevent or mitigate patient harm. We stratified incidents across HCP roles and incident categories to conduct follow-up cognitive task analysis interviews with HCPs.We invited all physicians and pharmacists working in inpatient or outpatient care at a tertiary Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We examined 24 incidents: 12 from physicians and 12 from pharmacists, with a total of 8 incidents per category.Interviews were transcribed and analyzed via a two-stage inductive, qualitative analysis. In stage 1, we analyzed each incident to identify decision requirements. In stage 2, we analyzed results across incidents to identify emergent themes.Most incidents (19, 79%) were from outpatient care. HCPs relied on four main strategies to coordinate care: cognitive decentering; collaborative decision-making; back-up behaviors; and contingency planning. HCPs encountered four main barriers: role ambiguity and constraints, breakdowns (e.g., delays) in care, challenges related to the electronic health record, and factors that increased coordination complexity. Each strategy and barrier occurred across all incident categories and HCP groups. Pharmacists went to extra effort to ensure safety plans were implemented.Similar strategies and barriers were evident across HCP groups and incident types. Strategies for enhancing patient safety may be strengthened by deliberate organizational support. Some barriers could be addressed by improving work systems.

AB  - Objectives To compare clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with and without diabetes. Sample & setting CRC survivors (N = 3,287) were identified from a statewide electronic health record database using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Data were extracted on adults aged 21 years or older with an initial diagnosis of stage II or III CRC with diabetes present before CRC diagnosis or no diagnosis of diabetes (control). Methods & variables ICD codes were used to extract diabetes diagnosis and clinical outcome variables. Healthcare utilization was determined by encounter type. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, multivariable logistic, and Cox regression. Results CRC survivors with diabetes were more likely to develop anemia and infection than CRC survivors without diabetes. In addition, CRC survivors with diabetes were more likely to utilize emergency resources sooner than CRC survivors without diabetes. Implications for nursing Oncology nurses can facilitate the early identification of high-risk survivor groups, reducing negative clinical outcomes and unnecessarily high healthcare resource utilization in CRC survivors with diabetes.

AB  - As the coronavirus pandemic progressed through the United States, Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services (IEMS) identified a gap between the health system capacity and the projected need to support an overwhelmed health care system. In addressing emergencies or special cases, each medical institution in a metropolitan area typically has a siloed process for capturing emergency patient records. These approaches vary in technical capabilities and may include use of an electronic medical record system (EMR) or a hybrid paper/EMR process. Given the projected volume of patients for the COVID-19 pandemic and the proposed multi-institutional team approach needed in case of significant provider illness, IEMS sought a simple, efficient, consolidated EMR solution to support planning for the potential capacity gap. IEMS approached Regenstrief Institute (RI), an established partner with experience in supporting OpenMRS, a global good EMR platform that had been deployed in multiple settings globally.The purpose of this project was to determine if OpenMRS, a global good, could be used to quickly stand up a system that would meet the needs for health emergency data collection and reporting.The team used an "all hands on deck" approach, bringing together technical and subject matter experts, and a human-centered and iterative process to ensure the system met the key needs of IEMS. The OpenMRS Reference Application was adapted to the specific need and deployed as Docker containers to servers within the Indiana Health Information Exchange.In less than two weeks, the Regenstrief team was able to install, configure and set up a working version of OpenMRS to support the desired electronic record requirements for the IEMS disaster field clinics. Using a human-centered approach, the RI team developed, tested, and released a user-friendly, installation-ready solution complete with an end user manual and a base support plan. IEMS and RI are sharing this approach to demonstrate how a global good can quickly generate a solution for COVID-19 and other disaster responses.Open source global goods can rapidly be adapted to meet local needs in an emergency. OpenMRS can be adapted to meet the needs of basic emergency medical services registration, triage, and basic data collection.

AB  - Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a rare but fatal risk that patients, parents, and professional societies clearly recommend discussing with patients and families. However, this conversation does not routinely happen.This pilot study aimed to demonstrate whether computerized decision support could increase patient communication about SUDEP.A prospective before-and-after study of the effect of computerized decision support on delivery of SUDEP counseling. The intervention was a screening, alerting, education, and follow-up SUDEP module for an existing computerized decision support system (the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation [CHICA]) in five urban pediatric primary care clinics. Families of children with epilepsy were contacted by telephone before and after implementation to assess if the clinician discussed SUDEP at their respective encounters.The CHICA-SUDEP module screened 7,154 children age 0 to 21 years for seizures over 7 months; 108 (1.5%) reported epilepsy. We interviewed 101 families after primary care encounters (75 before and 26 after implementation) over 9 months. After starting CHICA-SUDEP, the number of caregivers who reported discussing SUDEP with their child's clinician more than doubled from 21% (16/75) to 46% (12/26; p = 0.03), and when the parent recalled who brought up the topic, 80% of the time it was the clinician. The differences between timing and sampling methodologies of before and after intervention cohorts could have led to potential sampling and recall bias.Clinician-family discussions about SUDEP significantly increased in pediatric primary care clinics after introducing a systematic, computerized screening and decision support module. These tools demonstrate potential for increasing patient-centered education about SUDEP, as well as incorporating other guideline-recommended algorithms into primary and subspecialty cares.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03502759.

AB  - Patients with advanced colorectal adenomas (AAs) are directed to undergo intensive surveillance. However, the benefit derived from surveillance may be outweighed by the risk of death from non-colorectal cancer (CRC) causes, leading to uncertainty on how best to individualize follow-up. The aim of this study was to derive a risk prediction model and risk index that estimate and stratify the risk for non-CRC cancer mortality (NCM) subsequent to diagnosis and removal of AA.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of veterans ≥40 years old who had colonoscopy for diagnostic or screening indications at 13 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers between 2002 and 2009 and had 1 or more AAs. The primary outcome was NCM using a fixed follow-up time period of 5 years. Logistic regression using the lasso technique was used to identify factors independently associated with NCM, and an index based on points from regression coefficients was constructed to estimate risk of 5-year NCM.We identified 2943 veterans with AA (mean age [standard deviation] 63 [8.6] years, 98% male, 74% white), with an overall 5-year mortality of 16.7%, which was nearly all due to NCM (16.6%). Age, comorbidity burden, specific comorbid conditions, and hospitalization within the preceding year were independently associated with NCM. The risk prediction model had a goodness of fit (calibration) P value of .41 and c-statistic (discrimination) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.76). On the basis of comparable 5-year risks of NCM, the scores comprised 3 risk categories: low (score of 0-1), intermediate (score of 2-4), and high (score of ≥5), in which NCM occurred in 6.5%, 14.1%, and 33.2%, respectively.We derived a risk prediction model that identifies veterans with advanced adenomas who are at high risk of NCM within 5 years, and who are thus unlikely to benefit from further surveillance.

AB  - Brain tumors, including pituitary adenomas (PA), cause anxiety and distress, with a high unmet need for information correlating with increased anxiety. Condition-specific education may alleviate anxiety. We explored patients' experience around the diagnosis of a PA and piloted a patient education intervention to address peridiagnostic anxiety in adults diagnosed with PA.Anxiety, patient satisfaction, patient knowledge, and need for information were measured prior to, immediately after, and 1 month following the appointment in this multimethods study. A phone interview to explore patient diagnostic and intervention experiences was analyzed using qualitative methods.A total of 17 patients participated in the study; 15 completed the interview. The baseline need for information was high. Disease-specific anxiety decreased, and patient knowledge and satisfaction increased significantly after the initial visit. Interview analysis identified 3 main themes: (1) the importance of communication; (2) the need for information; and (3) the impact of the diagnosis on patient experience.For patients with newly diagnosed PA, the diagnostic experience was associated with high levels of anxiety. Patients expressed a need for information. Information delivery reduced anxiety and had a positive impact on patient satisfaction.The study findings suggest a need for a streamlined diagnostic process with readily accessible information.

AB  - Background Reliable strategies for reducing postoperative readmissions remain elusive. As the emergency department (ED) is a frequent source of post-operative admissions, we investigated whether hospitals with high readmission rates also have high rates of post-discharge ED visits and high rates of readmission once an ED visit occurs. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,947,621 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing 1 of 5 common procedures in 2,894 hospitals between 2008 and 2011. We stratified hospitals into quintiles based on risk-standardized, 30-day post-discharge readmission rates (RSRR) and then compared rates of post-discharge ED visits, proportion readmitted from the ED, and readmissions within 7 days of ED discharge across these quintiles. Results RSRR varied widely across extremes of hospital quintiles (3.9% to 17.5%). Hospitals with either very low or very high RSRR had modest differences in rates of ED visits (12.4% versus 14.6%). In contrast, the proportion readmitted from the ED was nearly 3 times greater in Hospitals with very high RSRR compared with those with very low RSRR (12% versus 32.2%). These findings were consistent across all procedures. Importantly, hospitals with a low proportion readmitted from the ED did not exhibit an increased rate of readmission within 7 days of ED discharge. Conclusions Although hospitals experience similar rates of ED visits following major surgery, some EDs and their affiliated surgeons and health system may deliver care preventing readmissions without an increased short-term risk of readmission following ED discharge. Reducing 30-day readmissions requires greater attention to the coordination of care delivered in the ED.

AB  - Certain immigration factors may increase somatic, anxiety, and depressive (SAD) symptoms in Latinx immigrants. Our study examined prevalence of SAD symptoms in Latinx immigrants 18–29 presenting to primary care with correlates of acculturation, immigration, and legal status. SAD symptoms were measured using the PHQ-14, GAD-7 and PHQ-8. Moderate somatization (37%), anxiety (20%), and depression (25%) were common. Multivariable analysis found five immigration factors predicted a higher composite SAD score and the presence of each additional factor increased likelihood of a SAD score ≥ 20 (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5). SAD scores increased in a dose–response fashion (8.3, 10.5, 14.8, 17.1, 21.7, 29.3) with the added presence of each factor. Elevated SAD scores were not associated with gender, marital status, education, income, country of origin, or acculturation. Screening with our five factor immigration distress index may help identify patients at risk for higher SAD scores during a primary care visit.

AB  - Objective Situation awareness (SA) refers to people’s perception and understanding of their dynamic environment. In primary care, reduced SA among physicians increases errors in clinical decision-making and, correspondingly, patients’ risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Our objective was to understand the extent to which electronic health records (EHRs) support primary care physicians (PCPs)’ SA during clinical decision-making. Method We conducted a metanarrative review of papers in selected academic databases, including CINAHL and MEDLINE. Eligible studies included original peer-reviewed research published between January 2012 and August 2020 on PCP–EHR interactions. We iteratively queried, screened, and summarized literature focused on EHRs supporting PCPs’ clinical decision-making and care management for adults. Then, we mapped findings to an established SA framework to classify external factors (individual, task, and system) affecting PCPs’ levels of SA (1–Perception, 2–Comprehension, and 3–Projection) and identified SA barriers. Results From 1504 articles identified, we included and synthesized 19 studies. Study designs were largely noninterventional. Studies described EHR workflow misalignments, usability issues, and communication challenges. EHR information, including lab results and care plans, was characterized as incomplete, untimely, or irrelevant. Unmet information needs made it difficult for PCPs to obtain even basic SA, Level 1 SA. Prevalent barriers to PCPs developing SA with EHRs were errant mental models, attentional tunneling, and data overload. Conclusion Based on our review, EHRs do not support the development of higher levels of SA among PCPs. Review findings suggest SA-oriented design processes for health information technology could improve PCPs’ SA, satisfaction, and decision-making.

AB  - Purpose: To understand clinicians' perspectives on dialysis care of undocumented immigrants. Methods: A 21-item Internet-based survey using Survey Monkey® was sent to 765 physicians and nurses at a safety-net hospital located in Indianapolis, IN. Moral distress thermometer score was used to assess moral distress (MD). Participants were asked to rate their MD regarding five ethically challenging clinical situations: (1) frail patients with multiple comorbidities and poor quality of life, (2) patients with dementia, (3) a noncompliant patient with frequent emergency room (ER) visits, (4) violent patients with potential harm to others, and (5) undocumented immigrants receiving emergent dialysis only. Key Results: There were 299 of 775 participants (38.5% response rate) who completed the survey; 49.5% were physicians. Nearly half (48%) reported severe MD and 33% reported none to mild. In adjusted ordered logistic regression, females had significantly higher odds of MD (odds ratio [OR]=2.12, CI 1.03-4.33), and nurses had lower MD than fellows/residents (OR=0.14, CI 0.03-0.63). Over 70% of respondents attributed their distress to suffering of patients due to inadequate dialysis and tension between what is considered ethical and the law allows or forbids; 78% believed the patients' quality of life to be worse than those who receive routine hemodialysis. Among nephrologists, caring for these patients led to MD levels like that of dealing with a violent dialysis patient. Conclusions: Emergent-only dialysis causes significant MD in clinicians. Legal and fiscal policies need to be balanced with the ethical and moral commitments of providers for ensuring standard of care to all.

AB  - Background: Although religion and spirituality are important to adults with cancer and their family caregivers, few studies have tested spiritual care interventions in the outpatient setting. Aim: To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of chaplain-delivered, semi-structured spiritual care to adult outpatients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Design: In this pre/post pilot intervention study, board-certified chaplains utilized the Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention (SCAI) framework during 4 individual sessions. Surveys at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 weeks post-intervention assessed spiritual well-being, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and religious coping. Setting/Participants: We enrolled U.S. adult outpatients with or without an eligible family caregiver. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and at least 2 weeks post-diagnosis of incurable and advanced-stage lung or gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Results: Of 82 eligible patients, 24 enrolled (29.3%); of 22 eligible caregivers, 18 enrolled (81.8%). Four planned chaplain visits were completed by 87.5% of patients and 77.8% of caregivers. All enrolled participants completed baseline surveys, and more than 75% completed follow-up surveys at 2 of 3 time points. More than 80% of patients and caregivers reported they would recommend the sessions to a friend or family member. Patients’ spiritual well-being improved significantly at all timepoints compared to baseline: 1-week post (p &lt; .006), 6-weeks post (p &lt; .001), and 12-weeks post (p &lt; .004). Conclusions: Spiritual care through SCAI is feasible, acceptable, and shows promise in improving spiritual well-being and other important outcomes in advanced-stage cancer patients and family caregivers. Further investigation is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: Research eliciting patients' illness concerns has typically focused later in the cancer continuum, rather than during cancer treatments. Family caregiver concerns are overlooked during this time. Less is known about how patients and caregivers prioritize concerns during cancer treatments, which holds potential for improving supportive oncology care (ie, primary palliative care). The purpose of this study was to elicit and compare which domains of supportive oncology are of highest importance to patients and caregivers during cancer treatments. METHODS: Freelisting, a cognitive anthropology method, was used to elicit concerns in order of importance. Freelist data were analyzed using Smith's salience index. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a caregiver subsample to add explanatory insights. RESULTS: In descending order, pain, death, fear, family, and awful were salient Freelist items for patients (n = 65), whereas sadness, time-consuming, support, anger, tired, death, and frustration were salient for caregivers (n = 24). When integrated with supportive oncology domains, patients' concerns reflected a prioritization of the physical (pain) and emotional (death, fear, and awful) domains, with less emphasis on social (family) aspects. Caregivers' prioritized the emotional (sadness, anger, death, and frustration) and social (time-consuming and support) domains, with less emphasis on the physical (tired) aspects. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that enhancing primary palliative care delivery by oncology teams requires systems thinking to support both the patient and caregiver as the primary unit of care. Primary palliative care may be improved by prioritizing interventions that address physical concerns among patients as well as key social concerns among caregivers to support the complex caregiving role while patients undergo cancer treatments.

AB  - Abstract Background The number of congenital syphilis (CS) cases in the United States are increasing. Effective prevention of CS requires routine serologic testing and treatment of infected pregnant women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit and subsequent testing at 28 weeks gestation and delivery for women at increased risk. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of syphilis testing among pregnant women with a livebirth delivery from January 2014 to December 2016 in Marion County, Indiana. We extracted and linked maternal and infant data from the vital records in a local health department to electronic health records available in a regional health information exchange. We examined syphilis testing rates and factors associated with non-testing among women with livebirth delivery. We further examined these rates and factors among women who reside in syphilis prevalent areas. Results Among 21260 pregnancies that resulted in livebirths, syphilis testing in any trimester, including delivery, increased from 71.7% in 2014 to 86.6% in 2016. The number of maternal syphilis tests administered only at delivery decreased from 16.6% in 2014 to 4.04% in 2016. Among women living in areas with high syphilis rates, syphilis screening rates increased from 79.6% in 2014 to 94.2% in 2016. Conclusion Improvement in prenatal syphilis screening is apparent and encouraging, yet roughly 1-in-10 women do not receive syphilis screening during pregnancy. Adherence to recommendations set out by CDC improved over time. Given increasing congenital syphilis cases, the need for timely diagnoses and prevention of transmission from mother to fetus remains a priority for public health.

AB  - Repeated measurement of depression using summative scores of commonly used depression scales assumes that the construct is unidimensional and invariant across time, but little is known about the validity of these assumptions in stroke patients. The study examined the assumptions during the first year after mild to moderate stroke using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).Data were obtained from the 2014-2016 Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project, a population-based stroke surveillance study with longitudinal follow-up in Texas, United States. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the PHQ-8 at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke (n = 648, 542, 533, respectively). Dimensionality of the PHQ-8 was examined using exploratory bifactor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Based on a one-factor CFA model, longitudinal measurement invariance was examined by fitting configural, weak, strong and strict invariance models sequentially.Mean age was 65.6 (SD = 11.2), half were women, and 56.7% were Mexican American. Reliability measures suggested a generally unidimensional construct (Omega Hierarchical: 0.79-0.86), good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.84-0.88) and good temporal stability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.838). Configural invariance for equality of item-factor structure (RMSEA = 0.038, CFI = 0.982, WRMR = 0.970) was supported. Partial weak invariance for equality of factor loadings (p = 0.11) was supported by chi-square difference tests, whereas full longitudinal invariance was supported by changes in comparative fit index and root mean square error of approximation.The findings suggest the PHQ-8 may be a reasonable tool for repeated measurement of depression in stroke patients, and more research on its longitudinal psychometric properties is needed.

AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated disruption to outpatient mental health services after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inpatient mental health services have received less attention. The current study utilized an existing cohort of 33 Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) acute inpatient mental health units to examine disruptions to inpatient services. It further explored the association between patient demographic, clinical, and services variables on relapse rates. Inpatient admissions and therapeutic services (group and individual therapy and peer support) were lower amongst the COVID-19 sample than prior to the onset of COVID-19 while lengths of stay were longer. Relapse rates did not differ between cohorts. Patients with prior emergent services use as well as substance abuse or personality disorder diagnoses were at higher risk for relapse. Receiving group therapy while admitted was associated with lower risk of relapse. Inpatient mental health services saw substantial disruptions across the cohort. Inpatient mental health services, including group therapy, may be an important tool to prevent subsequent relapse.

AB  - Broader patient-reported experiences in oncology are largely unknown due to the lack of available information from traditional data sources. Online health community data provide an exploratory way to uncover these experiences at a large scale. Analyzing these data can guide further studies towards understanding patients' needs and experiences. However, analysis of online health data is inherently difficult due to the unstructured nature of these data and the variety of ways information can be expressed over text. Specifically, subscribers may not disclose critical information such as the age of the patient in their posts. In fact, the number of health forum posts that explicitly mention the age of the patient is significantly lower than the number of posts that do not include this information in the Reddit r/Cancer health forum under consideration in the present paper. Health-focused studies often need to consider or control for age as a confounder, hence the importance of having sufficient age data. This paper presents a methodology that can help classify health forum posts according to four age groups (0-17, 18-39, 40-64 and 65 + years) even when the posts do not contain explicit mention of the age of the patient. First, the subset of the posts that include explicit mention of the age of the patient is identified. Second, the explicit age clues are removed from these posts and used to train the proposed age classifier. The resulting classifier is able to infer the age of the patient using only implicit age clues with an average true positive rate (TPR) of 71%. This TPR is comparable to the average TPR of 69% obtained from human annotations for the same set of posts.

Previous versions: November 4, 2021: Ahead of Print Implementation Science is an emerging and complex field that primarily focuses on planning, influencing and/or evaluating the adoption of evidence-based practices.1 Evidence of the growing interest in implementation science methods is a 2020 special issue of the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science devoted to Dissemination and Implementation Sciences.2 This issue contains substantive and relevant summaries of current implementation research challenges and the state of the evidence around implementation frameworks and methods, stakeholder engagement strategies, operational and community partnerships, and implementation trial design. In this topical review, we summarize highlights from stroke-related implementation studies published in 2020, organized across the clinical spectrum of stroke care, to illustrate best practices, synthesize lessons learned, and identify implementation tools and methods that may be relevant to the cerebrovascular community.Implementation Science in Acute Stroke CareThe T3 trial (Triage, Treatment, and Transfer) tested a bundled intervention in emergency departments to improve triage, treatment, and transfer of patients with acute stroke. Although the intervention did not improve timeliness of care, an a priori planned implementation analysis was conducted after the trial had concluded. The analysis identified important barriers affecting intervention uptake, including staff readiness to change, fidelity to the protocols, and perceptions of professional boundaries.3 Understanding why this intervention was not successful should guide alternative strategies for future studies focused on improving delivery of acute stroke care in the emergency department setting. A meta-analysis of studies aiming to increase thrombolysis rates in acute stroke analyzed study findings using the behavior change wheel, a conceptual framework of factors that are posited as needing to be addressed to successfully implement complex interventions.4 Five behavior change wheel constructs were found to be commonly employed across these studies: education, persuasion, training, environmental restructuring, and enablement. However, no single strategy or combination of strategies appeared more successful than others for improving thrombolysis rates.Implementation Science in Posthospital Stroke CareThe COMPASS trial (Comprehensive Postacute Stroke Services) reported a process evaluation of the implementation of a transitional care model to improve poststroke outcomes across 19 hospitals in North Carolina. The authors identified organizational, individual, and community factors related to successful implementation.5 Facilitators of change included organizational readiness and the presence of champions; implementation challenges included start-up and staffing in multiple settings and integration of the intervention into existing diverse transitional care programs. The authors concluded the most significant factor identified was the importance of the organization’s commitment and capacity to making a change in how it delivers comprehensive stroke care.Implementation Science in Stroke RehabilitationThe Cochrane collaboration conducted a systematic review of implementation interventions to promote uptake of evidence-based stroke rehabilitation interventions.6 The review suggests it is unclear whether implementation interventions conducted to date actually increase rehabilitation provider or patient adherence to evidence-based practices, and the authors make important recommendations about improvements in design of these implementation studies, to better examine key components of intervention design, fidelity, and impact on provider behavior change. Focusing on intervention fidelity, another study of a community-based exercise program for patients with stroke illustrates use of a formative evaluation—using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication framework—to iteratively monitor and refine intervention implementation.7 A practical study employing a pre-/post design found that a bundle of knowledge translation activities applied within a prespecified framework (the Knowledge-to-Action Framework) was successful in promoting uptake and sustained use of a gait and balance assessment battery over 4 years of clinical implementation.8 This latter study has broad relevance given that many institutions aim to introduce stroke-related care delivery interventions, which are much more likely to be successful if an implementation framework is identified and applied during the planning stages.Implementation Science in Vascular Risk Factor ManagementImplementation of telemonitoring for hypertension was conducted across 75 primary care practices in Scotland, based on prior work to identify key barriers and facilitators, drawing on the capability, opportunity, motivation-behavior change framework, and a prior systematic review of diffusion of innovation approaches. This pragmatic trial found reductions in blood pressure and improved clinical efficiencies in practice. Qualitative evaluation that included staff and patient interviews as well as observation of practices found that integration of data into the routine clinical care systems was particularly critical to implementation success.9 Two implementation studies were reported related to atrial fibrillation management. Lessons from the IMPACT-AFib trial highlighted challenges in embedding pragmatic trials within a health plan, suggesting specific aspects of implementation that should be considered when the intervention occurs at the level of the health plan/insurance company.10 In another study, a pharmacist-led intervention to assist with early detection of atrial fibrillation was found to be feasible, with key drivers of success being the presence of a local champion and strategies enabling effective interprofessional communication.11Implementation Science Methods and ToolsAs evidenced in the work cited above, implementation of health care interventions is often complex and involves multiple stakeholders to facilitate successful program uptake and spread. Use of implementation methods and tools are necessary to deepen real-world learning from studies of complex stroke-related interventions. Several studies cited above demonstrated the benefit of using specific implementation frameworks to guide study design and outcome assessment, to expand our understanding about factors influencing success and failure of implementation of complex stroke care interventions.5,7–9,11 Other studies focused on specific or bundled implementation strategies,3,5,6 with attention to intervention fidelity,7 to identify key drivers of change. There were examples of use of formative evaluation to continually monitor ongoing interventions and incorporate implementation refinements to enhance uptake,7 and summative evaluation to identify generalizable lessons for future implementation of the intervention.11,12 Finally, 2 publications demonstrated the use of innovative implementation science tools, including a summary of methods of economic analysis of implementation interventions (including an example of acute stroke quality improvement assessment),13 and a Research Electronic Data Capture-based database to track stakeholder engagement in the COMPASS trial, an tool that may be of value to other implementation researchers.14Article InformationSources of FundingNone.DisclosuresDr Vickrey receives grant funding for studies of secondary stroke prevention from National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.Nonstandard Abbreviations and AcronymsCOMPASSComprehensive Post-Acute Stroke ServicesT3Triage, Treatment, and TransferTIDieRTemplate for Intervention Description and ReplicationFootnotesThe opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.For Sources of Funding and Disclosures, see page 4056.Correspondence to: Linda S.

AB  - Breast cancer survivors (BCS) are twice as likely to report symptoms of poor sleep as those without cancer. However, sleep disorders are under-assessed and under-treated among BCS. The purpose of this study was to determine the portion of BCS who completed referral visits to a sleep specialist and identify the acceptability, facilitators, and barriers to the screening and referral process.BCS, who reported having sleep problems, completed questionnaires to screen for symptoms suggestive of sleep disorders. Those with symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea, movement disorders, narcolepsy, insomnia syndrome, or circadian disorders, they were referred to a sleep medicine physician or behavioral sleep medicine psychologist. Two months after the referral, participants were interviewed about their perceptions of the acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to sleep screenings and referrals.Of 34 BCS assessed for eligibility, 29 were eligible and had sleep problems. Only eight of 29 participants (27.6%) completed the sleep referral process. Most thought the screening and referral process was acceptable. However, BCS identified barriers to completing the referral visit, including time, not seeing the need for treatment, insurance/sick leave concerns, and distance/transportation.Adequate evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders in BCS are rare. Creative solutions to address barriers to timely sleep referrals are needed to reduce long-term negative consequences of inadequate sleep.

AB  - Background: Families of critically ill patients and their healthcare team must make life and death decisions together. Ideally, intensive care unit team members collaborate in the support of patients and families as goals of care are clarified and care plans are created. Few interventions exist to improve collaboration around this process. Team-based communication skills training about goals-of-care conversations represents one promising intervention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a communication skills training workshop on coordination and collaboration among ICU team members. Design: Participants from a single institution completed surveys immediately before and six months after completion of the workshop. All participants, including nurses, physicians, social workers, and chaplains, completed a goals-of-care Relational Coordination survey. Nurses and physicians completed a Jefferson Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Nurse Collaboration (JSAPNC) survey. Results: Thirty-six participants were enrolled in three workshops. Seventeen and fifteen participants completed the relational coordination survey and JSAPNC respectively at both time points. The mean intergroup relational coordination index increased from 2.94 pre-intervention to 3.19 6-month post (P = .002, d= .89). Nurse relational coordination index ratings of all other groups increased from 2.84 pre-intervention to 3.08 6-month post (p = .004, d=1.23). Mean total scores on the JSAPNC survey did not change significantly from pre-intervention (53.8) to 6-month post (54.2, P = .45). Conclusion: Team-based communication skills training may improve ICU team relational coordination surrounding goals of care.

AB  - Health information exchange (HIE) notifications when patients experience cross-system acute care encounters offer an opportunity to provide timely transitions interventions to improve care across systems.To compare HIE notification followed by a post-hospital care transitions intervention (CTI) with HIE notification alone.Cluster-randomized controlled trial with group assignment by primary care team.Veterans 65 or older who received primary care at 2 VA facilities who consented to HIE and had a non-VA hospital admission or emergency department visit between 2016 and 2019.For all subjects, real-time HIE notification of the non-VA acute care encounter was sent to the VA primary care provider. Subjects assigned to HIE plus CTI received home visits and telephone calls from a VA social worker for 30 days after arrival home, focused on patient activation, medication and condition knowledge, patient-centered record-keeping, and follow-up.Primary outcome: 90-day hospital admission or readmission.emergency department visits, timely VA primary care team telephone and in-person follow-up, patients' understanding of their condition(s) and medication(s) using the Care Transitions Measure, and high-risk medication discrepancies.A total of 347 non-VA acute care encounters were included and assigned: 159 to HIE plus CTI and 188 to HIE alone. Veterans were 76.9 years old on average, 98.5% male, 67.8% White, 17.1% Black, and 15.1% other (including Hispanic). There was no difference in 90-day hospital admission or readmission between the HIE-plus-CTI and HIE-alone groups (25.8% vs. 20.2%, respectively; risk diff 5.6%; 95% CI - 3.3 to 14.5%, p = .25). There was also no difference in secondary outcomes.A care transitions intervention did not improve outcomes for veterans after a non-VA acute care encounter, as compared with HIE notification alone. Additional research is warranted to identify transitions services across systems that are implementable and could improve outcomes.

AB  - Background Cognitive impairment is common in intensive care unit survivors, pointing to the potential utility of a caregiver-based tool to screen for post–intensive care syndrome. Objective To validate the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor, Caregiver Version (HABC-M CG), as a caregiver-based tool to screen for post–intensive care syndrome. Methods A total of 116 patients who survived a stay in the intensive care unit completed standardized assessments of cognition, psychological symptoms, and physical functioning, and their caregivers completed the HABC-M CG. The Cronbach α was used to measure the internal consistency of the scale items. Validity of the HABC-M CG versus comparison tests was measured using the Spearman rank correlation. Generalized linear models were used to adjust for age, sex, and education level. Results The total scale and all subscales of the HABC-M CG showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88-0.93). Scores on the psychological subscale correlated with standardized measures of depressive symptoms (Spearman ρ = 0.58). Scores on the cognitive subscale correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score (Spearman ρ = −0.33). Scores on the functional subscale correlated with scores on the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (Spearman ρ = −0.36). Conclusion The HABC-M CG is a valid informant-based clinical tool for the assessment of symptoms of post– intensive care syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess the nutritional profile of denture wearers through a retrospective cohort study using nutritional biomarkers from matched electronic dental and health record (EDR‐EHR) data. Materials and methods The case group (denture wearers) included matched EDR‐EHR data of patients who received removable partial, complete, and implant‐supported prosthodontic treatments between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018, study time. The control (nondenture wearers) group did not have recorded denture treatments and included patient records within 1 year of the denture index date (first date of case patients’ receiving complete or partial denture) of the matching cases. The qualified patients’ EDR were matched with their EHR based on the availability of laboratory reports within 2 years of receiving the dentures (index date). Nutritional biomarkers were selected from laboratory reports for complete blood count, comprehensive and basic metabolic profile, lipid, and thyroid panels. Summary statistics were performed, and general linear mixed effect models were used to evaluate the rate of change over time (slope) of nutritional biomarkers before and after the index date. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to determine the differences between dentures and controls. Results The final cohort included 10,481 matched EDR‐EHR data with 3,519 denture wearers and 6,962 controls that contained laboratory results within the study time. The denture wearers’ mean age was 57 ±10 years and the control group was 56 ±10 years with 55% females in both groups. Pre‐post analysis among denture wearers revealed decreased serum albumin ( p = 0.002), calcium ( p = 0.039), creatinine ( p &lt; 0.001) during the post‐index time. Hemoglobin (Hb) was higher pre‐index, and was decreasing during the time period but did not change post‐index ( p &lt; 0.001). Among denture wearers, completely edentulous patients had a significant decrease in serum albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In partially edentulous patients, total cholesterol decreased ( p = 0.018) and TSH ( p = 0.004), BUN ( p &lt; 0.001) increased post‐index. Patients edentulous in either upper or lower arch had decreased BUN and eGFR during post‐index. Compared to controls, denture wearers showed decreased serum albumin and protein ( p = 0.008), serum calcium ( p = 0.001), and controls showed increased Hb ( p = 0.035) during post‐index. Conclusions The study results indicate nutritional biomarker variations among denture wearers suggesting a risk for undernutrition and the potential of using selected nutritional biomarkers to monitor nutritional profile.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Comprehensive headache care involves numerous specialties and components that have not been well documented or standardized. This study aimed to elicit best practices and characterize important elements of care to be provided in multidisciplinary headache centers. Methods Qualitative, semi‐structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of headache neurology specialists from across the US, using open‐ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Coded data were further analyzed using immersion/crystallization techniques for final interpretation. Results Mean years providing headache care was 17.7 (SD = 10.6). Twelve of the 13 participants held United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties headache certification. Six described their practice site as providing multidisciplinary headache care. Participants explained most of their patients had seen multiple doctors over many years, and had tried numerous unsuccessful treatments. They noted patients with chronic headache frequently present with comorbidities and become stigmatized. All participants asserted successful care depends on taking time to talk with and listen to patients, gain understanding, and earn trust. All participants believed multidisciplinary care is essential within a comprehensive headache center, along with staffing enough headache specialists, implementing detailed headache intake and follow‐up protocols, and providing the newest medications, neuromodulation devices, botulinum toxin injections, monoclonal antibodies, nerve blocks and infusions, and treatment from a health psychologist. Other essential services for a headache center are other behavioral health practitioners providing cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, biofeedback and pain management; and autonomic neurology, neuropsychology, vestibular audiology, sleep medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise physiology, speech therapy, nutrition, complementary integrative health modalities, and highly trained support staff. Conclusion While headache neurology specialists form the backbone of headache care, experts interviewed for this study maintained their specialty is just one of many types of care needed to adequately treat patients with chronic headache, and this is best provided in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary center.

AB  - Background: Behavioral, psychological, and physical symptoms are prevalent in advanced dementia, as well as major contributors to poor quality of life, health care costs, caregiver burden, and nursing home placement. Objectives: To determine the frequency and severity of symptoms in persons with advanced dementia living in the community, as well as the association between symptoms and satisfaction with care, and the identification of factors associated with symptom burden. Design: Baseline data from a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of collaborative care home-based management for patients with advanced dementia. Setting/Subjects: Two hundred and one patient-caregiver dyads from an urban area in the United States, who were still residing in the community. Measurements: Caregivers completed the Symptom Management in End-of-Life Dementia (SM-EOLD) and Satisfaction with Care in End-of-Life Dementia (SWC-EOLD) scales. Results: Patients' mean age was 83.1; 67.7% were women, and most were either White (50.2%) or African American (43.8%). Most (88.1%) had severe dementia (Functional Assessment Staging Tool [FAST] stage 6 or 7). SM-EOLD mean score was 29.3 (on 0-45 scale) and SWC-EOLD score was 32.6 (on 10-40 scale). Pain, agitation, anxiety, and resistiveness to care were present at least weekly in ≥40% of patients. Multivariable linear regression modeling showed that higher neuropsychiatric symptom severity (assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory), increased caregiver strain, and higher medical comorbidity were all independently associated with increased symptom burden. Satisfaction with care was high and had only a modest correlation (r = 0.20) with symptom burden. Conclusions: Community-dwelling patients with advanced dementia and their caregivers may benefit from home-based palliative care interventions to identify and manage burdensome symptoms.

AB  - Intrauterine devices, including levonorgestrel-releasing and copper devices, are highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptives. The potential risks associated with intrauterine devices are low and include uterine perforation and device expulsion.This study aimed to evaluate the risk of perforation and expulsion associated with levonorgestrel-releasing devices vs copper devices in clinical practice in the United States.The Association of Perforation and Expulsion of Intrauterine Device study was a retrospective cohort study of women aged ≤50 years with an intrauterine device insertion during 2001 to 2018 and information on intrauterine device type and patient and medical characteristics. Of note, 4 research sites with access to electronic health records contributed data for the study: 3 Kaiser Permanente-integrated healthcare systems (Northern California, Southern California, and Washington) and 1 healthcare system using data from a healthcare information exchange in Indiana (Regenstrief Institute). Perforation was classified as any extension of the device into or through the myometrium. Expulsion was classified as complete (not visible in the uterus or abdomen or patient reported) or partial (any portion in the cervix or malpositioned). We estimated the crude incidence rates and crude cumulative incidence by intrauterine device type. The risks of perforation and expulsion associated with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices vs copper intrauterine devices were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression with propensity score overlap weighting to adjust for confounders.Among 322,898 women included in this analysis, the incidence rates of perforation per 1000 person-years were 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.53-1.76) for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices and 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48) for copper intrauterine devices; 1-year and 5-year crude cumulative incidence was 0.22% (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.24) and 0.63% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.68) for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices and 0.16% (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.20) and 0.55% (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.68) for copper intrauterine devices, respectively. The incidence rates of expulsion per 1000 person-years were 13.95 (95% confidence interval, 13.63-14.28) for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices and 14.08 (95% confidence interval, 13.44-14.75) for copper intrauterine devices; 1-year and 5-year crude cumulative incidence was 2.30% (95% confidence interval, 2.24-2.36) and 4.52% (95% confidence interval, 4.40-4.65) for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices and 2.30% (95% confidence interval, 2.18-2.44) and 4.82 (95% confidence interval, 4.56-5.10) for copper intrauterine devices, respectively. Comparing levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices with copper intrauterine devices, the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.49 (95% confidence intervals, 1.25-1.78) for perforation and 0.69 (95% confidence intervals, 0.65-0.73) for expulsion.After adjusting for potential confounders, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices were associated with an increased risk of uterine perforation and a decreased risk of expulsion relative to copper intrauterine devices. Given that the absolute numbers of these events are low in both groups, these differences may not be clinically meaningful.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Minnesota’s implementation of a new nursing home value-based reimbursement (VBR) system in 2016 presented an opportunity to compare the response of nursing homes (NHs) to financial incentives to improve their quality and efficiency. The state substantially increased reimbursement for care-related costs and tied this rate increase to a composite quality score. Coinciding with rate increases of the new VBR system was an increase in ownership changes, with new owners being primarily for-profit entities from outside of Minnesota, including several private equity firms. Our objective was to examine NHs that underwent a change in ownership to determine their cost and quality response to the change. Research Design and Methods Our sample consists of 342 Minnesota NHs that submitted Medicaid cost reports each year from 2013 to 2019. A time differential two-way fixed-effects difference-in-difference model is used to assess changes in quality metrics by comparing measures in years prior to and years following the sale for NHs that changed ownership versus NHs with consistent ownership. Nursing home characteristics, revenue, and spending patterns are examined to understand differences in performance. Results Those NHs with ownership change experienced a decline in quality scores with notable changes to expenditure patterns. They performed worse on Minnesota Department of Health inspection scores and had nonsignificant declines in measures of quality of life and clinical care. They had declining staff dental and medical benefits and occupancy rates, greater revenue growth from Medicare Part B, and larger increases in administrative management fees. Discussion and Implications Minnesota like many other states has given wide latitude for nursing home ownership changes, without specific oversight for the quality of care and expenditure patterns of new owners. Recommendations include strict guidelines for the transparency of ownership structures, quality performance targets, rigorous financial auditing, and enhanced regulatory oversight.

AB  - Abstract High-dimensional, localized ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing is now possible owing to recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST). ST is based on highly multiplexed sequence analysis and uses barcodes to match the sequenced reads to their respective tissue locations. ST expression data suffer from high noise and dropout events; however, smoothing techniques have the promise to improve the data interpretability prior to performing downstream analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data similarly suffer from these limitations, and smoothing methods developed for scRNA-seq can only utilize associations in transcriptome space (also known as one-factor smoothing methods). Since they do not account for spatial relationships, these one-factor smoothing methods cannot take full advantage of ST data. In this study, we present a novel two-factor smoothing technique, spatial and pattern combined smoothing (SPCS), that employs the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique to utilize information from transcriptome and spatial relationships. By performing SPCS on multiple ST slides from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and simulated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) datasets, smoothed ST slides have better separability, partition accuracy and biological interpretability than the ones smoothed by preexisting one-factor methods. Source code of SPCS is provided in Github (https://github.com/Usos/SPCS).

Previous versions: April 4, 2022: Ahead of Print In 2021, studies evaluated a variety of quality improvement (QI) interventions targeting processes of care across the continuum of care (ie, prehospital, acute hospital, and posthospital discharge) for patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Commonalities among the programs that effectively improved quality of care included: multidisciplinary/interprofessional teams which set policy and provided facilitation; order sets, clinical pathways, and protocols; clearly articulating guideline-concordant care elements that became the focus of QI activities and that were subject to ongoing measurement and audit-and-feedback; process mapping; Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles; and multifaceted education programs. Future studies should seek to include patients and caregivers in QI, examine approaches to sustaining QI after active implementation has ended, focus on reducing health care disparities, and evaluate interventions to improve care in the posthospital period. Studies of QI interventions should not only examine whether average quality of care is improved but also if heterogeneity across patients or hospitals is reduced; seeking to ensure that all patients across all hospitals receive the stroke care for which they are eligible.Globally, there is a commitment to ensuring that all patients with stroke or TIA have access to evidence-based treatments to improve survival and recovery. Across the stroke continuum of care from preadmission through acute hospital admission to postdischarge (Figure), the learning health system provides a model of continuous QI (eg, clinical evidence, guidelines, data, and implementation).1 Studies published in 2021 describe advances in stroke QI across local, regional and national systems of care, as well as within components of the stroke continuum of care, and are summarized following.Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure. Quality improvement initiatives to improve stroke care.Systems of Care QIStudies sought to understand or support existing stroke system of care in the United States2 and Canada3 and to develop new stroke systems of care in China,4,5 Chile,6 and Panamá.7 For example, Zusevics et al2 used development evaluation to examine the stroke system of care for the Wisconsin Coverdell Stroke Program. Through process mapping and stakeholder interviews, quality practices were identified, including areas requiring improvement. The development evaluation methodology provided opportunities for stakeholders to strategize together and to identify opportunities to collaborate.Process mapping was also used in a province-wide stroke system improvement initiative (Saskatchewan Acute Stroke Pathway) in 9 Canadian hospitals which identified QI priorities and resource gaps focused on hyperacute stroke care.3 The comprehensive QI program included: performance monitoring with audit-and-feedback; standardized order sets; educational workshops; discipline-specific interventions (eg, radiology) to improve timeliness, communication, and documentation; and PDSA cycles. The implementation of this initiative led to improvements for door-to-imaging, door-to-needle, and door-to-groin times across the province.The China Stroke Prevention Project Committee established a stroke center network including a national stroke data center.4 This comprehensive program included screening and stroke prevention elements, prehospital rapid response systems, construction of 380 stroke centers, and a network establishment. This stroke system of care improved care provision (eg, decreased median door-to-needle time from 50 to 48 minutes; P<0.05). Another study from China described the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance which evaluated a multifaceted acute stroke and TIA QI program that included web-based data collection and performance feedback, and a series of collaborative workshops and webinars led by clinical and QI experts.5 Their cohort included over a million patients with stroke or TIA from 1476 volunteer hospitals. Although improvements in several quality metrics (eg, anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation) were observed over time, substantial opportunities for improvement remained (eg, the defect-free care rate remained well below 40%); heterogeneity in quality existed across cerebrovascular event types (eg, ischemic stroke versus subarachnoid hemorrhage) and across hospitals.A new stroke care network was also developed in Chile, with a single mechanical thrombectomy-capable stroke center and five primary stroke centers, which improved access to mechanical thrombectomy.6 Likewise, the first stroke program in Central America was implemented in Panamá using an evidence-based 7 step process that could serve as a model for program development and implementation across the spectrum of resource availability contexts (eg, emerging high-income countries).7Prehospital Care QISix QI studies reported ambulance and emergency department processes to improve systems of prehospital care. A study from 4 hospitals in Houston, TX, examined an integrated stroke system of care model.8 This included physician coverage shared across hospitals, nursing protocols, order sets, and centralized QI data collection. The objective of the program was to improve endovascular therapy for patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke at low-volume hospitals. The initiative successfully decreased interfacility transfers (46%–37%; P<0.05), median door-to-groin puncture time (111–89 minutes; P<0.0001), and median door-to-recanalization time (153–129 minutes; P<0.0001) but no change was observed in the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score. These data suggest that QI is possible at low-volume hospitals which enhances access to acute stroke services.Kapoor et al9 found that most patients at their large, academic medical center in Canada with suspected TIA or minor ischemic stroke had computed tomography (CT) of the head with outpatient carotid Dopplers. An electronic decision support tool for use by emergency department clinicians was implemented, to increase the use of CT angiography instead of noncontrast CT of the head. The multidisciplinary QI project successfully improved CT angiography in the emergency department (13.1%–65.9%; P<0.0001) among patients with high-risk events.A report from a single hospital in Melbourne, Australia, described a series of QI activities that targeted door-to-needle time including: changes in workflow, protocols, and augmented staffing.10 The direct-to-CT protocol and additional acute stroke nursing staffing were identified as keys to reducing door-to-needle times. This study also provides a reminder that it is not only imperative that hospitals seek to reduce mean door-to-needle times but that the variation across patients should also be minimized.A systems redesign approach (ie, process mapping, identification of failure modes, intervention development, action planning) was used successfully in one hospital in Connecticut to reduce emergency department length of stay (300–149 minutes; P<0.01) and improve interdisciplinary communication for patients requiring neurocritical care.11Implementation of a StrokeWatch at an academic stroke center in Germany provided a mechanism to measure key stroke-related procedures in real-time (ie, door-to-needle, door-to-groin, and door-to-recanalization).12 Although no significant differences in times were observed, this study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing real-time measurement and was helpful in identifying sources of delay (eg, intrahospital patient transport).In a tertiary care hospital in Japan, the development and implementation of a stroke code protocol and educational workshops resulted in decreased time from stroke recognition to neurologist assessment (91–35 minutes; P=0.002) and to neuroimaging (123–74 minutes; P=0.013), but no changes in thrombolysis or endovascular therapy were observed.13Acute Hospital Care QISeveral studies described in-hospital care QI initiatives including in Nova Scotia (Canada),14 Australia,15 and in single institutions in Denmark,16 and East Kent (United Kingdom).17 The studies varied in terms of the QI intervention; some were multifaceted,14 whereas others focused on a single QI strategy (eg, PDSA cycles,16,17 external facilitation15).For example, a Canadian report describes a 14-year effort to improve stroke care in the province of Nova Scotia which initially included 33 hospitals. The comprehensive QI program was multicomponent and multidisciplinary and included: identification of a stroke coordinator and physician champion who led local QI efforts, clustering stroke patients into inpatient stroke units, continuous data collection, audit-and-feedback, local development of QI plans based on gaps in care quality, education, interviews with stakeholders, and sharing of lessons learned.14 The hospitals implemented a broad range of QI activities including order sets, policies, and changes in work flow. From this QI program, an interim demonstration project indicated that the minimum patient-volume to maintain high quality of care was 115 patients per year in a ≥6-bed unit which led to an effort to consolidate care within geographic regions.14 In reflecting upon their experience, the authors attributed the many improvements in quality of care to the stroke physician and stroke coordinators who provided facilitation, knowledge brokering, and knowledge transfer.A study from 19 hospitals in Queensland (Australia) evaluated the effectiveness of external facilitation for stroke QI.15 Neither the amount nor type of external facilitation (eg, face-to-face, telephone, and email) was associated with development of a site-specific action plan or change in quality of care.PDSA cycles are commonly used in stroke QI projects. For example, they were used successfully to improve the proportion of stroke patients receiving glucose and cholesterol measurement on admission at a hospital in East Kent (United Kingdom).17 PDSA cycles were also used successfully to reduce the number of potentially avoidable night-time tasks in a Danish stroke unit.16 The project included education, knowledge sharing, checklists, and feedback over a period of 17 weeks and 5 PDSA cycles. The number of avoidable tasks for on-call junior doctors reduced from a median of 11 to a median of 3 per week.Posthospital Discharge Care QIFew studies evaluated QI initiatives to improve quality of stroke care following discharge from the acute in-patient stay (either in rehabilitation or primary care settings). A study from Germany sought to develop and pilot-test quality metrics that could be used in future studies to evaluate the possible benefits of poststroke neuropsychological therapy in the outpatient setting including a variety of domains (eg, involvement of relatives in the therapeutic process, standardized assessment of depression, time to initiating therapy, and counseling on fitness to drive).18QI Studies Spanning the Continuum of CareTwo articles reported content relevant to the entire continuum of stroke care. A systematic review of stroke QI collaboratives included 20 studies from 5 countries which included studies that spanned the continuum of care (eg, prehospital care, acute care, rehabilitation care, and primary care).19 QI collaboratives involve participants from different organizations (eg, different hospitals) joining together in QI-related activities over time.20–22 The greater the complexity of the collaborative intervention, the less likely it was to be effective; in contrast, interventions that focused on simple processes that were under control of the stroke team were more effective. The review described barriers of stroke QI collaboratives, such as structural changes during the intervention, lack of organizational support within the hospital for QI, insufficient resources and time to participate, as well as facilitators, including networking, feedback tools, and engagement by leaders.A systematic review of patient-reported experience measures of stroke care included 18 studies of 13 metrics (2 were stroke-specific and 11 were generic patient-reported experience measures).23 The existing measures either included many items and, therefore, had limited feasibility for implementation in routine practice or had not been validated in patients with stroke.Economic Evaluations of QITwo studies undertook economic evaluations of QI interventions and both found that implementation of QI programs was cost-effective. Ajmi et al24 reported on the cost-effectiveness of implementing a multifaceted QI project that included process mapping and redesign, engaging stakeholders, education, and simulation-based training at a large stroke center in Norway to improve thrombolysis care. The fixed costs of implementing the QI program was US$44 802 (2019 prices); the estimated costs per minute reduction in door-to-needle time per patient ranged from US$13 to US$29 and the estimated costs per death averted ranged from US$4679 to US$10 543; cost-effectiveness increased over time.Marquina et al25 constructed a decision analysis model to predict the cost-effectiveness of the Quality in Acute Stroke Care protocol which has been implemented 36 units in New South Wales (Australia). Over a 5-year period, implementation of the QI program nationwide was predicted to prevent 1154 deaths, gain 3180 quality-adjusted life-years, at an estimated net savings of Australian dollar 65.2 million in health care costs (AUD247 per stroke).ConclusionsIn 2021, the QI interventions targeted processes of stroke care across the continuum of care. Many interventions reviewed were successful and numerous effective programs were multicomponent and multidisciplinary. In the future, studies should include patients and caregivers in QI and evaluate interventions to improve care in the posthospital period.Article InformationSources of FundingM.F.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Prior approaches to identifying potentially avoidable hospital transfers (PAHs) of nursing home residents have involved detailed root cause analyses that are difficult to implement and sustain due to time and resource constraints. They relied on the presence of certain conditions but did not identify the specific issues that contributed to avoidability. We developed and tested an instrument that can be implemented using review of the electronic medical record. Research Design and Methods The OPTIMISTIC project was a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration to reduce avoidable hospital transfers of nursing home residents. The OPTIMISTIC team conducted a series of root cause analyses of transfer events, leading to development of a 27-item instrument to identify common characteristics of PAHs (Stage 1). To refine the instrument, project nurses used the electronic medical record (EMR) to score the avoidability of transfers to the hospital for 154 nursing home residents from 7 nursing homes from May 2019 through January 2020, including their overall impression of whether the transfer was avoidable (Stage 2). Each transfer was rated independently by 2 nurses and assessed for interrater reliability with a kappa statistic. Results Kappa scores ranged from −0.045 to 0.556. After removing items based on our criteria, 12 final items constituted the Avoidable Transfer Scale. To assess validity, we compared the 12-item scale to nurses’ overall judgment of avoidability of the transfer. The 12-item scale scores were significantly higher for submissions rated as avoidable than those rated unavoidable by the nurses (mean 5.3 vs 2.6, p &amp;lt; .001). Discussion and Implications The 12-item Avoidable Transfer Scale provides an efficient approach to identify and characterize PAHs using available data from the EMR. Increased ability to quantitatively assess the avoidability of resident transfers can aid nursing homes in quality improvement initiatives to treat more acute changes in a resident’s condition in place.

AB  - Abstract Background Despite high morbidity and mortality, patients with injection drug use associated infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) lack standardized care, and experience prolonged hospitalization and variable substance use disorder (SUD) management. Our study’s objective was to elicit perspectives of health care workers (HCWs) who deliver care to this population by understanding their perceived patient, provider, and system-level resources and barriers. Methods This qualitative study included interviews of HCWs providing care to patients with IDU-IE from January 2017 to December 2019 at a single Midwest academic center. Based on electronic medical record queries to determine high and low rates of referral to SUD treatment, HCWs were selected using stratified random sampling followed by convenience sampling of non-physician HCWs and a patient. Study participants were recruited via email and verbal consent was obtained. The final sample included 11 hospitalists, 3 specialists (including 2 cardiovascular surgery providers), 3 case managers, 2 social workers, 1 nurse, and 1 patient. Qualitative semi-structured interviews explored challenges and resources related to caring for this population. Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) Minor Lite was used for thematic data using an inductive approach. Results Three major thematic categories emerged relative to patient-level barriers (e.g., pain control, difficult patient interactions, social determinants of health), provider-level barriers (e.g., inequity, expectations for recovery, varying levels of hope, communication style, prescribing medication for SUD), and system-level barriers (e.g., repeat surgery, placement, resources for SUD and mental health). The need to address underlying SUD was a prominent theme. Conclusion Practical steps we can take to improve treatment for this population include training and coaching HCWs on a more person-centered approach to communication and transparent decision-making around pain management, surgery decisions, and expectations for SUD treatment.

AB  - To conduct a systematic review to identify studies that assessed the association between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients who took clopidogrel. We systematically searched Ovid EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science from November 1997 (inception) to September 2020. We included observational studies evaluating how CYP2C19 polymorphism is associated with clopidogrel’s effectiveness and safety among patients with PAD. We extracted relevant information details from eligible studies (e.g., study type, patient population, study outcomes). We used the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) Tool to assess the risk of bias for included observational studies. The outcomes of interest were the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel. The effectiveness outcomes included clinical ineffectiveness (e.g., restenosis). The safety outcomes included bleeding and death related to the use of clopidogrel. We identified four observational studies with a sample size ranging from 50 to 278. Outcomes and comparison groups of the studies varied. Three studies (75%) had an overall low risk of bias. All included studies demonstrated that carrying CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) alleles was significantly associated with reduced clinical effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel. Our systematic review showed an association between CYP2C19 LOF alleles and reduced functions of clopidogrel. The use of CYP2C19 testing in PAD patients prescribed clopidogrel may help improve the clinical outcomes. However, based on the limited evidence, there is a need for randomized clinical trials in PAD patients to test both the effectiveness and safety outcomes of clopidogrel.

AB  - In 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for GI Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference, entitled "Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes." The conference participants, which included more than 60 experts in colorectal cancer, considered recent improvements in colorectal cancer screening rates and polyp detection, persistent barriers to colonoscopy uptake, and opportunities for performance improvement and innovation. This white paper originates from that conference. It aims to summarize current patient- and physician-centered gaps and challenges in colonoscopy, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges affecting colonoscopy uptake, and the potential use of emerging technologies and quality metrics to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) arises from the ampulla of Vater where the pancreatic duct and bile duct join and empty into the duodenum. It can be classified into intestinal and pancreatobiliary types based on histopathology or immunohistochemistry. However, there are no biomarkers for further classification of pancreatobiliary-type AAC which has important implications for its treatment. We aimed to identify the tumor origin of pancreatobiliary-type AAC by systematically analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs), survival data, and genome sequencing data collected from multiple centers.This study involved three experiments. First, we extracted quantitative and highly interpretable features from the tumor region in WSIs and constructed a histologic classifier to differentiate between pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) and cholangiocarcinoma. The histologic classifier was then applied to patients with pancreatobiliary-type AAC to infer the tumor origin. Secondly, we compared the overall survival of patients with pancreatobiliary-type AAC stratified by the adjuvant chemotherapy regimens designed for PAC or cholangiocarcinoma. Finally, we compared the mutation landscape of pancreatobiliary-type AAC with those of PAC and cholangiocarcinoma.The histologic classifier accurately classified PAC and cholangiocarcinoma in both the internal and external validation sets (AUC > 0.99). All pancreatobiliary-type AACs (n = 45) were classified as PAC. The patients with pancreatobiliary-type AAC receiving regimens designed for PAC showed more favorable overall survival than those receiving regimens designed for cholangiocarcinoma in a multivariable Cox regression (hazard ratio = 7.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.28-40.78, P = 0.025). The results of mutation analysis showed that the mutation landscape of AAC was very similar to that of PAC but distinct from that of cholangiocarcinoma.This multi-center study provides compelling evidence that pancreatobiliary-type AAC resembles PAC instead of cholangiocarcinoma in different aspects, which can guide the treatment selection and clinical trials planning for pancreatobiliary-type AAC.

AB  - Abstract Background To evaluate quality improvement sustainment for Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and identify factors influencing sustainment, which is a challenge for Learning Healthcare Systems. Methods Mixed methods were used to assess changes in care quality across periods (baseline, implementation, sustainment) and identify factors promoting or hindering sustainment of care quality. PREVENT was a stepped-wedge trial at six US Department of Veterans Affairs implementation sites and 36 control sites (August 2015—September 2019). Quality of care was measured by the without-fail rate: proportion of TIA patients who received all of the care for which they were eligible among brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, neurology consultation, hypertension control, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antithrombotics, and high/moderate potency statins. Key informant interviews were used to identify factors associated with sustainment. Results The without-fail rate at PREVENT sites improved from 36.7% (baseline, 58/158) to 54.0% (implementation, 95/176) and settled at 48.3% (sustainment, 56/116). At control sites, the without-fail rate improved from 38.6% (baseline, 345/893) to 41.8% (implementation, 363/869) and remained at 43.0% (sustainment, 293/681). After adjustment, no statistically significant difference in sustainment quality between intervention and control sites was identified. Among PREVENT facilities, the without-fail rate improved ≥2% at 3 sites, declined ≥2% at two sites, and remained unchanged at one site during sustainment. Factors promoting sustainment were planning, motivation to sustain, integration of processes into routine practice, leadership engagement, and establishing systems for reflecting and evaluating on performance data. The only factor that was sufficient for improving quality of care during sustainment was the presence of a champion with plans for sustainment. Challenges during sustainment included competing demands, low volume, and potential problems with medical coding impairing use of performance data. Four factors were sufficient for declining quality of care during sustainment: low motivation, champion inactivity, no reflecting and evaluating on performance data, and absence of leadership engagement. Conclusions Although the intervention improved care quality during implementation; performance during sustainment was heterogeneous across intervention sites and not different from control sites. Learning Healthcare Systems seeking to sustain evidence-based practices should embed processes within routine care and establish systems for reviewing and reflecting upon performance.

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a common pain condition that often leads to significant disability. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of most medications for fibromyalgia is limited, and there is a need for alternative, non-pharmacological therapies. Yoga and aerobic exercise are both evidence-based non-pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia. However, no prior studies have directly compared the effectiveness of yoga vs. exercise.This article describes the study design and recruitment outcomes of the Pain Outcomes comparing Yoga vs. Structured Exercise (POYSE) Trial, a two-arm randomized comparative effectiveness trial.Veterans with fibromyalgia, defined by the 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria, who also experienced at least moderate pain severity were enrolled. The participants were randomized to a 12-week yoga-based or a structured exercise program (SEP) and will undergo comprehensive outcome assessments at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months by interviewers blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome will be the overall severity of fibromyalgia as measured by the total Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, pain beliefs, fatigue, sleep, and self-efficacy.A total of 2,671 recruitment letters were sent to potential participants with fibromyalgia. Of the potential participants, 623 (23.3%) were able to be contacted by telephone and had their eligibility assessed. Three hundred seventy-one of those interviewed were found to be eligible (59.6%) and 256 (69.0%) agreed to participate and were randomized to the YOGA (n = 129) or the SEP (n = 127) arm of the trial.Clinicians are faced with numerous challenges in treating patients with fibromyalgia. The interventions being tested in the POYSE trial have the potential to provide primary care and other care settings with new treatment options for clinicians while simultaneously providing a much needed relief for patients suffering from fibromyalgia.Funded by VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (D1100-R); Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01797263.

AB  - Abstract Background Fatigue is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom in cancer survivors. Although many measures have been developed to assess survivors’ fatigue, their ability to accurately capture change following intervention has rarely been assessed in post-treatment survivors. Ultra-brief fatigue measures are preferable in clinical practice but have limited evidence supporting their use with cancer survivors. We examined the psychometric properties of four Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) measures, including the new FSI-3, in cancer survivors. Examined properties included responsiveness to change and minimally important differences (MIDs). Methods We analyzed data from three randomized controlled trials with post-treatment cancer survivors ( N = 328). Responsiveness to change was evaluated by comparing standardized response means for survivors who reported their fatigue as being better, the same, or worse at 2–3 months. Responsiveness to intervention was assessed via effect sizes, and MIDs were estimated by using several methods. We also computed area under the curve (AUC) values to assess FSI measures’ discriminative accuracy compared to an established cut-point. Results All FSI measures differentiated survivors who reported improvement at 2–3 months from those with stable fatigue, but did not uniformly differentiate worsening fatigue from stable fatigue. Measures showed similar levels of responsiveness to intervention, and MIDs ranged from 0.29 to 2.20 across FSI measures. AUC analyses supported the measures’ ability to detect significant fatigue. Conclusions Four FSI scales show similar responsiveness to change, and estimated MIDs can inform assessment of meaningful change in fatigue. The FSI-3 shows promise as an ultra-brief fatigue measure for survivors.

AB  - There are known gender differences in both time spent on the electronic health record (EHR) and burnout. Previous studies have described potential benefits of staff support for documentation for physician experience and EHR time. It is not known, however, to what extent availability of staff support for documentation differs by gender in the context of primary care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care physicians (PCPs) using data from the 2018 and 2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey administrations. After descriptively analyzing the prevalence of staff support for documentation, we used multivariable logistic regression to identify the adjusted relationship of staff support for documentation with gender. RESULTS: Among the 813 physicians who endorsed having an EHR (92.5% of sample, representing 296,854 physicians), female PCPs were significantly less likely than male PCPs (25.1% vs 37.3%; P = .04) to report having staff support for documentation. This difference was most pronounced in practices with a single physician and practices with more than 50% of patients insured by Medicaid. Gender differences persisted in analyses adjusted for practice ownership and percent of patients insured by Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Given positive effects of documentation support and known gender differences in burnout and EHR use times, the differences identified have important implications for the physician workforce. Future research should focus on identifying underlying reasons and potential solutions for the gender differences described.

AB  - Given time constraints, poorly organized information, and complex patients, primary care providers (PCPs) can benefit from clinical decision support (CDS) tools that aggregate and synthesize problem-specific patient information. First, this article describes the design and functionality of a CDS tool for chronic noncancer pain in primary care. Second, we report on the retrospective analysis of real-world usage of the tool in the context of a pragmatic trial.The tool known as OneSheet was developed using user-centered principles and built in the Epic electronic health record (EHR) of 2 health systems. For each relevant patient, OneSheet presents pertinent information in a single EHR view to assist PCPs in completing guideline-recommended opioid risk mitigation tasks, review previous and current patient treatments, view patient-reported pain, physical function, and pain-related goals.Overall, 69 PCPs accessed OneSheet 2411 times (since November 2020). PCP use of OneSheet varied significantly by provider and was highly skewed (site 1: median accesses per provider: 17 [interquartile range (IQR) 9-32]; site 2: median: 8 [IQR 5-16]). Seven "power users" accounted for 70% of the overall access instances across both sites. OneSheet has been accessed an average of 20 times weekly between the 2 sites.Modest OneSheet use was observed relative to the number of eligible patients seen with chronic pain.Organizations implementing CDS tools are likely to see considerable provider-level variation in usage, suggesting that CDS tools may vary in their utility across PCPs, even for the same condition, because of differences in provider and care team workflows.

AB  - Background The number of oral anticancer medications has increased over the past few decades, opening new possibilities in cancer care and improving convenience for patients and caregivers. However, adherence levels continue to be suboptimal, potentially jeopardizing therapeutic benefits. Poor adherence levels may indicate gaps in current strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing medication adherence and the extent to which they address the complex and multi-faceted medication management needs of patients and their caregivers. Beyond commonly understood barriers (e.g., forgetting to take medications), adherence interventions must address systemic barriers that may not be fully appreciated by members of the healthcare system. This scoping review aims to apply a systems framework (human factors engineering framework) to examine system elements targeted by adherence enhancing interventions. Methods Studies published in English, reporting adherence interventions for oral anticancer medications with adherence and/or persistence as primary outcome measures will be included in this review. We will search the following electronic databases with no limits on dates: Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycInfo, and Scopus. Two reviewers will independently screen study titles and abstracts for inclusion with a third reviewer adjudicating conflicts. Full text of included articles will be used to extract information on systemic barriers targeted by adherence interventions as well as information about intervention type, outcomes, and study characteristics. Extracted information will be synthesized to generate a summary of work system factors targeted by adherence interventions. Discussion Through application of a systems-based approach, this scoping review is expected to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of factors influencing adherence to oral anticancer agents. The review may also identify areas that are ripe for further research.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether a secure, privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) methodology can be implemented in a scalable manner for use in a large national clinical research network. Results We established the governance and technical capacity to support the use of PPRL across the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet ® ). As a pilot, four sites used the Datavant software to transform patient personally identifiable information (PII) into de-identified tokens. We queried the sites for patients with a clinical encounter in 2018 or 2019 and matched their tokens to determine whether overlap existed. We described patient overlap among the sites and generated a “deduplicated” table of patient demographic characteristics. Overlapping patients were found in 3 of the 6 site-pairs. Following deduplication, the total patient count was 3,108,515 (0.11% reduction), with the largest reduction in count for patients with an “Other/Missing” value for Sex; from 198 to 163 (17.6% reduction). The PPRL solution successfully links patients across data sources using distributed queries without directly accessing patient PII. The overlap queries and analysis performed in this pilot is being replicated across the full network to provide additional insight into patient linkages among a distributed research network.

AB  - Abstract Objective We analyze observed reductions in physician note length and documentation time, 2 contributors to electronic health record (EHR) burden and burnout. Materials and Methods We used EHR metadata from January to May, 2021 for 130 079 ambulatory physician Epic users. We identified cohorts of physicians who decreased note length and/or documentation time and analyzed changes in their note composition. Results 37 857 physicians decreased either note length (n = 15 647), time in notes (n = 15 417), or both (n = 6793). Note length decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in copy/paste text (average relative change of –18.9%) and templated text (–17.2%). Note time decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in manual text (–27.3%) and increases in note content from other care team members (+21.1%). Discussion Organizations must consider priorities and tradeoffs in the distinct approaches needed to address different contributors to EHR burden. Conclusion Future research should explore scalable burden-reduction initiatives responsive to both note bloat and documentation time.

AB  - Abstract As many countries experience population aging, patients with cancer are becoming older and have more preexisting comorbidities, which include prevalent, age‐related, chronic conditions such as dementia. People living with dementia (PLWD) are vulnerable to health disparities, and dementia has high potential to complicate and adversely affect care and outcomes across the cancer trajectory. This report offers an overview of dementia and its prevalence among patients with cancer and a summary of the research literature examining cancer care for PLWD. The reviewed research indicates that PLWD are more likely to have cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage, receive no or less extensive cancer treatment, and have poorer survival after a cancer diagnosis. These cancer disparities do not necessarily signify inappropriately later diagnosis or lower treatment of people with dementia as a group, and they are arguably less feasible and appropriate targets for care optimization. The reviewed research indicates that PLWD also have an increased risk of cancer‐related emergency presentations, lower quality processes of cancer‐related decision making, accessibility‐related barriers to cancer investigations and treatment, higher experienced treatment burden and higher caregiver burden for families, and undertreated cancer‐related pain. The authors propose that optimal cancer care for PLWD should focus on proactively minimizing these risk areas and thus must be highly person‐centered, with holistic decision making, individualized reasonable adjustments to practice, and strong inclusion and support of family carers. Comprehensive recommendations are made for clinical practice and future research to help clinicians and providers deliver best and equitable cancer care for PLWD and their families.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination coverage remains lower in communities with higher social vulnerability. Factors such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure risk and access to healthcare are often correlated with social vulnerability and may therefore contribute to a relationship between vulnerability and observed vaccine effectiveness (VE). Understanding whether these factors impact VE could contribute to our understanding of real-world VE.We used electronic health record data from 7 health systems to assess vaccination coverage among patients with medically attended COVID-19-like illness. We then used a test-negative design to assess VE for 2- and 3-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) adult (≥18 years) vaccine recipients across Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) quartiles. SVI rankings were determined by geocoding patient addresses to census tracts; rankings were grouped into quartiles for analysis.In July 2021, primary series vaccination coverage was higher in the least vulnerable quartile than in the most vulnerable quartile (56% vs 36%, respectively). In February 2022, booster dose coverage among persons who had completed a primary series was higher in the least vulnerable quartile than in the most vulnerable quartile (43% vs 30%). VE among 2-dose and 3-dose recipients during the Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods of predominance was similar across SVI quartiles.COVID-19 vaccination coverage varied substantially by SVI. Differences in VE estimates by SVI were minimal across groups after adjusting for baseline patient factors. However, lower vaccination coverage among more socially vulnerable groups means that the burden of illness is still disproportionately borne by the most socially vulnerable populations.

AB  - Following historically low influenza activity during the 2020-2021 season, the United States saw an increase in influenza circulating during the 2021-2022 season. Most viruses belonged to the influenza A(H3N2) 3C.2a1b 2a.2 subclade.We conducted a test-negative case-control analysis among adults ≥18 years of age at 3 sites within the VISION Network. Encounters included emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits or hospitalizations with ≥1 acute respiratory illness (ARI) discharge diagnosis codes and molecular testing for influenza. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated by comparing the odds of influenza vaccination ≥14 days before the encounter date between influenza-positive cases (type A) and influenza-negative and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative controls, applying inverse probability-to-be-vaccinated weights, and adjusting for confounders.In total, 86 732 ED/UC ARI-associated encounters (7696 [9%] cases) and 16 805 hospitalized ARI-associated encounters (649 [4%] cases) were included. VE against influenza-associated ED/UC encounters was 25% (95% confidence interval (CI), 20%-29%) and 25% (95% CI, 11%-37%) against influenza-associated hospitalizations. VE against ED/UC encounters was lower in adults ≥65 years of age (7%; 95% CI, -5% to 17%) or with immunocompromising conditions (4%; 95% CI, -45% to 36%).During an influenza A(H3N2)-predominant influenza season, modest VE was observed. These findings highlight the need for improved vaccines, particularly for A(H3N2) viruses that are historically associated with lower VE.

AB  - Chemical sensors worn on the body could make possible the continuous, noninvasive, and accurate monitoring of vital human signals, which is necessary for remote health monitoring and telemedicine. Attractive for creating high-performance, wearable chemical sensors are atomically thin materials with intriguing physical features, abundant chemistry, and high surface-to-volume ratios. These advantages allow for appropriate material-analyte interactions, resulting in a high level of sensitivity even at trace analyte concentrations. Previous review articles covered the material and device elements of 2D material-based wearable devices extensively. In contrast, little research has addressed the existing state, future outlook, and promise of 2D materials for wearable chemical sensors. We provide an overview of recent advances in 2D-material-based wearable chemical sensors to overcome this deficiency. The structure design, manufacturing techniques, and mechanisms of 2D material-based wearable chemical sensors will be evaluated, as well as their applicability in human health monitoring. Importantly, we present a thorough review of the current state of the art and the technological gaps that would enable the future design and nanomanufacturing of 2D materials and wearable chemical sensors. Finally, we explore the challenges and opportunities associated with designing and implementing 2D wearable chemical sensors.

AB  - The impact of mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF) is not well established. We assessed the role of MR in patients enrolled in the Relaxin in Acute Heart Failure 2 (RELAX-AHF-2) trial.Patients enrolled in RELAX-AHF-2 with available data regarding MR status were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics, in-hospital data, and clinical outcomes through 180-day follow-up were evaluated. The impact of moderate/severe MR was assessed. Among 6420 AHF patients with known MR status, 1810 patients (28.2%) had moderate/severe MR. Compared to patients with no/mild MR, those with moderate/severe MR were more likely to have history of heart failure (HF), prior HF hospitalization, more comorbidities, symptoms/signs of HF, lower left ventricular ejection fraction and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Moderate/severe MR was associated with longer length of hospital stay, higher rates of residual dyspnoea, increased jugular venous pressure through the index hospitalization and a higher unadjusted risk of the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or rehospitalization for HF/renal failure (RF) through 180 days (crude hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.27, p = 0.01). The association between moderate/severe MR and poorer outcomes was not maintained in a multivariable model including several covariates of interest (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91-1.17, p = 0.65). Similar findings were observed for HF/RF rehospitalization alone.In patients with AHF, moderate/severe MR was associated with a worse clinical profile but did not have an independent prognostic impact on clinical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background POLST orders are actionable in an emergency, so it is important that the decisions be of high quality and concordant with current preferences. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between concordance and decision quality outcomes, including decision satisfaction and decisional conflict, among nursing facility residents and surrogates who recall POLST. Methods We completed structured interviews in 29 nursing facilities with 275 participants who had previously signed a POLST form. This included residents who were still making their own medical decisions ( n = 123) and surrogate decision‐makers for residents without decisional capacity ( n = 152). POLST recall was defined as remembering talking about and/or completing the POLST form previously signed by the participant. Concordance was determined by comparing preferences elicited during a standardized interview with the POLST form on file. Decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, and conversation quality were assessed with standardized tools. Results Half of participants (50%) remembered talking about or completing the POLST form, but recall was not associated with the length of time since POLST completion or concordance with existing preferences. In multivariable analyses, there was no association between POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes, though satisfaction was associated with conversation quality. Conclusions Half of the residents and surrogates in this study recalled the POLST they previously signed. Neither the age of the form nor the ability to recall the POLST conversation should be considered indicators of whether existing POLST orders match current preferences. Findings confirm a relationship between POLST conversation quality and satisfaction, underscoring the importance of POLST completion as a communication process.

AB  - Gathering information to adjudicate notifiable disease cases can be complex and time-consuming. Greater accessibility to electronic health record systems could improve disease investigation processes. We analyzed case information, comparing cases where the health department had access to an EHR system and those without such access. Completeness was significantly higher where EHR system access was available.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common among people with stroke. Anticoagulation medications can be used to manage the deleterious impact of AF after stroke, however, may not be prescribed due to concerns about post-stroke falls and decreased functioning. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify, among people with stroke and AF, predictors of anticoagulation prescription at hospital discharge.This is a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of data retrieved via medical records, including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor score (motor or physical function), ambulation on second day of hospitalization, Morse Falls Scale (fall risk) and HAS-BLED score (Hypertension; Abnormal renal and liver function; Stroke; Bleeding; Labile INRs; Elderly >65; and Drugs or alcohol). Data analyses included bivariate comparisons between people with and without anticoagulation at discharge. Logistic-regression modeling was used to assess predictors of discharge anticoagulation.There were 334 subjects included in the analyses, whose average age was 75 years old. Anticoagulation was prescribed at discharge for 235 (70%) of patients. In the adjusted regression analyses, only the FIM motor score (adjusted OR = 1.015, 95% CI 1.001-1.028) and the HAS-BLED score (adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.58) were significantly associated with anticoagulation prescription at discharge.It appears that in this sample, post-stroke anticoagulation decisions appear to be made based on clinical factors associated with bleed risk and motor deficits or physical functioning. However, opportunities may exist for improving clinician documentation of specific reasoning for non-anticoagulation prescription.

AB  - Provider reporting of notifiable disease is a critical component of public health assessment and surveillance. To efficiently and effectively assess and respond to disease, health departments require complete data from providers. To better understand the level of completeness in provider reporting, we examined key data elements across 7 notifiable diseases reported to a local health department. We found that some fields are incomplete more than half the time and provider demographics are frequently missing. We discuss the implications on public health workflow and opportunities for improvement.

AB  - We addressed two understudied issues in estimating lower extremity functional trajectories in older adults-incorporating the effect of mortality and evaluating heterogeneity among African Americans.Data were taken from the 998 participants in the African American Health cohort. A highly reliable and valid 8-item lower extremity function scale was used at baseline and at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 7-, and 9-year follow-up interviews. Semiparametric (ie, discrete) group-based mixture modeling identified the trajectories, and multinomial logistic regression identified risk factors for differential trajectory groups.When treating mortality as informative censoring, six discrete trajectories were observed with 45% of the participants belonging to three stable trajectories (good, fair, or poor function), and the remainder belonging to three declining trajectories (very high function with minimal improvement then minimal decline, very good function with a slow and modest decline, and very good function with a large and quick decline).Substantial heterogeneity in lower extremity function trajectories exists in the African American Health cohort, after appropriately treating mortality as informative censoring.

AB  - Automated detection methods can address delays and incompleteness in cancer case reporting. Existing automated efforts are largely dependent on complex dictionaries and coded data. Using a gold standard of manually reviewed pathology reports, we evaluated the performance of alternative input formats and decision models on a convenience sample of free-text pathology reports. Results showed that the input format significantly impacted performance, and specific algorithms yielded better results for presicion, recall and accuracy. We conclude that our approach is sufficiently accurate for practical purposes and represents a generalized process.

AB  - Current approaches for capacity building in Health Informatics (HI) in developing countries mostly focus on training, and often rely on support from foreign entities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive and multidimensional capacity-building framework by Lansang &amp; Dennis, and its application for HI capacity building as implemented in a higher-education institution in Kenya. This framework incorporates training, learning-by-doing, partnerships, and centers of excellence. At Moi University (Kenya), the training dimensions include an accredited Masters in HI Program, PhD in HI, and HI short courses. Learning-by-doing occurs through work within MOH facilities at the AMPATH care and treatment program serving 3 million people. Moi University has formed strategic HI partnerships with Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (USA), University of Bergen (Norway), and Makerere University (Uganda), among others. The University has also created an Institute of Biomedical Informatics to serve as an HI Center of Excellence in the region. This Institute has divisions in Training, Research, Service and Administration. The HI capacity-building approach by Moi provides a model for adoption by other institutions in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Centrality of pain refers to the degree to which a patient views chronic pain as integral to his or her life or identity. The purpose of this study was to gain a richer understanding of pain centrality from the perspective of patients who live with chronic pain.Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 26 Veterans with chronic and disabling musculoskeletal pain after completing a stepped care intervention within a randomized controlled trial. Qualitative data were analyzed using an immersion/crystallization approach. We evaluated the role centrality plays in Veterans’ lives and examined whether and how their narratives differ when centrality either significantly decreases or increases after participation in a stepped care intervention for chronic pain.Our data identified three emergent themes that characterized pain centrality: 1) control, 2) acceptance, and 3) preoccupation. We identified five characteristics that distinguished patients’ changes in centrality from baseline: 1) biopsychosocial viewpoint, 2) activity level, 3) pain communication, 4) participation in managing own pain, and 5) social support.This study highlights centrality of pain as an important construct to consider within the overall patient experience of chronic pain.

AB  - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines transitions of care as “movement of a patient from one setting of care (hospital, primary care practice, specialty care practice, long-term care, home health, rehabilitation facility) to another.”1 Among these transitions, one from the hospital back to the community has garnered much attention for various reasons, including but not limited to acute hospitalization being a major event, complexity of needs and care during the hospitalization, multiple possible transition points during one hospitalization, and limited hospital and community resources leading to insufficient coordination across the hospital and the community care providers.2-4 In 2012, a CMS report found that every fifth hospitalization of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged alive was associated with a readmission within 30 days of the index admission.5 The inappropriate rehospitalizations and other adverse postdischarge events originating from inadequate transitional care cost the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $12 billion-$44 billion annually.6 In this issue of the Journal of American Geriatrics Society, Le Berre and colleagues present the results of a systematic evidence review (SER) to determine the efficacy of transitional care interventions in reducing the burden related to fragmented transitional care from hospital to home.7 The authors selected meaningful outcomes for patients and healthcare policy-makers, including overall mortality, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions. The authors should be commended on conducting a SER study with high internal and external validity. They followed the Cochrane recommendations and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials were included, and the population, interventions, and outcomes were well delineated. The Le Berre SER study confirms that well-designed transitional care services can reduce mortality and acute care resource use.7 The remaining crucial challenge of reducing transitional care–related burden is successful, sustainable, and scalable implementation of the evidence-based minimally specified components of transitional care services. How do we deliver the essential components of effective transitional care services within a fragmented healthcare system? In this era of fragmented care, older adults with multiple chronic conditions are particularly vulnerable, especially if one of the chronic conditions is cognitive impairment. Multiple programs frequently provide transitional care services within a single system, and in many cases, these programs are unaware of the competing services. Each program brings valuable specialized knowledge to the transition process, but no single program is equipped to assume responsibility for the entire system. The ensuing duplication of effort results in incomplete or diluted transitional care services and additional burden and confusion for patients. To maximize efficiency and effectiveness, delivery of transitional care services must be consolidated within a single distribution system that can operate within the broader context of the patient's comprehensive plan of care, including the postdischarge care plan. By expanding the workforce to include a diverse group of health professionals with specialized training in care management for a variety of chronic conditions, home health agencies can provide around-the-clock availability, pharmacy involvement, and continuity of care designed to match each patient's unique needs. This personalized approach offers an opportunity to partner with the patient (and if appropriate, his or her informal caregivers) throughout the process. Such a model offers the best hope of improving the quality of life of the patient and simultaneously reducing mortality and resource use. Conflict of Interest: None.

AB  - Personal health records available to patients today suffer from multiple limitations, such as information fragmentation, a one-size-fits-all approach and a focus on data gathered over time and by institution rather than health conditions. This makes it difficult for patients to effectively manage their health, for these data to be enriched with relevant information from external sources and for clinicians to support them in that endeavor. We propose a novel conceptual architecture for person-centered health record information systems that transcends many of these limitations and capitalizes on the emerging trend of socially-driven information systems. Our proposed personal health record system is personalized on demand to the conditions of each individual patient; organized to facilitate the tracking and review of the patient's conditions; and able to support patient-community interactions, thereby promoting community engagement in scientific studies, facilitating preventive medicine, and accelerating the translation of research findings.

AB  - Despite laws that require reporting of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to governmental health agencies, integrated surveillance of STDs remains challenging. Data and information about testing are fragmented from information on treatment and outcomes. To overcome this fragmentation, data from multiple electronic systems spanning clinical and public health environments were integrated to create an STD surveillance registry. Electronic health records, disease case records, and birth registry records were linked and then stored in a de-identified, secure server for use by health officials and researchers. The registry contains nearly 6 million tests for 628,138 individuals over a 12-year period. The registry supports efforts to understand the epidemiology of STDs as well as health services and outcomes for those diagnosed with STDs. Specialized disease registries hold promise for collaboration across clinical and public health domains to improve surveillance efforts, reduce health disparities, and increase prevention efforts at the local level.

AB  - Chronic care coordination efforts often focus on the needs of the healthcare team and not on the individual needs of each patient. However, developing a personalized care plan for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requires individual patient engagement with the health care team. We describe the development of a CKD e-care plan that focuses on patient specific needs and life goals, and can be personalized according to provider needs.

AB  - Objective: When a patient cannot make medical decisions for him or herself, and has not appointed a healthcare representative, default state healthcare consent laws determine who is able to make healthcare decisions for the patient. The narrow construction of some state laws leaves many patients in situations where the closest person to the patient does not qualify as a representative under the law, or where the patient has too many representatives and a consensus cannot be reached on the patient’s medical care.Methods: In order to determine how state healthcare consent laws affect patient care in hospitals, a survey of 412 Indiana physicians was conducted.Results: The data shows 53.8% of physicians experienced a delay in patient care because they were unable to identify a legally appropriate health care representative. Almost half (46.01%) of physicians experienced delay of patient care due to the inability to identify a final decision maker when disputes arose between multiple legal representatives.Conclusions: The results of this study have important implications for hospital administrators as a delay in patient care can be costly and unnecessarily utilizes hospital resources. Additionally, the results of this study have important implications for the status of state surrogate decision making laws. Amending state laws to include more potential surrogates, has the potential to minimize delays in patient care and ensure that appropriate surrogates are making medical care decisions for patients without the undue burden of court intervention.

AB  - Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution increases disease risk in older adults. Nursing facilities located near major roadways potentially expose older adults to traffic pollution. No studies, however, have described the association between nursing facilities and traffic pollution. We obtained data on facility- and census-tract-level characteristics of 15,706 U.S. facilities from the Medicare Nursing Home Compare datasets. We calculated distance to major roadways and traffic density for each facility. In the contiguous U.S. (as of 2014), 345,792 older adults, about 27% of residents in non-hospital facilities, lived within 150 m major roadways (A1 or A2) in 3876 (28% of sampled) facilities. Nationally, for-profit facilities, high-occupancy facilities, and facilities in census tracts with higher percentages of minorities were more likely to have higher exposure to traffic. Counties in Virginia, New York City, and Rhode Island have the highest percent of residents and facilities near major roads. Nationally, over one-quarter of sampled facilities are located near major roadways. Attributes potentially associated with higher exposure to traffic included “for-profit” and “higher minority census tract”. Proximity to major roadways may be an important factor to consider in siting nursing facilities. Our results inform potential intervention strategy at both county and facility level.

AB  - Adolescents who face life-limiting illness have unique developmental features and strong personal preferences around end of life (EOL) care. Understanding and documenting those preferences can be enhanced by practising narrative medicine. This paper aims to identify a new form of narrative, the Adolescent End of Life Narrative, and recognise four central themes. The Adolescent EOL Narrative can be observed in young adult fiction, The Fault in Our Stars , which elucidates the notion that terminally ill adolescents have authentic preferences about their life and death. Attaining narrative competence and appreciating the distinct perspective of the dying adolescent allows medical providers and parents to support the adolescent in achieving a good death. By thinking with the Adolescent EOL Narrative, adults can use Voicing my CHOiCES, an EOL planning guide designed for adolescents, to effectively capture the adolescent’s preferences, and the adolescent can make use of this type of narrative to make sense of their lived experience.

AB  - Quality metrics and technological advances for colonoscopy are contributing to detection of more diminutive and small adenomas, increasing the proportion of persons undergoing surveillance for non-advanced neoplasia. In this issue, Kim and colleagues report surveillance colonoscopy findings in average-risk Koreans who had one or more adenomas on a first screening colonoscopy and found a similar risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia between those with 1-2 non-advanced adenoma (the "low-risk adenoma" group) and those with 3 or more small adenomas. The validity, generalizability, and clinical implications of the findings are considered along with recent similar studies. In sum, these studies support expanding the low-risk subgroup to include up to four diminutive tubular adenomas and perhaps persons with up to four small tubular adenomas. They also prompt consideration of "precision surveillance" that considers features of not just the polyps, but of the patient and endoscopist.

AB  - Critically ill adult patients who face medical decisions often delegate others to make important decisions. Those who are authorized to make such decisions are typically family members, friends, or legally authorized representatives, often referred to as surrogates. Making medical decisions on behalf of others produces emotional distress. Spirituality and/or religion provide significant assistance to cope with this distress. We designed this study to assess the role of surrogates' spirituality and religion (S/R) coping resources during and after making medical decisions on behalf of critically ill patients. The study's aim was to understand the role that S/R resources play in coping with the lived experiences and challenges of being a surrogate.Semistructured interviews were conducted with 46 surrogates by trained interviewers. These were audio-recorded and transcribed by research staff. Three investigators conducted a thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews. The codes from inter-rater findings were analyzed, and comparisons were made to ensure consistency.The majority (67%) of surrogates endorsed belief in God and a personal practice of religion. Five themes emerged in this study. Personal prayer was demonstrated as the most important coping resource among surrogates who were religious. Trusting in God to be in charge or to provide guidance was also commonly expressed. Supportive relationships from family, friends, and coworkers emerged as a coping resource for all surrogates. Religious and nonreligious surrogates endorsed coping strategies such as painting, coloring, silent reflection, music, recreation, and reading. Some surrogates also shared personal experiences that were transformative as they cared for their ill patients.We conclude that surrogates use several S/R and other resources to cope with stress when making decisions for critically ill adult patients. The coping resources identified in this study may guide professional chaplains and other care providers to design a patient-based and outcome-oriented intervention to reduce surrogate stress, improve communication, increase patient and surrogate satisfaction, and increase surrogate integration in patient care. We recommend ensuring that surrogates have S/R resources actively engaged in making medical decisions. Chaplains should be involved before, during, and after medical decision making to assess and address surrogate stress. An interventional research-design project to assess the effect of spiritual care on surrogate coping before, during, and after medical decision making is also recommended.

AB  - Background Smoking is an established risk factor for oral diseases and, therefore, dental clinicians routinely assess and record their patients' detailed smoking status. Researchers have successfully extracted smoking history from electronic health records (EHRs) using text mining methods. However, they could not retrieve patients' smoking intensity due to its limited availability in the EHR. The presence of detailed smoking information in the electronic dental record (EDR) often under a separate section allows retrieving this information with less preprocessing. Objective To determine patients' detailed smoking status based on smoking intensity from the EDR. Methods First, the authors created a reference standard of 3,296 unique patients’ smoking histories from the EDR that classified patients based on their smoking intensity. Next, they trained three machine learning classifiers (support vector machine, random forest, and naive Bayes) using the training set (2,176) and evaluated performances on test set (1,120) using precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F). Finally, they applied the best classifier to classify smoking status from an additional 3,114 patients’ smoking histories. Results Support vector machine performed best to classify patients into smokers, nonsmokers, and unknowns (P, R, F: 98%); intermittent smoker (P: 95%, R: 98%, F: 96%); past smoker (P, R, F: 89%); light smoker (P, R, F: 87%); smokers with unknown intensity (P: 76%, R: 86%, F: 81%), and intermediate smoker (P: 90%, R: 88%, F: 89%). It performed moderately to differentiate heavy smokers (P: 90%, R: 44%, F: 60%). EDR could be a valuable source for obtaining patients’ detailed smoking information. Conclusion EDR data could serve as a valuable source for obtaining patients' detailed smoking information based on their smoking intensity that may not be readily available in the EHR.

AB  - Medications may lessen core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet families continue to report stress and have a low quality of life. Primary care providers manage almost half of all children with ADHD but do not have a brief measure to assess ADHD impacts on family in the context of everyday family life. The IMPACT (Impact Measure of Parenting-Related ADHD Challenges and Treatment) 1.0 Scale was codeveloped with input from parent advisors and administered to 79 parents of children with ADHD. Exploratory factor analysis, correlations with validated instruments, and test-retest reliability were examined. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in 4 subscales (Misbehavior, Siblings, Time, School), which demonstrated moderate to high test-retest reliability. Scale domains were related to severity and change in ADHD symptoms. Significant correlations were found between IMPACT scores, adaptive functioning in the home, and ADHD-related quality of life. The IMPACT 1.0 Scale provides a novel, reliable, and valid method to assess family impact of ADHD.

AB  - New models of care seek to reorganize healthcare to meet the challenges of a growing number of persons with chronic conditions, to optimize the use of the available workforce, and to improve the quality of care. Increasingly, these models also seek to organize care in a manner that addresses cost and efficiency in addition to quality of care. This chapter first revisits the history of chronic care models and then provides a description of successful and sustainable examples of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches for persons with dementia, persons with Parkinson's disease, and the frail elderly. We focus on models for neurodegenerative diseases and draw from the perspectives of research, clinical practice, and informal caregiving. Although focused on neurodegenerative disease, the principles of these approaches reflect the hallmarks of good primary, geriatric, and collaborative care. Many of the current models of care emanate from a medical approach led by physicians and other professional providers within the formal healthcare setting. Innovative approaches, however, now seek to incorporate these medical models within social and community services. We conclude this chapter by describing several international examples of community-based efforts that have been implemented to improve the care and lives of patients with dementia and their informal caregivers, which is at present one of the top priorities in many countries.

AB  - Although tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute ischemic stroke, there is no consensus about the need for informed consent for its use. As a result, hospitals throughout the U.S. have varying requirements regarding obtaining informed consent from patients for the use of tPA, ranging from no requirement for informed consent to a requirement for verbal or written informed consent. We conducted a study to (1) determine current beliefs about obtaining patients' informed consent for tPA among a large group of stroke clinicians and (2) identify the ethical, clinical, and organizational factors that influence tPA consent practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by trained and experienced investigators and research staff to identify key barriers to implementing acute stroke services. Part of the interview explored current beliefs and practices around informed consent for tPA. This was a multicenter study that included 38 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospital locations. Participants were 68 stroke team clinicians, serving primarily on the neurology (35 percent) or emergency medicine (41 percent) service. We conducted thematic analysis based on principles of grounded theory to identify codes about consent for tPA. We used interpretive convergence to ensure consistency among the individual investigators' codes and to ensure that all of the investigators agreed on coding and themes. We found that 38 percent of the stroke clinicians did not believe any form of consent was necessary for tPA, 47 percent thought that some form of consent was necessary, and 15 percent were unsure. Clinicians who believed tPA required informed consent were divided on whether consent should be written (40 percent) or verbal (60 percent). We identified three factors describing clinicians' attitudes about consent: (1) legal and policy factors, (2) ethical factors, and (3) medical factors. The lack of consensus regarding consent for tPA creates the potential for delays in treatment, uneasiness among clinicians, and legal liability. The identified factors provide a potential framework to guide discussions about developing a standard of care for acquiring the informed consent of patients for the administration of tPA.

AB  - Background In-hospital respiratory outcomes of non-surgical patients with undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), particularly those with significant comorbidities are not well defined. Undiagnosed and untreated OSA may be associated with increased cardiopulmonary morbidity. Study objectives Evaluate respiratory failure outcomes in patients identified as at-risk for OSA by the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ). Methods This was a retrospective study conducted using electronic health records at a large health system. The BQ was administered at admission to screen for OSA to medical-service patients under the age of 80 years old meeting the following health system criteria: (1) BMI greater than 30; (2) any of the following comorbid diagnoses: hypertension, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular event/stroke, or diabetes. Patients with known OSA or undergoing surgery were excluded. Patients were classified as high-risk or low-risk for OSA based on the BQ score as follows: low-risk (0 or 1 category with a positive score on the BQ); high-risk (2 or more categories with a positive score on BQ). The primary outcome was respiratory failure during index hospital stay defined by any of the following: orders for conventional ventilation or intubation; at least two instances of oxygen saturation less than 88% by pulse oximetry; at least two instances of respiratory rate over 30 breaths per minute; and any orders placed for non-invasive mechanical ventilation without a previous diagnosis of sleep apnea. Propensity scores were used to control for patient characteristics. Results Records of 15,253 patients were assessed. There were no significant differences in the composite outcome of respiratory failure by risk of OSA (high risk: 11%, low risk: 10%, p = 0.55). When respiratory failure was defined as need for ventilation, more patients in the low-risk group experienced invasive mechanical ventilation (high-risk: 1.8% vs. low-risk: 2.3%, p = 0.041). Mortality was decreased in patients at high-risk for OSA (0.86%) vs. low risk for OSA (1.53%, p < 0.001). Conclusions Further prospective studies are needed to understand the contribution of undiagnosed OSA to in-hospital respiratory outcomes.

AB  - Background The effect of delirium on physical function in patients undergoing noncardiac thoracic surgery has not been well described and may differ from that in other surgical populations. Objective To determine the effects of delirium on muscle strength and functional independence. The primary end point was change in Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-SS) by delirium status. Methods A secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial involving English-speaking adults aged 18 years or older who were undergoing major noncardiac thoracic surgery. Exclusion criteria were history of schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, dementia, alcohol abuse, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome; haloperidol allergy; being pregnant or nursing; QT prolongation; and taking levodopa or cholinesterase inhibitors. Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Preoperatively and postoperatively, muscle strength was assessed using the modified MRC-SS and functional independence was assessed using the Katz scale of activities of daily living. Changes in MRC-SS and Katz score by delirium status were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Results Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis. Median (interquartile range) MRC-SS and Katz score before surgery did not differ significantly between patients without and with delirium (MRC-SS: 30 [30-30] vs 30 [30-30], P &amp;gt; .99; Katz score: 6 [6-6] vs 6 [6-6], P = .63). The percentage of patients with a change in MRC-SS was similar in patients without and with delirium (17% vs 13%, respectively; P &amp;gt; .99). More patients in the delirium group had a change in Katz score (13% vs 0%, P = .04). Conclusions Postoperative delirium was not associated with change in muscle strength. Follow-up studies using other muscle measures may be needed.

AB  - The ability to understand and measure the complexity of clinical workflow provides hospital managers and researchers with the necessary knowledge to assess some of the most critical issues in healthcare. Given the protagonist role of workflow time studies on influencing decision makers, major efforts are being conducted to address existing methodological inconsistencies of the technique. Among major concerns, the lack of a standardized methodology to ensure the reliability of human observers stands as a priority. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of the current Inter-Observer Reliability Assessments, and propose a novel composite score to systematically conduct them. The composite score is composed of a) the overall agreement based on Kappa that evaluates the naming agreement on virtually created one-seconds tasks, providing a global assessment of the agreement over time, b) a naming agreement based on Kappa, requiring an observation pairing approach based on time-overlap, c) a duration agreement based on the concordance correlation coefficient, that provides means to evaluate the correlation concerning tasks duration, d) a timing agreement, based on descriptive statistics of the gaps between timestamps of same-task classes, and e) a sequence agreement based on the Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment algorithm. We hereby provide a first step towards standardized reliability reporting in workflow time studies. This new composite IORA protocol is intended to empower workflow researchers with a standardized and comprehensive method for validating observers' reliability and, in turn, the validity of their data and results.

AB  - Purpose Open source software (OSS) communities devoted to the development of electronic medical records (EMRs) have grown in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the challenge the leaders of these communities face in terms of building perceptions of psychological ownership among community members. Design/methodology/approach Surveys ( n = 50) and brief interviews ( n = 56) with individual members of an open source EMR community (most of whom are based in African nations) were used. Findings Among community members, normative commitment (in comparison to extrinsic motivation and affective commitment) was the strongest predictor of psychological ownership. Interviews revealed that community members tended to feel a greater sense of ownership toward the end user (i.e. hospitals and clinics) than toward the community itself. Practical implications To foster engagement and retention – and enhance the worldwide impact of their community on healthcare practices – leaders of open source EMR communities can offer incentives related to certifications and status-based rewards, hold annual meetings to allow members to develop a better understanding of the community and encourage members to “pay it forward” by involving end users (i.e. hospital and clinic employees) within the community, thus furthering public health initiatives. Originality/value OSS communities experience unique challenges compared to traditional organizations. This necessitates a reconsideration of the applicability of commonly accepted principles, tenets and recommendations from the management literature.

AB  - The National Institute on Aging IM bedded P ragmatic A lzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease–Related Dementias C linical T rials (IMPACT) Collaboratory serves as a national resource for the conduct of embedded pragmatic clinical trials to improve the care of people living with dementia (PLWD) in partnership with the healthcare systems that serve them. Inherent in this objective is the need to train and support a cadre of investigators prepared to conduct this work now and in the future. The Training Core of the IMPACT Collaboratory supports the training of investigators to become experts in this field through three objectives: (1) curricula development and dissemination; (2) network generation and navigation; and (3) a career development award program. The innovative approach of the Training Core will require developing content and providing training experiences that recognize the unique challenges of research at the intersection of health systems, pragmatic trials, and PLWD and their caregivers. Ultimately, we seek to build the nation's capacity to conduct research that bridges the gaps between efficacy studies to effectiveness research to implementation science. Although foundational resources in the methods of each of these areas are already available, few actually focus on pragmatic trials embedded within healthcare systems that focus on PLWD. To bring new interventions for PLWD from efficacy to widespread implementation, researchers must build diffusability, adaptability, heterogeneity, and scalability into the design of the intervention. In achieving these objectives, the Training Core will utilize the network of investigators, institutions, and stakeholders represented in the IMPACT Collaboratory.

AB  - Health outcomes for complex older adults are enhanced by interprofessional collaboration. Funded by a Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP), an interprofessional team of educators developed a short-term geriatrics experience, including four hours of pre-clinical education and 12-20 hours of immersion in team-based care for advanced learners in nursing (n = 70 APN), social work (n = 48 MSW), and medicine (n = 122 medical students). Content focused on five areas: medication management, dementia, depression, falls, and myths about aging. Learners completed pre/post surveys measuring knowledge of geriatrics, attitudes toward geriatric patients and team care, and post-surveys regarding perceptions of the overall clinical experience. Results showed significant improvement in knowledge and attitudes toward older adults and interprofessional (IP) team practice. Qualitative comments reflected increased empathy toward and enthusiasm for working with older adults, valuing IP teams, and a desire for geriatrics content earlier in their respective curricula.

AB  - ICU is a multifaceted organization where multiple teams care for critically ill patients. In the current era, collaboration between teams and efficient workflows form the backbone of value-based care. Geographical cohorting is a widespread model for hospitalist rounding, but its role in ICUs is unclear. This study evaluates the outcomes of geographical cohorting in a large ICU of an Academic Health Center.This is a retrospective analysis of quality metrics collected 12 months pre- and post-implementation of geographical cohorting.A total of 130 bedded ICU at tertiary academic health center in Midwest.All patients admitted to the ICU.Our institution piloted the geographical cohorting model for critical care physician rounding on September 1, 2018.The quality metrics were categorized as ICU harm events and ICU hospital metrics. Team of critical care providers were surveyed 12 months after implementation.The critical care utilization in the pre- and post-implementation numbers were similar for patient days (pre = 34,839, post = 35,155), central-line days (pre = 17,648, post = 19,224), and Foley catheter days (pre = 18,292, post = 17,364). The ICU length of stay was similar (4.9 d) in both pre- and post-intervention periods. Significant reduction in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (relative risk, -0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-0.96; p = 0.039), hospital-acquired pressure injury (relative risk, -0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92; p = 0.020), central line-associated bloodstream infection incidence (relative risk, -0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.52; p = 0.008), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (relative risk, -0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93; p = 0.027). Healthcare providers perceived optimal utilization of their time, reduced interruptions, and improved coordination of care with geographical rounding.Geographical cohorting improves coordination of care, physician workflow, and critical care quality metrics in very large ICUs.

AB  - Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly experience dyspnea, which may limit activities of daily living. Pursed-lip breathing improves dyspnea for COPD patients; however, access to pursed-lip breathing training is limited.The proposed MELodica Orchestra for DYspnea (MELODY) study will be a single-site pilot study to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a music-based approach to teach pursed-lip breathing. Patients with COPD and moderate-severe dyspnea are randomized to intervention, education-control, or usual care control groups. Intervention patients meet twice weekly for eight weeks for melodica instruction, group music-making, and COPD education. Safety, feasibility, and efficacy is assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.This manuscript describes the rationale and methods of the MELODY pilot project.If pilot data demonstrate efficacy, then a multi-site randomized control trial will be conducted to evaluate program effectiveness and implementation.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis: &#x0D; Atypical diabetes (DM) comprises phenotypically and potentially genotypically distinct forms of DM not fitting current sub-categories of classification. Understanding these rare and uncharacterized types of DM can potentially inform the application of personalized therapeutic approaches and is the emphasis of a recent NIH-funded Consortium focused on Rare and Atypical Diabetes (RADIANT). We aimed to employ informatic-based algorithms to identify potentially atypical DM cases from electronic medical records (EMR) to identify candidates for inclusion in RADIANT. &#x0D; &#x0D; Project Methods: &#x0D; Diabetic patients were identified based on two DM diagnostic codes, treatment with anti-diabetic medication, and two diagnostic labs elevated. We filtered for patients with BMI &lt;25 at diagnosis and normal lipid profile. Charts were reviewed manually. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from EMR and entered into a REDCap database. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. &#x0D; &#x0D; Results: &#x0D; A total of 21,820 individuals met criteria for DM; 208 were identified as potentially atypical. Chart review was completed for 126 cases. Fifteen were deceased and removed from the final cohort. Of those remaining, 12 (11%) exhibited features consistent with atypical diabetes. The remainder were classified as typical T2D. No significant differences regarding ethnicity or diabetes complication status were identified between typical and atypical cases. Demographics of atypical cases were, 66% female, and 33% male. The average age of diagnosis was 46.8 ± 19.3 yrs. Average BMI was 23.7 ± 4.1. Atypical diabetes individuals were more likely to present with ketoacidosis (p=0.01) exhibiting a trend towards increased insulin use (50% vs. 14%; p=0.09). &#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion: &#x0D; Our study suggests that using EMR may be effective in flagging phenotypically distinct forms of DM in real world settings, associated with a high false positive rate. Data suggests this form of atypical diabetes represents a small percentage of overall DM cases (0.05%). Future studies will focus on application of algorithms to identify other atypical diabetes subsets.

AB  - With the rapid development of new advanced molecular detection methods, identification of new genetic mutations conferring pathogen resistance to an ever-growing variety of antimicrobial substances will generate massive genomic datasets for public health and clinical laboratories. Keeping up with specialized standard coding for these immense datasets will be extremely challenging. This challenge prompted our effort to create a common molecular resistance Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) panel that can be used to report any identified antimicrobial resistance pattern.To develop and utilize a common molecular resistance LOINC panel for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) data exchange in the U.S. National Tuberculosis Surveillance System using California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and New York State Department of Health as pilot sites.We developed an interface and mapped incoming molecular DST data to the common molecular resistance LOINC panel using Health Level Seven (HL7) v2.5.1 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) message specifications through the Orion Health™ Rhapsody Integration Engine v6.3.1.Both pilot sites were able to process and upload/import the standardized HL7 v2.5.1 ELR messages into their respective systems; albeit CDPH identified areas for system improvements and has focused efforts to streamline the message importation process. Specifically, CDPH is enhancing their system to better capture parent-child elements and ensure that the data collected can be accessed seamlessly by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The common molecular resistance LOINC panel is designed to be generalizable across other resistance genes and ideally also applicable to other disease domains.The study demonstrates that it is possible to exchange molecular DST data across the continuum of disparate healthcare information systems in integrated public health environments using the common molecular resistance LOINC panel.

AB  - Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is among the most prevalent symptoms in cancer survivors and often co-occurs with other symptoms. However, little is known about survivors' preferences for treating CRF and associated symptoms.The aim of this study was to examine cancer survivors' interest in learning skills to manage CRF and associated symptoms and their interest in various nonpharmacologic interventions and modalities. These outcomes were compared between survivors with high and normal fatigue.Breast, gastrointestinal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors (N = 338) completed a 1-time survey, including a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System fatigue measure and a checklist assessing interest in learning skills to manage CRF and associated symptoms as well as interest in nonpharmacologic interventions and modalities.Many cancer survivors reported interest in learning skills to manage CRF (range, 35%-78%) and associated symptoms (range, 13%-48%). Compared with survivors with normal fatigue (n = 180), highly fatigued survivors (n = 158; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System fatigue T score ≥ 55) were more likely to report interest in learning skills to manage various symptoms, self-compassion training, and programs offered individually and in person. Interest in other interventions and modalities did not vary by fatigue level.Many cancer survivors, especially those with high fatigue, report interest in learning symptom management skills. Given survivors' high level of interest in complementary and integrative health interventions, future research should continue to assess their impact on symptoms and functioning.Nurses can offer a menu of evidence-based options for symptom management, given survivors' diverse preferences. Nurses can also provide psychoeducation regarding their preferred treatments.

Fuchs C.S. et al.Cancer susceptibility gene mutations in individuals with colorectal cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2017; 35: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar Inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, LS is caused by pathogenic germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 and by deletions in EPCAM. Loss of expression of MMR proteins causes defective DNA mismatch repair, leading to changes in the length of nucleotide repeat sequences or microsatellite instability (MSI).3Grady W.M. Carethers J.M.

Ingram M.A. Silver E.R. et al.Gene-specific variation in colorectal cancer surveillance strategies for Lynch syndrome.Gastroenterology. 2021; 161: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar A cohort of 25-year-olds were cycled annually until age 75 years or death. The researchers varied surveillance initiation between ages 25 and 40 years and surveillance intervals ranging from 1 to 5 years, resulting in a total of 20 strategies for each gene-specific scenario. The primary endpoint was the optimal strategy for each gene, which they defined as the greatest QALYs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Many of the strategies were dominated (meaning they were both more expensive and less beneficial than competing strategies), but the pattern of which strategies were dominated and which were optimal differed by gene. For MLH1, the researchers found that the optimal strategy was annual colonoscopy starting at age 25 years, resulting in a cumulative CRC incidence of 17% compared to 53% with colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years. For MSH2, biennial colonoscopy starting at age 25 years was optimal (CRC incidence of 17% compared to 42% with colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years). For MSH6, surveillance every 3 years starting at age 35 years was found to be optimal (CRC incidence of 7% compared to 16% with colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years). Finally, for PMS2, surveillance every 3 years starting at age 40 years was optimal (CRC incidence of 3% compared to 8% with colonoscopy every 5 years starting at age 40 years). Consistent with previously established gene-specific CRC risk estimates, optimal strategies for MLH1 and MSH2 were more aggressive in terms of starting age and frequency as compared to optimal strategies for MSH6 and PMS2. Notably, however, even with the most aggressive strategy of annual colonoscopy starting at age 25 years, CRC incidence for MLH1 was 17%. To reduce CRC incidence further, frequent and early colonoscopy might need to be paired with chemoprevention (for instance, with daily aspirin11Burn J. Sheth H. Elliott F. et al.Cancer prevention with aspirin in hereditary colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), 10-year follow-up and registry-based 20-year data in the CAPP2 study: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although such an approach was not studied by Kastrinos et al.10Kastrinos F. Ingram M.A. Silver E.R. et al.Gene-specific variation in colorectal cancer surveillance strategies for Lynch syndrome.Gastroenterology. 2021; 161: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar Similarly, the optimal strategy for MSH2 (colonoscopy every 2 years, starting at age 25 years) also resulted in a CRC incidence rate of 17%. However, compared to MLH1, increasing the frequency of colonoscopy to annually in MSH2 led to lower incremental benefit (due to a lower risk of cancer in MSH2) and greater incremental cost (likely due to fewer resources saved related to averting fewer cancers), resulting in a very expensive incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,009,850/QALY compared to biennial colonoscopy. For PMS2, beginning surveillance at age 35 years actually resulted in fewer QALYs than beginning at age 40 years because of decrements in quality of life related to colonoscopy and/or rare complications rather than fewer life years saved. Depending on how burdensome an individual values colonoscopy and its complications, screening at age 35 years might be reasonable. This modeling study10Kastrinos F. Ingram M.A. Silver E.R. et al.Gene-specific variation in colorectal cancer surveillance strategies for Lynch syndrome.Gastroenterology. 2021; 161: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar is very useful because testing all of these surveillance strategies in a timely manner using the criterion standard of a randomized controlled trial would not be practical. However, a few limitations of the study are worth noting. First, the study assumes perfect adherence to surveillance and high-quality examinations, conditions that are unlikely to hold in real-world settings. In addition, there are other individual-level factors that likely modify CRC risk in LS and could affect the age at which to start or continue surveillance, such as the age at which a relative is diagnosed with CRC, male sex, and presence of adenoma on index colonoscopy.12Engel C. Vasen H.F. Seppälä T. et al.No difference in colorectal cancer incidence or stage at detection by colonoscopy among 3 countries with different Lynch syndrome surveillance policies.Gastroenterology. 2018; 155: 1400-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar Despite these limitations, this study highlights an important, cost-effective, gene-specific approach to CRC surveillance in patients with LS, with less aggressive strategies for individuals with MSH6 and PMS2 variants who may otherwise undergo more than 50 colonoscopies in their lifespans. As evidence to support tailored cancer surveillance strategies among individuals with LS grows, future studies are needed to understand the acceptability and feasibility of implementing these strategies. Gene-Specific Variation in Colorectal Cancer Surveillance Strategies for Lynch SyndromeGastroenterologyVol. 161Issue 2PreviewThis study analyzed data on risk of colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome and found that risk varies with genetic alteration associated with the disease, which should be used to determine starting age for colonoscopy surveillance and interval.

AB  - Dental and medical providers require similar patient demographic and clinical information for the management of a mutual patient. Despite an overlap in information needs, medical and dental data are created and stored in multiple records and locations. Electronic health information exchange (HIE) bridge gaps in health data spread across various providers. Enabling exchange via query-based HIE may provide critical information at the point of care during a dental visit. The purpose of this study is to characterize query-based HIE use during dental visits at two Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) that provided on-site dental services. First, we determine the proportion of dental visits for which providers accessed the HIE. Next, site, patient and visit characteristics associated with query-based HIE use during dental visits are examined. Last, among dental visits with HIE use, the aspects of the HIE that are accessed most frequently are described. HIE use was low (0.17%) during dental visits, however our findings from this study extend the body of research examining HIE use by studying a less explored area of the care continuum.

AB  - Goal: We sought to quantify the independent effects of age, sex, and race/ethnicity on risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia (AN) in Veterans. Study: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of Veterans aged 40 to 80 years who had diagnostic or screening colonoscopy between 2002 and 2009 from 1 of 14 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Natural language processing identified the most advanced finding and location (proximal, distal). Logistic regression was used to examine the adjusted, independent effects of age, sex, and race, both overall and in screening and diagnostic subgroups. Results: Among 90,598 Veterans [mean (SD) age 61.7 (9.4) y, 5.2% (n=4673) were women], CRC and AN prevalence was 1.3% (n=1171) and 8.9% (n=8081), respectively. Adjusted CRC risk was higher for diagnostic versus screening colonoscopy [odds ratio (OR)=3.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.19-4.50], increased with age, was numerically (but not statistically) higher for men overall (OR=1.53; 95% CI, 0.97-2.39) and in the screening subgroup (OR=2.24; 95% CI, 0.71-7.05), and was higher overall for Blacks and Hispanics, but not in screening. AN prevalence increased with age, and was present in 9.2% of men and 3.9% of women [adjusted OR=1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-2.25]. AN risk was 11% higher in Blacks than in Whites overall (OR=1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.20), was no different in screening, and was lower in Hispanics (OR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98). Women had more proximal CRC (63% vs. 39% for men; P =0.03), but there was no difference in proximal AN (38.3% for both genders). Conclusions: Age and race were associated with AN and CRC prevalence. Blacks had a higher overall prevalence of both CRC and AN, but not among screenings. Men had increased risk for AN, while women had a higher proportion of proximal CRC. These findings may be used to tailor when and how Veterans are screened for CRC.

AB  - The wait time clients spend during immunization clinic visits in low- and middle-income countries is a not well-understood reported barrier to vaccine completion. We used a prospective, observational design to document the total time from client arrival-to-discharge and all sequential provider-client activities in 1 urban, semi-urban, and rural immunization clinic in Nigeria. We also conducted caregiver and provider focus group discussions to identify perceived determinants of long clinic wait times. Our findings show that the time from arrival-to-discharge varied significantly by the clinic and ranged between 57 and 235 minutes, as did arrival-to-all providers-client activities. Focus group data attributed workflow delays to clinic staff waiting for a critical mass of clients to arrive for their immunization appointment before starting the essential health education talk or opening specific vaccine vials. Additionally, respondents indicated that complex documentation processes caused system delays. Research on clinic workflow transformation and simplification of immunization documentation is needed.

AB  - As use of electronic medical records (EMRs) increases in healthcare, multiple accreditation organizations recommend training future clinicians on EMRs as part of the academic curriculum. Therefore, some pharmacy programs now utilize an academic EMR. Our objective was to examine pharmacy instructors' early experiences with a commercially available teaching EMR (tEMR) in order to identify current and future priorities along with benefits and barriers to academic EMR use in pharmacy education. We conducted semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey with pharmacy instructors. Interview and survey data analyses consisted of hybrid inductive/deductive approaches to coding data and descriptive statistics, respectively. We mapped themes to the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP). Seven instructors participated in interviews, and 10 completed the survey. We identified 25 interview themes that were generally congruent with survey responses. A noted benefit of the tEMR was providing a large repository of real-life patient data. Instructors' current priorities for tEMR activities primarily aligned with “collect,” “assess,” and “plan” steps of the PPCP. One reported barrier was insufficient training regarding the tEMR capabilities. Instructors offered innovative ideas for future academic EMR use, including pharmacokinetics, incident reporting, and longitudinal cases. Study findings are most applicable to pharmacy programs in the early stages of academic EMR adoption. We identified opportunities for pharmacy programs to facilitate innovative, future use of academic EMRs, including curriculum planning, so pharmacy students gain experience using EMR functions for each PPCP step and develop more advanced EMR skills.

AB  - The lack of machine-interpretable representations of consent permissions precludes development of tools that act upon permissions across information ecosystems, at scale.To report the process, results, and lessons learned while annotating permissions in clinical consent forms.We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical consent forms. We developed an annotation scheme following the MAMA (Model-Annotate-Model-Annotate) cycle and evaluated interannotator agreement (IAA) using observed agreement (Ao), weighted kappa (κw ), and Krippendorff's α.The final dataset included 6,399 sentences from 134 clinical consent forms. Complete agreement was achieved for 5,871 sentences, including 211 positively identified and 5,660 negatively identified as permission-sentences across all three annotators (Ao = 0.944, Krippendorff's α = 0.599). These values reflect moderate to substantial IAA. Although permission-sentences contain a set of common words and structure, disagreements between annotators are largely explained by lexical variability and ambiguity in sentence meaning.Our findings point to the complexity of identifying permission-sentences within the clinical consent forms. We present our results in light of lessons learned, which may serve as a launching point for developing tools for automated permission extraction.

AB  - Nurse scientists are increasingly interested in conducting secondary research using real world collections of biospecimens and health data. The purposes of this scoping review are to (a) identify federal regulations and norms that bear authority or give guidance over reuse of residual clinical biospecimens and health data, (b) summarize domain experts’ interpretations of permissions of such reuse, and (c) summarize key issues for interpreting regulations and norms. Final analysis included 25 manuscripts and 23 regulations and norms. This review illustrates contextual complexity for reusing residual clinical biospecimens and health data, and explores issues such as privacy, confidentiality, and deriving genetic information from biospecimens. Inconsistencies make it difficult to interpret, which regulations or norms apply, or if applicable regulations or norms are congruent. Tools are necessary to support consistent, expert-informed consent processes and downstream reuse of residual clinical biospecimens and health data by nurse scientists.

AB  - Restrictions in sharing Patient Health Identifiers (PHI) limit cross-organizational re-use of free-text medical data. We leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce synthetic unstructured free-text medical data with low re-identification risk, and assess the suitability of these datasets to replicate machine learning models. We trained GAN models using unstructured free-text laboratory messages pertaining to salmonella, and identified the most accurate models for creating synthetic datasets that reflect the informational characteristics of the original dataset. Natural Language Generation metrics comparing the real and synthetic datasets demonstrated high similarity. Decision models generated using these datasets reported high performance metrics. There was no statistically significant difference in performance measures reported by models trained using real and synthetic datasets. Our results inform the use of GAN models to generate synthetic unstructured free-text data with limited re-identification risk, and use of this data to enable collaborative research and re-use of machine learning models.

AB  - Background Models estimating risk for advanced proximal colorectal neoplasia (APN) may be used to select colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test, either prior to knowing distal colorectal findings or afterward. Current models have only fair discrimination and nearly all require knowing distal findings. Objective Derive and test risk prediction models for APN with and without distal findings. Setting Selected endoscopy centers within central Indiana, USA. Participants Average-risk persons undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy Interventions Demographics, personal and family medical history, lifestyle factors and physical measures were linked to the most advanced finding in proximal and distal colorectal segments. For both models, logistic regression identified factors independently associated with APN on a derivation set. Based on equation coefficients, points were assigned to each factor, and risk for APN was examined for each score. Scores with comparable risks were collapsed into risk categories. Both models and their scoring systems were tested on the validation set. Main outcome APN, defined as any adenoma or sessile serrated lesion ≥1 cm, one with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia, or CRC proximal to the descending colon. Results Among 3025 subjects in the derivation set (mean age 57.3 ± 6.5 years; 52% women), APN prevalence was 4.5%; 2859 (94.5%) had complete data on risk factors. Independently associated with APN were age, sex, cigarette smoking, cohabitation status, metabolic syndrome, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and physical activity. This model (without distal findings) was well-calibrated ( P = 0.62) and had good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.73). In low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups that comprised 21, 58 and 21% of the sample, respectively, APN risks were 1.47% (95% CI, 0.67–2.77%), 3.09% (CI, 2.31–4.04%) and 11.6% (CI, 9.10–14.4%), respectively ( P &lt; 0.0001), with no proximal CRCs in the low-risk group and 2 in the intermediate-risk group. When tested in the validation set of 1455, the model retained good metrics (calibration P = 0.85; c-statistic = 0.83), with APN risks in low- (22%), intermediate- (56%) and high-risk (22%) subgroups of 0.62% (CI, 0.08–2.23%) 2.20% (CI, 1.31–3.46%) and 13.0% (CI, 9.50–17.2%), respectively ( P &lt; 0.0001). There were no proximal CRCs in the low-risk group, and two in the intermediate-risk group. The model with distal findings performed comparably, with validation set metrics of 0.18 for calibration, 0.76 for discrimination and APN risk (% sample) in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups of 1.1 (69%), 8.3 (22%) and 22.3% (9%). Conclusion These models stratify large proportions of average-risk persons into clinically meaningful risk groups, and could improve screening efficiency, particularly for noncolonoscopy-based programs.

AB  - Background. In some health care systems, patients face long wait times for screening colonoscopy. We sought to assess whether patients at low risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) would be willing to delay their own colonoscopy so higher-risk peers could undergo colonoscopy sooner. Methods. We surveyed 1054 Veterans regarding their attitudes toward repeat colonoscopy and risk-based prioritization. We used multivariable regression to identify patient factors associated with willingness to delay screening for a higher-risk peer. Results. Despite a physician recommendation to stop screening, 29% of respondents reported being “not at all likely” to stop. However, 94% reported that they would be willing to delay their own colonoscopy for a higher-risk peer. Greater trust in physician and greater health literacy were positively associated with willingness to wait, while greater perceived threat of CRC and Black or Latino race/ethnicity were negatively associated with willingness to wait. Conclusion. Despite high enthusiasm for repeat screening, patients were willing to delay their own colonoscopy for higher-risk peers. Appealing to altruism could be effective when utilizing scarce resources.

AB  - With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, states were given the option to expand their Medicaid programs. Since then, thirty-eight states and Washington, D.C., have done so. Previous work has identified the widespread effects of expansion on enrollment and the financial implications for individuals, hospitals, and the federal government, yet administrative expenditures have not been considered. Using data from all fifty states for the period 2007–17, our study estimated the effects of Medicaid expansion overall, as well as differing effects by the size and nature of the expansions. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we found no overall effect of expansion on administrative spending. However, the size of the expansion may have produced differing effects. States with small expansions experienced some increases in administrative spending, whereas states with large expansions experienced some decreases in administrative spending, including a $77 reduction in per enrollee administrative spending compared with nonexpansion states. As more states consider expanding their Medicaid programs, our findings provide evidence of potential effects.

AB  - The objective of this study was to increase screening for falls and dementia by improving interprofessional (IP) providers' and staffs' knowledge and attitudes toward the care of older patients and team-based care. An intervention, including education about screening and an electronic health record (EHR) flowsheet, was rolled-out across eight Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC). Participants were 262 IP health providers who served 6670 patients ≥ age 65 > age 65 . An EHR flowsheet with two-item screeners for falls and dementia triggered automatically for patients ≥ age 65. Documentation of screening for falls and dementia was abstracted from the EHR for the year prior to and the year after the interventions began. Baseline screening rates for falls and dementia were flat; from the start of education intervention until EHR live date, screening rates increased significantly; after EHR live date, the screening rates continued increasing significantly. A combined education-system intervention can improve screening for falls and dementia in FQHC.

AB  - Health insurers use narrow and tiered networks to lower costs by contracting with, or favoring, selected providers. Little is known about the contemporary effects of narrow or tiered networks on key metrics. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence on how narrow and tiered networks impact cost, access, quality, and patient steering. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for articles published from January 2000 to June 2020. Both narrow and tiered networks are associated with reduced overall health care costs for most cost-related measures. Evidence pertaining to access to care and quality measures were more limited to a narrow set of outcomes or were weak in internal validity, but generally concluded no systematic adverse effects on narrow or tiered networks. Narrow and tiered networks appear to reduce costs without affecting some quality measures. More research on quality outcomes is warranted.

AB  - Pediatric asthma is a common cause of emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and mortality. Population incidence studies have historically used large-scale survey data. We measured these epidemiologic trends using a health information exchange.In this retrospective cohort study, we used electronic health record data from a regional health information exchange to study clinical trends in pediatric patients presenting to the hospital for asthma in the State of Indiana. Data was obtained from 2010 to 2019 and included all patients ages 2-18 years. Study participants were identified using international classification of disease codes. The measured outcomes were number of hospital encounters per year, percentage of admissions per year, and mortality rates.Data included 50,393 unique patients and 88,772 unique encounters, with 57% male patients. Over the ten-year period, hospital encounters ranged from 5000 to 8000 per year with no change in trajectory. Between 2010 and 2012, the percent of encounters admitted to the hospital was ∼30%. This decreased to ∼20-25% for 2015-2019. Patient mortality rates increased from 1 to 3 per 1000 patient encounters in 2010-2014 to between 5 and 7 per 1000 patient encounters from 2016 to 2019. White patients had a significantly higher admission percentage compared to other racial groups, but no difference in mortality rate.Asthma continues to be a common condition requiring hospital care for pediatric patients. Regional health information exchanges can enable public health researchers to follow asthma trends in near real time, and have potential for informing patient-level public health interventions.

AB  - hospital transfers and admissions are critical events in the care of nursing home residents. We sought to determine hospital transfer rates at different ages.a cohort of 1,187 long-stay nursing home residents who had participated in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid demonstration project. We analysed the number of hospital transfers of the study participants recorded by the Minimum Data Set. Using a modern regression technique, we depicted the annual rate of hospital transfers as a smooth function of age.transfer rates declined with age in a nonlinear fashion. Rates were the highest among residents younger than 60 years of age (1.30-2.15 transfers per year), relatively stable between 60 and 80 (1.17-1.30 transfers per year) and lower in those older than 80 (0.77-1.17 transfers per year). Factors associated with increased risk of transfers included prior diagnoses of hip fracture (annual incidence rate ratio or IRR: 2.057, 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.240, 3.412]), dialysis (IRR: 1.717, 95% CI: [1.313, 2.246]), urinary tract infection (IRR: 1.755, 95% CI: [1.361, 2.264]), pneumonia (IRR: 1.501, 95% CI: [1.072, 2.104]), daily pain (IRR: 1.297, 95% CI: [1.055,1.594]), anaemia (IRR: 1.229, 95% CI [1.068, 1.414]) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (IRR: 1.168, 95% CI: [1.010,1.352]). Transfer rates were lower in residents who had orders reflecting preferences for comfort care (IRR: 0.79, 95% CI: [0.665, 0.936]).younger nursing home residents may require specialised interventions to reduce hospital transfers; declining transfer rates with the oldest age groups may reflect preferences for comfort-focused care.

AB  - To help clinicians provide timely treatment and delay disease progression, it is crucial to identify dementia patients during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage and stratify these MCI patients into early and late MCI stages before they progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the process of diagnosing MCI and AD in living patients, brain scans are collected using neuroimaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET). These brain scans measure the volume and molecular activity within the brain resulting in a very promising avenue to diagnose patients early in a minimally invasive manner.We have developed an optimal transport based transfer learning model to discriminate between early and late MCI. Combing this transfer learning model with bootstrap aggregation strategy, we overcome the overfitting problem and improve model stability and prediction accuracy.With the transfer learning methods that we have developed, we outperform the current state of the art MCI stage classification frameworks and show that it is crucial to leverage Alzheimer's disease and normal control subjects to accurately predict early and late stage cognitive impairment.Our method is the current state of the art based on benchmark comparisons. This method is a necessary technological stepping stone to widespread clinical usage of MRI-based early detection of AD.

AB  - A majority of Americans favor universal health insurance, but there is uncertainty over how best to achieve this goal. Whatever the insurance design that is implemented, additional details that must be considered include breadth of services covered, restrictions and limits on volumes of services, cost-sharing for individuals, and pricing. In the hopes that research can inform this ongoing debate, we review evidence supporting different models for achieving universal coverage in the US and identify areas where additional research and stakeholder input is needed. Key areas in need of further research include how care should be organized, how costs can be reduced, and what healthcare services universal insurance should cover.

AB  - Faculty development programs encouraging clinician educators' scholarship have been established at many medical schools. The same is true for programs that address the isolation and loneliness many faculty members feel in their day-to-day clinical work and administration. Few programs have explicitly combined development of scholarship and sense of community.The goals of the Advanced Scholars Program for Internists in Research and Education (ASPIRE) are as follows: (1) provide training in scholarship development including research methods, implementation, and dissemination; (2) provide expert mentoring and support for professional development; and (3) create a greater sense of campus community.ASPIRE scholars are clinician educators in the Department of Medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine.The program runs 18 months, includes intensive mentoring, covered time for scholars and mentors, resources, and two half-day educational sessions per month focused on scholarship and community development.Institutional leaders' public statements and actions regarding ASPIRE were documented by program leadership. Data collected from ASPIRE mentors and scholars through interviews and free text survey responses were analyzed using an immersion/crystallization approach. Two central themes were identified for both scholars and mentors: benefits and challenges of the program. Benefits included mentors, program design, community development, increased confidence, skills development, improved patient care, and institutional impact. Challenges included time to accomplish the program, balance of community-building and skills development, and lack of a clear path post-ASPIRE.Combining skills-based learning with safe psychological space were judged important elements of success for the ASPIRE program. Conversations are ongoing to identify opportunities for scholars who have completed the program to continue to pursue scholarship, expand their skills, and build community. We conclude that the program both is feasible and was well-received. Sustainability and generalizability are important next steps in ensuring the viability of the program.

AB  - Sleep tracker data have not been utilized routinely in sleep-related disorders and their management. Sleep-related disorders are common in primary care practice and incorporating sleep tracker data may help in improving patient care. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a sleep program using the Fitbit Charge 2™ device and SleepLife® application. The main aim of the study was to examine whether a program using a commercially available wearable sleep tracker device providing objective sleep data would improve communication in primary care settings between patients and their providers. Secondary aims included whether patient satisfaction with care would improve as result of the program.A prospective, randomized, parallel group, observational pilot study was conducted in 20 primary care clinics in Indianapolis, IN from June 2018 to February 2019. Inclusion criteria included patients over the age of 18, have a diagnosis of insomnia identified by electronic medical record and/or a validated questionnaire, and were on a prescription sleep aid. The study was not specific to any sleep aid prescription, branded or generic, and was not designed to evaluate a drug or drug class. Each primary care clinic was randomized to either the SleepLife® intervention or the control arm. All patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge 2™ device. Only patients in the intervention arm were educated on how to use the SleepLife® application. Physicians in the intervention arm were set up with the SleepLife® portal on their computers.Forty-nine physicians and 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 12.8) years and 61% were female. Mean age of physicians was 47 (SD 10.6) years. Patients showed high rates of involvement in the program with 83% completing all survey questions. Physician survey completion rate was 55%. Only one physician logged into the SleepLife portal to check their patients' sleep status. At the end of the 6-week intervention, patients' composite general satisfaction scores with sleep health management decreased significantly in the intervention arm when compared to controls (p = 0.03). Patients' satisfaction with communication also decreased significantly in the intervention group (p = 0.01). The sleep outcomes, which were calculated on the basis of study questionnaire answers, improved significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Physician communication satisfaction scores remained unchanged (p = 0.12).SleepLife® and its related physician portal can facilitate physician-patient communication, and it captures patient sleep outcomes including behaviors and habits. Patients were highly engaged with the program, while physicians did not demonstrate engagement. The study design and questionnaires do not specifically address the reasons behind the decreased patient satisfaction with care and communication, but it was perceived to be a result of physician non-responsiveness. Sleep quality scores on the other hand showed an improvement among SleepLife® users, suggesting that patients may have implemented good sleep practices on their own. Given that it was a feasibility study, and the sample size was small, we were not able to make major inferences regarding the difference between sleep disorder types. Additionally, we excluded patients with a history of alcohol use, substance abuse, or depression because of concerns that they may affect sleep independently. To promote the growth of technology in primary care, further research incorporating results from this study and physician engagement techniques should be included.

AB  - To enhance cancer prevention and survivorship care by local health care providers, a school of public health introduced an innovative telelearning continuing education program using the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model. In ECHO's hub and spoke structure, synchronous videoconferencing connects frontline health professionals at various locations ("spokes") with experts at the facilitation center ("hub"). Sessions include experts' didactic presentations and case discussions led by spoke site participants. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the reasons individuals choose or decline to participate in the Cancer ECHO program and to identify incentives and barriers to doing so.Study participants were recruited from the hub team, spoke site participants, and providers who attended another ECHO program but not this one. Participants chose to take a survey or be interviewed. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided qualitative data coding and analysis.We conducted 22 semistructured interviews and collected 30 surveys. Incentives identified included the program's high-quality design, supportive learning climate, and access to information. Barriers included a lack of external incentives to participate and limited time available. Participants wanted more adaptability in program timing to fit providers' busy schedules.Although the merits of the Cancer ECHO program were widely acknowledged, adaptations to facilitate participation and emphasize the program's benefits may help overcome barriers to attending. As the number of telelearning programs grows, the results of this study point to ways to expand participation and spread health benefits more widely.

AB  - BackgroundBlood pressure control has been shown to reduce risk of vascular events and mortality after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Yet, questions remain about effectiveness, timing, and targeted blood pressure reduction.MethodsWe analyzed data from a retrospective cohort of 18,837 veterans cared for 12 months prior and up to 12 months after an emergency department visit or inpatient admission for stroke or TIA. Latent class growth analysis was used to classify patients into systolic blood pressure trajectories. With Cox proportional hazard models, we examined relationships between blood pressure trajectories, intensification of antihypertensive medication, and stroke (fatal or non-fatal) and all-cause mortality in 12 months following the index event.ResultsThe cohort was classified into 4 systolic blood pressure trajectories: 19% with a low systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 116 mm Hg); 65% with a medium systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 136 mm Hg); 15% with a high systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 158 mm Hg), and 1% with a very high trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 183 mm Hg). After the stroke or TIA, individuals in the high and very high systolic blood pressure trajectories experienced a substantial decrease in systolic blood pressure that coincided with intensification of antihypertensive medication. Patients with very low and very high systolic blood pressure trajectories had a significantly greater (P < .05) hazard of mortality, while medication intensification was related significantly (P < .05) to lower hazard of mortality.ConclusionsThese findings point to the importance of monitoring blood pressure over multiple time points and of instituting enhanced hypertension management after stroke or TIA, particularly for individuals with high or very high blood pressure trajectories.

AB  - ObjectivesAccess to timely care is important for patients with stroke, where rapid diagnosis and treatment affect functional status, disability, and mortality. Telestroke programs connect stroke specialists with emergency department staff at facilities without on-site stroke expertise. The objective of this study was to examine healthcare costs for patients with stroke who sought care before and after implementation of the US Department of Veterans Affairs National TeleStroke Program (NTSP).MethodsWe identified 471 patients who had a stroke and sought care at a telestroke site and compared them to 529 patients with stroke who received stroke care at the same sites before telestroke implementation. We examined patient costs for 12 months before and after stroke, using a linear model with a patient-level fixed effect.ResultsNTSP was associated with significantly higher rates of patients receiving guideline concordant care. Compared with control patients, those treated by NTSP were 14.3 percentage points more likely to receive tissue plasminogen activator and 4.3 percentage points more likely to receive a thrombectomy (all P < .0001). NTSP was associated with $4821 increased costs for patients with stroke in the first 30 days after the program (2019 dollars). There were no observed savings over 12 months, and the added costs of care were attributable to higher rates of guideline concordant care.ConclusionsTelestroke programs are unlikely to yield short-term savings because optimal stroke care is expensive. Healthcare organizations should expect increases in healthcare costs for patients treated for stroke in the first year after implementing a telestroke program.

AB  - Breast conservation surgery (BCS) and mastectomy have equivalent survivability. However, perception of surgical benefit may be affected by breast cancer subtypes, impacting procedure choice. We evaluate surgical management among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and White (NHW) breast cancer patients based on subtypes.Queried the National Cancer Database (NCDB) including BCS eligible women with T1 (<2cm) breast cancer between 2011 and 2016. We selected NHB and NHW women and evaluated differences in sociodemographic variables and treatment including surgery. To determine factors associated with receipt of BCS, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, race, surgery type and breast cancer subtypes.Analyzed 390,278 women with 89.7% NHW and 10.3% NHB, of mean age 63 years. 55.4% vs. 53.5% of NHW compared to NHB women had BCS (p<.001) as initial cancer therapy. Statistically significant differences between NHB and NHW in surgery were found on univariate analysis in all breast cancer subtypes except Luminal B. NHB women with TNBC and Luminal A subtypes were more likely to undergo BCS on multivariate analysis.Significant differences are found in the surgical management of breast cancer with Black women more likely to receive BCS, less likely to undergo mastectomy compared to White counterparts even with TNBC or her-2+ subtypes. Understanding surgical decision making and how knowledge of subtype is applied deserves further study in women of diverse racial and ethnic groups.

AB  - Hospitalizations for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the quality of care and outcomes for patients with AIS/TIA before vs. during the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system.This retrospective cohort study compared AIS/TIA care quality before (March-September 2019) vs. during (March-September 2020) the pandemic. Electronic health record data were used to identify patient characteristics, quality of care and outcomes. The without-fail rate was a composite measure summarizing whether an individual patient received all of the seven processes for which they were eligible. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to assess differences between the two periods.A decrease in presentations occurred during the pandemic (N = 4360 vs. N = 5636 patients; p = 0.003) and was greater for patients with TIA (-30.4%) than for AIS (-18.7%). The without-fail rate improved during the pandemic (56.2 vs. before 50.1%). The use of high/moderate potency statins increased among AIS patients (OR 1.26 [1.06-1.48]) and remained unchanged among those with TIA (OR 1.04 [0.83,1.29]). Blood pressure measurement within 90-days of discharge was less frequent during the pandemic (57.8 vs. 89.2%, p < 0.001). Hypertension control decreased among patients with AIS (OR 0.73 [0.60-0.90]) and TIA (OR 0.72 [0.54-0.96]). The average systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 1.9/1.4 mmHg higher during the pandemic than before (p < 0.001). Compared to before, during the pandemic fewer AIS patients had a primary care visit (52.5% vs. 79.8%; p = 0.0001) or a neurology visit (27.9 vs. 41.1%; p = 0.085). Both 30- and 90-day unadjusted all-cause mortality rates were higher in 2020 (3.6% and 6.7%) vs. 2019 (2.9, 5.4%; p = 0.041 and p = 0.006); but these differences were not statistically significant after risk adjustment.Overall quality of care for patients with AIS/TIA did not decline during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - To determine whether preventive dental visits are associated with fewer subsequent nonpreventive dental visits and lower dental expenditures.Indiana Medicaid enrollment and claims data (2015-2018) and the Area Health Resource File.A repeated measures design with individual and year fixed effects examining the relationship between preventive dental visits (PDVs) and nonpreventive dental visits (NPVs) and dental expenditures.Not applicable.Of 28,152 adults (108,349 observation-years) meeting inclusion criteria, 36.0% had a dental visit, 27.8% a PDV, and 22.1% a NPV. Compared to no PDV in the prior year, at least one was associated with fewer NPVs (β = -0.13; 95% CI -0.12, -0.11), lower NPV expenditures (β = -$29.12.53; 95% CI -28.07, -21.05), and lower total dental expenditures (-$70.12; 95% -74.92, -65.31), as well as fewer PDVs (β = -0.24; 95% CI -0.26, -0.23).Our findings suggest that prior year PDVs are associated with fewer subsequent NPVs and lower dental expenditures among Medicaid-enrolled adults. Thus, from a public insurance program standpoint, supporting preventive dental care use may translate into improved population oral health outcomes and lower dental costs among certain low-income adult populations, but barriers to consistent utilization of PDV prohibit definitive findings.

AB  - Objective: To determine if race-ethnicity is correlated with case-fatality rates among low-income patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Research Design: Observational cohort study using electronic health record data.Patients: All patients assessed for COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2021 at one safety net health system.Measures: Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and hospital care processes and outcomes.Results: Among 25,253 patients as­sessed for COVID-19, 6,357 (25.2%) were COVID-19 positive: 1,480 (23.3%) hospitalized; 334 (22.6%) required intensive care; and 106 (7.3%) died. More His­panic patients tested positive (51.8%) than non-Hispanic Black (31.4%) and White patients (16.7%, P&lt;.001]. Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger, more often uninsured, and less likely to have comorbid conditions. Non-Hispanic Black patients had significantly more diabetes, hyperten­sion, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and asthma (P&lt;.05). Non-Hispanic White patients were older and had more cigarette smoking history, COPD, and cancer. Non- Hispanic White patients were more likely to receive intensive care (29.6% vs 21.1% vs 20.8%, P=.007) and more likely to die (12% vs 7.3% vs 3.5%, P&lt;.001) compared with non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients, respectively. Length of stay was similar for all groups. In logistic regres­sion models, Medicaid insurance status independently correlated with hospitaliza­tion (OR 3.67, P&lt;.001) while only age (OR 1.076, P&lt;.001) and cerebrovascular disease independently correlated with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.887, P=.002).Conclusions: Observed COVID-19 in-hospital mortality rate was lower than most published rates. Age, but not race-ethnicity, was independently correlated with in-hospital mortality. Safety net health systems are foundational in the care of vulnerable patients suffering from COVID-19, including patients from under-represented and low-income groups.

AB  - The care of older adults with complex medical conditions requires effective team-based care.Nursing and social work students need a curriculum that provides them with immersive experiences in geriatrics to prepare them for competent practice.This Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program supported 5 advanced practice nursing (APN) and 5 master of social work (MSW) student fellows in a 2-semester program, with 3 cohorts completing the fellowship over 3 years (N = 30).By the completion of the fellowship, students had (1) demonstrated increased knowledge of age-related changes and health problems experienced by older adults, (2) developed clinical competencies in providing patient-centered health care for older adults, and (3) assessed the fellowship as helpful in preparing for interprofessional team care.An interprofessional gerontology fellowship for APN and MSW students can develop knowledge and skills in team-based care for older adults. Recommendations for creating a fellowship curriculum are provided.

AB  - Care of the critically injured burn patient presents unique challenges to the intensivist. Certified burn centers are rare and geographically sparse, necessitating that much of the initial management of patients with severe burn injuries must happen in the pre-burn center setting. Severe burn injuries often lead to a wide range of complications that extend beyond the loss of skin integrity and require specialized care. As such, medical intensivists are often called on to stabilize these critically injured patients. This focused review outlines the clinical care of these medically complex patients, including airway management, postburn complications, volume resuscitation, nutrition, and end-of-life care.

AB  - BackgroundThe Indiana University Center for Global Health coined the term reciprocal innovation to describe bidirectional, mutually beneficial research and translational research within long-term global health partnerships. Inspired by a 30-year global health partnership between Indiana University (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Moi University College of Health Sciences (Eldoret, Kenya), we developed a reciprocal innovation programme based at the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (Indianapolis, IN, USA). We describe early lessons in building this programme and its potential as a transformative approach to address systemic inequities across high-income and low/middle-income countries.MethodsThe reciprocal innovation programme, established in 2016, aims to identify and support research on the design, testing, replication, and dissemination of health technologies and interventions that have applicability across high-income and low-income and middle-income countries. Central to this process is the building of equitable, mutually beneficial global health partnerships. Programme activities, informed by an environmental scan of stakeholders in Indiana, USA and Kenya, included funding a competitive research grants programme, hosting workshops for community-based and global health researchers, and creating educational and training videos on reciprocal innovation approaches.FindingsTo date, the programme has awarded more than 30 grants totalling US$ 610 000 for research in nine countries. Examples of funded cross-continent reciprocal innovation projects include the application of rapid testing for falsified drug detection in Malawi and for use by harm reduction organisations in the USA, and the adoption of a Kenyan community health-worker model to reduce infant mortality in Indiana. These projects, among others, are resulting in measurable improvements in health outcomes in both Indiana and abroad, and continue to expand. Three global reciprocal innovation workshops have been held and an online database has been created to showcase research in this area.InterpretationIn the first 5 years of the programme, we have engaged investigators and launched projects internationally in reciprocal innovation, illustrating a new approach to global health research, translation, and partnerships. Although this programme is in early stages and still developing metrics to assess its success, reciprocal innovation has the potential to help to address systemic inequities and global challenges in both high-income and low-income and middle-income settings through long-term, equitable, and mutually beneficial partnerships.FundingThis work is partly supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) grant number UL1TR00252.

AB  - Patient experience serves as both a subjective measure of value-based health care delivery and a metric to inform operational decision making. The objective of this study was to determine if specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions affect patient experience scores for children seen in the emergency department.We performed a retrospective observational study in the emergency department of a large quaternary care children's hospital on patients who were discharged to home and later completed a National Research Corporation Health patient experience survey. We matched the survey results to electronic health record (EHR) data and were able to extract demographics, operational metrics, and order information for each patient. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to determine the association of image acquisition, laboratory test ordering, medication administration, and discharge prescribing with likelihood to recommend the facility as our measure of patient experience.Of the 4103 patients who met inclusion criteria for the study, 75% strongly recommended the facility. Longer wait times were associated with lower patient experience scores [odds ratio (OR) per waiting room hour increase, 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-0.81]. Significant diagnostic factors associated with higher patient experience included magnetic resonance imaging ordering (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.00-5.67), x-ray ordering (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42), and electrocardiogram ordering (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44). Of the treatment factors studied, only antibiotic prescribing at discharge was found to have a significant positive association with patient experience (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.63).The positive association between more intensive diagnostic workups and patient experience could have implications on the utility of patient experience scores to evaluate pediatric care teams. Consideration should be taken to interpret patient experience scores in the context of compliance with approaches in evidence-based medicine.

AB  - Introduction: Nonresponse bias occurs when participants in a study differ from eligible nonparticipants in ways that can distort study conclusions. The current study uses successive wave analysis, an established but underutilized approach, to assess nonresponse bias in a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study. Such an approach makes use of reminders to induce participation among individuals. Based on the response continuum theory, those requiring several reminders to participate are more like nonrespondents than those who participate in a study upon first invitation, thus allowing for an examination of factors affecting participation. Methods: Study participants from the Indiana Population Prevalence SARS-CoV-2 Study were divided into 3 groups (eg, waves) based upon the number of reminders that were needed to induce participation. Independent variables were then used to determine whether key demographic characteristics as well as other variables hypothesized to influence study participation differed by wave using chi-square analyses. Specifically, we examined whether race, age, gender, education level, health status, tobacco behaviors, COVID-19–related symptoms, reasons for participating in the study, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates differed by wave. Results: Respondents included 3658 individuals, including 1495 in wave 1 (40.9%), 1246 in wave 2 (34.1%), and 917 in wave 3 (25%), for an overall participation rate of 23.6%. No significant differences in any examined variables were observed across waves, suggesting similar characteristics among those needing additional reminders compared with early participants. Conclusions: Using established techniques, we found no evidence of nonresponse bias in a random sample with a relatively low response rate. A hypothetical additional wave of participants would be unlikely to change original study conclusions. Successive wave analysis is an effective and easy tool that can allow public health researchers to assess, and possibly adjust for, nonresponse in any epidemiological survey that uses reminders to encourage participation.

AB  - Efforts to reduce health care spending have focused on reducing use of low-value services, but relatively few performance measures address overuse of care. In 2012, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation’s “Choosing Wisely” (CW) campaign identified 45 low-value services that clinicians and patients should avoid. Translating these overuse concepts into performance measures could assist in discouraging the use of these services. We assessed the feasibility and utility of converting these recommendations into e-Measures based on data from electronic health records [EHR]).We used four criteria to evaluate 45 CW recommendations for e-Measure development: (1) feasibility of extracting needed data from EHR systems meeting Meaningful Use Stage 2 standards; (2) whether the recommendation’s terminology was sufficiently specific for translation into an e-Measure; (3) scientific evidence supporting the recommendation; and (4) impact on reducing resource use.Only six of the 45 CW recommendations were deemed feasible for e-Measure development. Thirty-two recommendations require data elements unlikely to be found in current EHR systems; eight of 45 recommendations do not use sufficiently specific terminology.Improved capture of clinical information in EHRs and greater specificity of clinical terminology are required to advance these overuse concepts into standardized e-measures.

AB  - Abstract Background MetaMap is a valuable tool for processing biomedical texts to identify concepts. Although MetaMap is highly configurative, configuration decisions are not straightforward. Objective To develop a systematic, data-driven methodology for configuring MetaMap for optimal performance. Methods MetaMap, the word2vec model, and the phrase model were used to build a pipeline. For unsupervised training, the phrase and word2vec models used abstracts related to clinical decision support as input. During testing, MetaMap was configured with the default option, one behavior option, and two behavior options. For each configuration, cosine and soft cosine similarity scores between identified entities and gold-standard terms were computed for 40 annotated abstracts (422 sentences). The similarity scores were used to calculate and compare the overall percentages of exact matches, similar matches, and missing gold-standard terms among the abstracts for each configuration. The results were manually spot-checked. The precision, recall, and F-measure (β =1) were calculated. Results The percentages of exact matches and missing gold-standard terms were 0.6–0.79 and 0.09–0.3 for one behavior option, and 0.56–0.8 and 0.09–0.3 for two behavior options, respectively. The percentages of exact matches and missing terms for soft cosine similarity scores exceeded those for cosine similarity scores. The average precision, recall, and F-measure were 0.59, 0.82, and 0.68 for exact matches, and 1.00, 0.53, and 0.69 for missing terms, respectively. Conclusion We demonstrated a systematic approach that provides objective and accurate evidence guiding MetaMap configurations for optimizing performance. Combining objective evidence and the current practice of using principles, experience, and intuitions outperforms a single strategy in MetaMap configurations. Our methodology, reference codes, measurements, results, and workflow are valuable references for optimizing and configuring MetaMap.

AB  - Background/Aims A significant number of people with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia diagnoses will be cared for in nursing homes near the end of life. Advance care planning (ACP), the process of eliciting and documenting patient-centered preferences for care, is considered essential to providing high quality care for this population. Nursing homes are currently required by regulations to offer ACP to residents and families, but no training requirements exist for nursing home staff, and approaches to fulfilling this regulatory and ethical responsibility vary. As a result, residents may receive care inconsistent with their goals, such as unwanted hospitalizations. Pragmatic trials offer a way to develop and test ACP in real-world settings to increase the likelihood of adoption of sustainable best practices. Methods The “Aligning Patient Preferences—a Role Offering Alzheimer’s patients, Caregivers, and Healthcare Providers Education and Support (APPROACHES)” project is designed to pragmatically test and evaluate a staff-led program in 137 nursing homes (68 = intervention, 69 = control) owned by two nursing home corporations. Existing nursing home staff receive standardized training and implement the ACP Specialist program under the supervision of a corporate lead. The primary trial outcome is the annual rate of hospital transfers (admissions and emergency department visits). Consistent with the spirit of a pragmatic trial, study outcomes rely on data already collected for quality improvement, clinical, or billing purposes. Configurational analysis will also be performed to identify conditions associated with implementation. Results Partnerships with large corporate companies enable the APPROACHES trial to rely on corporate infrastructure to roll out the intervention, with support for a corporate implementation lead who is charged with the initial introduction and ongoing support for nursing home-based ACP Specialists. These internal champions connect the project with other company priorities and use strategies familiar to nursing home leaders for the initiation of other programs. Standardized data collection across nursing homes also supports the conduct of pragmatic trials in this setting. Discussion Many interventions to improve care in nursing homes have failed to demonstrate an impact or, if successful, maintain an impact over time. Pragmatic trials, designed to test interventions in real-world contexts that are evaluated through existing data sources collected routinely as part of clinical care, are well suited for the nursing home environment. A robust program that increases access to ACP for nursing home residents has the potential to increase goal-concordant care and is expected to reduce hospital transfers. If successful, the ACP Specialist Program will be primed for rapid translation into nursing home practice to reduce unwanted, burdensome hospitalizations and improve the quality of care for residents with dementia.

AB  - As the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system seeks to expand access to comprehensive geriatric assessments, evidence-based models of care are needed to support community-dwelling older persons. We evaluated the VA Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (VA-GRACE) program's effect on mortality and readmissions, as well as patient, caregiver, and staff satisfaction.This retrospective cohort included patients admitted to the Richard L. Roudebush VA hospital (2010-2019) who received VA-GRACE services post-discharge and usual care controls who were potentially eligible for VA-GRACE but did not receive services. The VA-GRACE program provided home-based comprehensive, multi-disciplinary geriatrics assessment, and ongoing care. Primary outcomes included 90-day and 1-year all-cause readmissions and mortality, and patient, caregiver, and staff satisfaction. We used propensity score modeling with overlapping weighting to adjust for differences in characteristics between groups.VA-GRACE patients (N = 683) were older than controls (N = 4313) (mean age 78.3 ± 8.2 standard deviation vs. 72.2 ± 6.9 years; p < 0.001) and had greater comorbidity (median Charlson Comorbidity Index 3 vs. 0; p < 0.001). VA-GRACE patients had higher 90-day readmissions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55 [95%CI 1.01-2.38]) and higher 1-year readmissions (aOR 1.74 [95%CI 1.22-2.48]). However, VA-GRACE patients had lower 90-day mortality (aOR 0.31 [95%CI 0.11-0.92]), but no statistically significant difference in 1-year mortality was observed (aOR 0.88 [95%CI 0.55-1.41]). Patients and caregivers reported that VA-GRACE home visits reduced travel burden and the program linked Veterans and caregivers to needed resources. Primary care providers reported that the VA-GRACE team helped to reduce their workload, improved medication management for their patients, and provided a view into patients' daily living situation.The VA-GRACE program provides comprehensive geriatric assessments and care to high-risk, community-dwelling older persons with high rates of satisfaction from patients, caregivers, and providers. Widespread deployment of programs like VA-GRACE will be required to support Veterans aging in place.

AB  - Medical evidence from more recent observational studies may significantly alter our understanding of disease incidence and progression, and would require recalibration of existing computational and predictive disease models. However, it is often challenging to perform recalibration when there are a large number of model parameters to be estimated. Moreover, comparing the fitting performances of candidate parameter designs can be difficult due to significant variation in simulated outcomes under limited computational budget and long runtime, even for one simulation replication.We developed a two-phase recalibration procedure. As a proof-of-the-concept study, we verified the procedure in the context of sex-specific colorectal neoplasia development. We considered two individual-based state-transition stochastic simulation models, estimating model parameters that govern colorectal adenoma occurrence and its growth through three preclinical states: non-advanced precancerous polyp, advanced precancerous polyp, and cancerous polyp. For the calibration, we used a weighted-sum-squared error between three prevalence values reported in the literature and the corresponding simulation outcomes. In phase 1 of the calibration procedure, we first extracted the baseline parameter design from relevant studies on the same model. We then performed sampling-based searches within a proper range around the baseline design to identify the initial set of good candidate designs. In phase 2, we performed local search (e.g., the Nelder-Mead algorithm), starting from the candidate designs identified at the end of phase 1. Further, we investigated the efficiency of exploring dimensions of the parameter space sequentially based on our prior knowledge of the system dynamics.The efficiency of our two-phase re-calibration procedure was first investigated with CMOST, a relatively inexpensive computational model. It was then further verified with the V/NCS model, which is much more expensive. Overall, our two-phase procedure showed a better goodness-of-fit than the straightforward employment of the Nelder-Mead algorithm, when only a limited number of simulation replications were allowed. In addition, in phase 2, performing local search along parameter space dimensions sequentially was more efficient than performing the search over all dimensions concurrently.The proposed two-phase re-calibration procedure is efficient at estimating parameters of computationally expensive stochastic dynamic disease models.

AB  - Life-sustaining treatment (LST) orders are important communication tools used to ensure preference-concordant care at the end of life. Recent studies reveal concerning rates of discordance between current preferences and documented LST orders, especially in nursing facilities without POLST. Reasons for discordance in facilities using POLST have been explored, however the majority of nursing facilities in the United States do not yet use the POLST form.Qualitative descriptive study using constant comparative analysis.Nursing facilities in Indiana (n = 6) not using POLST.Residents (n = 15) and surrogate decision-makers of residents without decisional capacity (n = 15) with discordance between current preferences and documented LST orders.Do not resuscitate, do not hospitalize (DNH), and do not intubate (DNI) orders were extracted from medical charts. Current preferences were elicited using the Respecting Choices Advanced Steps model. A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore reasons for discordance between current preferences and LST orders.Reasons for discordance included: (1) inadequate information about the range of available LST options, what each involves, and how to formally communicate preferences; (2) no previous discussion with facility staff; (3) no documentation of previously expressed preferences; and (4) family involvement.Reasons for discordance between expressed preferences and LST orders suggest that in facilities without a uniform and systematic LST order documentation strategy like POLST, these conversations may not occur and/or be documented. Staff should be aware that residents and surrogates may have preferences about LSTs that require strategic solicitation and documentation.

AB  - Objective: This research was undertaken to evaluate factors related to program retention among participants in a community-based peer recovery program for women of childbearing age with a history of substance use disorder. Methods: In all, 184 women of childbearing age with a history of substance use disorder were enrolled in a community-based peer recovery program. Half of the participants were pregnant or postpartum. The outcome of interest was retention in the program as measured at 2 and 6 months. Participants were paired with a peer recovery coach (PRC). PRCs were women with a personal history of substance use disorder who assisted with healthcare system navigation, facilitated access to local resources, and provided advice and emotional support. All PRCs were also licensed perinatal community health workers. Independent variables included gestational status, depression, anxiety, type and frequency of substance use, childhood trauma, abuse, readiness for treatment, and attachment patterns. Results: Anxiety was found to be a key factor associated with retention. Moderate anxiety was associated with higher rates of retention compared to normal to mild anxiety. Severe anxiety was associated with lower rates of retention compared to normal to mild anxiety. Attrition was highest in the first 2 months. Conclusions: Early integration with mental health services to address severe anxiety symptoms could potentially improve retention in substance use disorder recovery programs, thereby improving outcomes. More research is needed regarding severe anxiety and care-avoidant behaviors, particularly among women of childbearing age.

AB  - Background Incomplete communication between staff and providers may cause adverse outcomes for nursing home residents. The Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation (SBAR) tool is designed to improve communication around changes in condition (CIC). An adapted SBAR was developed for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project, OPTIMISTIC, to increase its use during a resident CIC and to improve documentation. Methods Four Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to develop and refine successive protocol implementation of the OPTIMISTIC SBAR were deployed in four Indiana nursing homes. Use of SBAR, documentation quality, and participant surveys were assessed pre- and post-intervention implementation. Results OPTIMISTIC SBAR use and documentation quality improved in three of the four buildings. Participants reported improved collaboration between nurses and providers after SBAR intervention. Conclusion Successive PDSA cycles implementing changes in an OPTIMISTIC SBAR protocol for resident CIC led to an increase in SBAR use, improved documentation, and better collaboration between nursing staff and providers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic introduced mandatory stay-at-home orders and concerns about contracting a virus that impacted the physical and mental health of much of the world's population. This study compared the rates of depression and anxiety in a sample of older primary care patients (aged ≥65 years old) and their family members recruited for a clinical trial before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were dyads enrolled in the Caregiver Outcomes of Alzheimer's Disease Screening (COADS) trial, which included 1,809 dyads of older primary care patients and one of their family members. Mean scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were measured and compared before and during the pandemic. We found no difference in depression and anxiety among dyads of older primary care patients and their family members recruited before and during COVID-19. Additionally, we found that older primary care patients and family members who reported their income as comfortable had significantly lower depression and anxiety compared to those who reported having not enough to make ends meet. Along with this, older primary care patients with a high school education or less were more likely to have anxiety compared to those with a postgraduate degree. Moreover, our findings support the notion that certain demographics of older primary care patients and family members are at a higher risk for depression and anxiety, indicating who should be targeted for psychological health interventions that can be adapted during COVID-19. Future research should continue monitoring older primary care patients and their family members through the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Widespread Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae immunization has decreased occult bacteremia and bacterial meningitis rates. Practice has evolved in pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) to favor fewer diagnostic tests for and empiric treatment of invasive bacterial infection. We lack evidence-based guidance on evaluation and treatment of unimmunized (UnI) or underimmunized (UnderI) febrile children. This study aims to determine how parental report of immunization status in febrile PED patients impacts rates of diagnostic testing, interventions, and hospital admissions.This is a retrospective cohort study with chart review of encounters of children aged 3 to 36 months presenting to an academic, tertiary care PED in 2019 using International Classification of Diseases-10 code for fever (R50.9). Inclusion criteria were documented fever of 38°C and higher and well appearance. Encounters were excluded if there was a history of chronic illness or documentation of ill appearance or hemodynamic instability. Encounters were grouped by provider-documented immunization status. Fischer exact test and logistic regression compared rates of diagnostic testing (serum, urine or cerebrospinal fluid laboratory studies, and chest radiographs), interventions (intravenous fluid bolus, intravenous antibiotic or steroid administration, respiratory support, or breathing treatment), and hospital admissions between UnderI, UnI, and fully immunized (FI) groups.Of the 1813 encounters reviewed, 1093 (60%) included provider-documented immunization status and 788 (43%) met final inclusion criteria: 23 (2.1%) UnI, 44 (5.8%) UnderI, and 721 (92.1%) FI. The UnderI and UnI children experienced significantly higher rates of laboratory evaluation including complete blood count and blood culture, medical intervention, and antibiotic prescriptions while in the PED. No significant differences were observed for rates of chest radiographs, hospital admissions, or 72-hour PED return visits.Higher rates of laboratory testing and interventions were observed in UnderI and UnI versus FI febrile patients at a PED, likely demonstrating increased clinical suspicion for invasive bacterial infection in this group despite lacking national guidelines. Given continued vaccine hesitancy, further studies are needed for guiding management of febrile UnI and UnderI children presenting for emergency care.

AB  - Abstract Healthcare systems are hampered by incomplete and fragmented patient health records. Record linkage is widely accepted as a solution to improve the quality and completeness of patient records. However, there does not exist a systematic approach for manually reviewing patient records to create gold standard record linkage data sets. We propose a robust framework for creating and evaluating manually reviewed gold standard data sets for measuring the performance of patient matching algorithms. Our 8-point approach covers data preprocessing, blocking, record adjudication, linkage evaluation, and reviewer characteristics. This framework can help record linkage method developers provide necessary transparency when creating and validating gold standard reference matching data sets. In turn, this transparency will support both the internal and external validity of recording linkage studies and improve the robustness of new record linkage strategies.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent mood episodes, affecting 1% to 2% of the population. Although its defining features are manic and hypomanic episodes, its course is dominated by depressive syndromes. Diagnosis can be challenging owing to symptom overlap with other disorders. Management goals include early and complete remission of acute episodes and the prevention of relapse between episodes. We present an overview of bipolar disorder and its subtypes, including algorithms and suggestions for screening, assessment, and treatment.

AB  - The number of benzodiazepine (BZD) prescriptions has substantially increased over the past decade, leading to a parallel rise in rates of misuse and overdose. These increases have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to update its "boxed warning" and have caused organizations to revisit prescribing guidelines. Concurrently, strong evidence from clinical trials supports the anxiolytic efficacy of BZDs. Although antidepressants and psychotherapy remain preferred treatments for chronic anxiety, BZDs remain helpful in treating acute or severe and persistent anxiety that does not respond to first-line therapy. Provider and patient education, coupled with prescribing surveillance, may be preferable to an overly stringent regulatory approach to guiding BZD use.

AB  - Abstract Background Hypoglycemia (HG) causes symptoms that can be fatal, and confers risk of dementia. Wearable devices can improve measurement and feedback to patients and clinicians about HG events and risk. Objectives The aim of the study is to determine whether vulnerable older adults could use wearables, and explore HG frequency over 2 weeks. Methods First, 10 participants with diabetes mellitus piloted a continuous glucometer, physical activity monitor, electronic medication bottles, and smartphones facilitating prompts about medications, behaviors, and symptoms. They reviewed graphs of glucose values, and were asked about the monitoring experience. Next, a larger sample (N = 70) wore glucometers and activity monitors, and used the smartphone and bottles, for 2 weeks. Participants provided feedback about the devices. Descriptive statistics summarized demographics, baseline experiences, behaviors, and HG. Results In the initial pilot, 10 patients aged 50 to 85 participated. Problems addressed included failure of the glucometer adhesive. Patients sought understanding of graphs, often requiring some assistance with interpretation. Among 70 patients in subsequent testing, 67% were African-American, 59% were women. Nearly one-fourth (23%) indicated that they never check their blood sugars. Previous HG was reported by 67%. In 2 weeks of monitoring, 73% had HG (glucose ≤70 mg/dL), and 42% had serious, clinically significant HG (glucose under 54 mg/dL). Eight patients with HG also had HG by home-based blood glucometry. Nearly a third of daytime prompts were unanswered. In 24% of participants, continuous glucometers became detached. Conclusion Continuous glucometry occurred for 2 weeks in an older vulnerable population, but devices posed wearability challenges. Most patients experienced HG, often serious in magnitude. This suggests important opportunities to improve wearability and decrease HG frequency among this population.

AB  - To explore to what extent intrauterine device (IUD) expulsion is associated with demographic and clinical risk factors.The APEX-IUD (Association of Perforation and Expulsion of IntraUterine Devices) study was a U.S. cohort study using electronic health records from three integrated health care systems (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Southern California, and Washington) and a health care information exchange (Regenstrief Institute). These analyses included individuals aged 50 years or younger with IUD insertions from 2001 to 2018. Intrauterine device expulsion cumulative incidence and incidence rates were estimated. Using Cox regression models, hazard ratios with 95% CIs were estimated before and after adjustment for risk factors of interest (age, race and ethnicity, parity, body mass index [BMI], heavy menstrual bleeding, and dysmenorrhea) and potential confounders.In total, 228,834 individuals with IUD insertion and no delivery in the previous 52 weeks were identified (184,733 [80.7%] with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system). Diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding-particularly a diagnosis in both recent and past periods-was the strongest risk factor for IUD expulsion. Categories with the highest risk of IUD expulsion within each risk factor included individuals diagnosed with overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity; those in younger age groups, especially among those aged 24 years or younger; and in those with parity of four or more. Non-Hispanic White individuals had the lowest incidence and risk, and after adjustment, Asian or Pacific Islander individuals had the highest risk. Dysmenorrhea was not independently associated with expulsion risk when adjusting for heavy menstrual bleeding.Most risk factors for expulsion identified in this study appear consistent with known physiologic factors that affect uterine anatomy and physiology (age, BMI, heavy menstrual bleeding, parity). The increased risk of IUD expulsion among individuals of color warrants further investigation. Intrauterine devices are an effective long-term contraceptive; expulsion is uncommon, but patients should be counseled accordingly.Bayer AG.EU PAS register, EUPAS33461.

AB  - People with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias and diabetes mellitus (ADRD-DM) are at high risk for hypoglycemic events. Their cognitive impairment and psychosocial situation often hinder detection of hypoglycemia. Extending use and benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to people with ADRD-DM could improve hypoglycemia detection, inform care, and reduce adverse events. However, cognitive impairment associated with ADRD presents unique challenges for CGM use. This commentary proposes applying the human-centered design process to CGM, investigating design solutions or interventions needed to integrate CGM into the health care of patients with ADRD-DM. With this process, we can identify and inform CGM designs for people with ADRD-DM, broadening CGM access, increasing detection and treatment of the silent threat posed by hypoglycemia.

AB  - Background Patients with hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) often make use of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) techniques to manage their chronic pain and other symptoms. Nevertheless, how they use CAM, which techniques they favor, and how CAM use affects their allopathic care remain unclear. The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand patients’ personal experiences with CAM and its role in their symptom management. Materials and methods Thirty individuals living with hEDS completed a brief online survey related to their CAM use. Thereafter, in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 of the survey respondents, qualitatively investigating their experiences with CAM. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Participants described massage therapy ( N = 21), medical cannabis ( N = 12), and mindfulness ( N = 13) as some of the most useful CAM modalities for managing symptoms related to hEDS, but they expressed a general interest in pursuing any treatment that could potentially reduce their chronic pain. They suggested an overall trust in CAM modalities and practitioners and ascribed greater empathy to CAM practitioners than to conventional medical providers. However, they also described a critical skepticism of CAM (and conventional) therapies and recounted instances of injury from such treatments. Conclusion Participants made extensive use of CAM therapies. They described both critical benefits as well as harms from the use of these non-conventional modalities. These results underscore the importance of clinicians maintaining communicative and compassionate relationships with their patients, and of an openness to the discussion and use of CAM treatments.

AB  - Synovial fluid is composed of hyaluronan and proteoglycan-4 (PRG4 or lubricin), which work synergistically to maintain joint lubrication. In diseases like osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and PRG4 concentrations can be altered, resulting in lowered synovial fluid viscosity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations within the synovial fluid increase. Synovial fibroblasts within the synovium are responsible for contributing to synovial fluid and can be targeted to improve endogenous production of hyaluronan and PRG4 and to alter the cytokine profile. We cyclically loaded SW982 synoviocytes to 0%, 5%, 10%, or 20% strain for three hours at 1 Hz. To assess the impact of substrate stiffness, we compared the 0% strain group to cells grown on tissue culture plastic. We measured the expression of hyaluronan turnover genes, hyaluronan localization within the cell layer, hyaluronan concentration, PRG4 concentration, and the cytokine profile within the media. Our results show that the addition of cyclic loading increased HAS3 expression, but not in a magnitude-dependent response. Hyaluronidase expression was impacted by strain magnitude, which is exemplified by the decrease in hyaluronan concentration due to cyclic loading. We also show that PRG4 concentration is increased at 5% strain, while higher strain magnitude decreases overall PRG4 concentration. Finally, 10% and 20% strain show a distinct, more pro-inflammatory cytokine profile when compared to the unloaded group. Multivariate analysis showed distinct separation between certain strain groups in being able to predict strain group, hyaluronan concentration, and PRG4 concentration from gene expression or cytokine concentration data, highlighting the complexity of the system. Overall, this study shows that cyclic loading can be used tool to modulate the endogenous production of hyaluronan, PRG4, and cytokines from synovial fibroblasts.

AB  - In-hospital resuscitation events have complex and enduring effects on clinicians, with implications for job satisfaction, performance, and burnout. Ethically ambiguous cases are associated with increased moral distress. We aim to quantitatively describe the multidisciplinary resuscitation experience.Multidisciplinary in-hospital healthcare professionals at an adult academic health center in the Midwestern United States completed surveys one and six weeks after a resuscitation event. Surveys included demographic data, task load (NASA-TLX), overall and moral distress, anxiety, depression, and spiritual peace. Spearman's rank correlation was computed to assess task load and distress.During the 5-month study period, the study included 12 resuscitation events across six inpatient units. Of 82 in-hospital healthcare professionals eligible for recruitment, 44 (53.7%) completed the one-week post-resuscitation event survey. Of those, 37 (84.1%) completed the six-week survey. Highest median task load burden at one week was seen for temporal demand, effort, and mental demand. Median moral distress scores were low, while "at peace" median scores tended to be high. There were no significant non-zero changes in task load or distress scores from weeks 1-6. Mental demand (r = 0.545, p < 0.001), physical demand (r = 0.464, p = 0.005), performance (r = -0.539, p < 0.001), and frustration (r = 0.545, p < 0.001) significantly correlated with overall distress. Performance (r = -0.371, p = 0.028) and frustration (r = 0.480, p = 0.004) also significantly correlated with moral distress.In-hospital healthcare professionals' experiences of resuscitation events are varied and complex. Aspects of task load burden including mental and physical demand, performance, and frustration contribute to overall and moral distress, deserving greater attention in clinical contexts.

AB  - Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer often experience high symptom burden, which is associated with heightened distress in both patients and their family caregivers. Few interventions have been tested to jointly address patient and caregiver symptoms in advanced gastrointestinal cancer. In a randomized pilot trial, telephone-based, dyadic acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) was found to be feasible in this population. The present secondary analyses examined the impact of this intervention on patient and caregiver physical and psychological symptoms. Patients and caregivers (N = 40 dyads) were recruited from clinics in Indianapolis, Indiana and randomized to either six weeks of telephone-based ACT or education/support, an attention control condition. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. Study group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. However, when examining within-group change, only ACT patients experienced moderate reductions in pain severity and interference at 2 weeks post-intervention (effect size [ES]=-0.47; -0.51) as well as moderate reductions in depressive symptoms at 2 weeks (ES=-0.42) and 3 months (ES=-0.41) post-intervention. ACT caregivers experienced moderate reductions in sleep disturbance (ES=-0.56; -0.49) and cognitive concerns (ES=-0.61; -0.85) across follow-ups. Additionally, caregivers in both conditions experienced moderate reductions in fatigue (ES=-0.38 to -0.70) and anxiety (ES=-0.40 to -0.49) across follow-ups. Findings suggest that ACT may improve certain symptoms in dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer and warrant replication in a larger trial.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted social support networks as well as resource access for participants. The purpose of this study was to: analyze the experiences of older adults enrolled in a geriatric-focused community health worker (CHW) support program, to gain a better understanding of how CHWs might enhance care delivery, and to further understand how COVID-19 affected the social and emotional needs and well-being of older adults during the first 18 months of the pandemic. Qualitative analysis was performed on notes entered by CHWs based on 793 telephone encounters with 358 participants between March 2020 and August 2021. Analysis was performed by two reviewers independently coding the data. Weighing the benefits of seeing family against the risks of COVID exposure was a source of emotional distress for participants. Our qualitative analysis suggests that CHWs were effective in providing emotional support and connecting participants to resources. CHWs are capable of bolstering the support networks of older adults and carrying out some of the responsibilities conventionally fulfilled by family supports. CHWs addressed participant needs that are frequently unmet by healthcare team members and provided emotional support to participants contributing to health and well-being. CHW assistance can fill gaps in support left by the healthcare system and family support structures.

AB  - To better understand and prioritize research on emergency care for Veterans, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Health Services Research and Development convened the 16th State of the Art Conference on VA Emergency Medicine (SAVE) in Winter 2022 with emergency clinicians, researchers, operational leaders, and additional stakeholders in attendance. Three specific areas of focus were identified including older Veterans, Veterans with mental health needs, and emergency care in the community (non-VA) settings. Among older Veterans, identified priorities included examination of variation in care and its impact on patient outcomes, utilization, and costs; quality of emergency department (ED) care transitions and strategies to improve them; impact of geriatric ED care improvement initiatives; and use of geriatric assessment tools in the ED. For Veterans with mental health needs, priorities included enhancing the reach of effective, multicomponent suicide prevention interventions; development and evaluation of interventions to manage substance use disorders; and identifying and examining safety and effective acute psychosis practices. Community (non-VA) emergency care priorities included examining changes in patterns of use and costs in VA and the community care settings as a result of recent policy and coverage changes (with an emphasis on modifiable factors); understanding quality, safety, and Veteran experience differences between VA and community settings; and better understanding follow-up needs among Veterans who received emergency care (or urgent care) and how well those needs are being coordinated, communicated, and met. Beyond these three groups, cross-cutting themes included the use of telehealth and implementation science to refine multicomponent interventions, care coordination, and data needs from both VA and non-VA sources. Findings from this conference will be disseminated through multiple mechanisms and contribute to future funding applications focused on improving Veteran health.

AB  - Abstract Background Data assessing protection conferred from COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection during Delta and Omicron predominance periods in the United States are limited. Methods This cohort study included persons ≥18 years who had ≥1 health care encounter across 4 health systems and had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before 26 August 2021. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection defined the exposure. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the Delta and Omicron periods; protection was calculated as (1−HR)×100%. Results Compared to unvaccinated and previously uninfected persons, during Delta predominance, protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations was high for those 2- or 3-dose vaccinated and previously infected, 3-dose vaccinated alone, and prior infection alone (range, 91%–97%, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals [CIs]); during Omicron predominance, estimates were lower (range, 77%–90%). Protection against COVID-19–associated emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters during Delta predominance was high for those exposure groups (range, 86%–93%); during Omicron predominance, protection remained high for those 3-dose vaccinated with or without a prior infection (76%; 95% CI = 67%–83% and 71%; 95% CI = 67%–73%, respectively). Conclusions COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provided protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and ED/UC encounters regardless of variant. Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination still provides protection against severe COVID-19 disease, regardless of prior infection.

Mean cough severity was 4.5 (scale 0-9). Chronic cough-related problems included embarrassment (66%), fatigue (56%), and anxiety or depression (49%). Testing was judged insufficient by 44%. Only 28% were satisfied with treatment; 20% reported abandoning treatment due to ineffectiveness. Interview themes (N = 30) included frustration with diagnostic uncertainty, and feelings of therapeutic futility. Some reported psychological distress. Work and socializing were commonly disrupted.Diagnostic uncertainty, perceived limitations of testing, and treatment failures suggest needs for better approaches to evaluating and treating chronic cough. Special attention to identifying and addressing mental health issues appears warranted.

AB  - Studies suggest Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) may slow the decline of memory function in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by regulating migroglial activation and oxidative stress within the brain's reticular activating system. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between delirium prevalence and being prescribed ACEI and ARB in participants admitted to the intensive care units (ICU).A secondary analysis of data from two parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trials was performed. ACEI and ARB exposure was defined as being prescribed an ACEI or an ARB within six months prior to the ICU admission. The primary endpoint was the first positive delirium assessment based on Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for up to thirty days.A total of 4791 patients admitted to the medical, surgical, and progressive ICU and screened for eligibility for the parent studies between February 2009 and January 2015 from two level 1 trauma and one safety net hospital in a large urban academic health system were included. Delirium rates in the ICU were not significantly different among participants with no exposure to ACEI/ARB (12.6%), or exposure to ACEI (14.4%), ARB (11.8%), or ACEI and ARB in combination (15.4%) in six months prior to the ICU admission. Exposure to ACEI (OR = 0.97[0.77, 1.22]), ARB (OR = 0.70 [0.47, 1.05]), or both (OR = 0.97 [0.33, 2.89]) in six months prior to ICU admission was not significantly associated with odds of delirium during the ICU admission after adjusting for age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and insurance status.While the impact of ACEI and ARB exposure prior to the ICU admission was not associated with the prevalence of delirium in this study, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of antihypertensive medications on delirium.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Informal (or family) caregivers to older adults with Alzheimer’s disease or other related dementias (ADRD) could greatly benefit from innovative telecaregiving systems that support caregiving from a distance. The objective of this review is to better understand (a) who is involved in telecaregiving and their experiences; (b) the interventions currently available to support ADRD telecaregiving; and (c) the outcomes measured to assess the effects of ADRD telecaregiving interventions. Research Design and Methods A mapping review was conducted by systematically searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO for all works published in English from 2002 to 2022. References of included publications were searched to identify additional empirical publications for inclusion. Results Sixty-one publications (describing 48 studies and 5 nonstudy sources) were included in the review. Currently available information on the demographics, experiences, challenges, and benefits of ADRD telecaregivers is summarized. We found that interventions to support telecaregiving could be classified into 7 categories of technological interventions and 3 categories of nontechnological interventions. Empirical studies on ADRD telecaregiving interventions investigated a variety of outcomes, the most prevalent being user experience. Discussion and Implications We conclude that (a) the paucity of literature on telecaregiving does not allow for a comprehensive understanding of the needs and day-to-day activities of ADRD telecaregivers; (b) interventions developed to support ADRD telecaregiving may not fully meet the needs of caregivers or care recipients; and (c) there is insufficient rigorous research establishing the effects of telecaregiving interventions on key ADRD-related outcomes.

AB  - Food insecurity affects nearly 50 million Americans and is linked to cardiovascular disease risk factors and health disparities. The purpose of this single-arm pilot study was to determine the feasibility of a 16-week dietitian-led lifestyle intervention to concurrently address food access, nutrition literacy, cooking skills, and hypertension among safety-net primary care adult patients. The Food Resources and Kitchen Skills (FoRKS) intervention provided nutrition education and support for hypertension self-management, group kitchen skills and cooking classes from a health center teaching kitchen, medically tailored home-delivered meals and meal kits, and a kitchen toolkit. Feasibility and process measures included class attendance rates and satisfaction and social support and self-efficacy toward healthy food behaviors. Outcome measures included food security, blood pressure, diet quality, and weight. Participants (n = 13) were on average {mean (SD)} aged 58.9 ± 4.5 years, 10 were female, and 12 were Black or African American. Attendance averaged 19 of 22 (87.1%) classes and satisfaction was rated as high. Food self-efficacy and food security improved, and blood pressure and weight declined. FoRKS is a promising intervention that warrants further evaluation for its potential to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors among adults with food insecurity and hypertension.

AB  - To understand the impact of the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic on sleep services within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs using separate surveys from "pre-COVID" and pandemic periods.Data from a pre-pandemic survey (September to November 2019) were combined with data from a pandemic-period survey (August to November 2020) to Veterans Affairs sleep medicine providers about their local sleep services within 140 Veterans Affairs facilities).A total of 67 (47.9%) facilities responded to the pandemic online survey. In-lab diagnostic and titration sleep studies were stopped at 91.1% of facilities during the pandemic; 76.5% of facilities resumed diagnostic studies and 60.8% resumed titration studies by the time of the second survey. Half of the facilities suspended home sleep testing; all facilities resumed these services. In-person positive airway pressure clinics were stopped at 76.3% of facilities; 46.7% resumed these clinics. Video telehealth was either available or in development at 86.6% of facilities and was considered a lasting addition to sleep services. Coronavirus disease-2019 transmission precautions occurred at high rates. Sleep personnel experienced high levels of stress, anxiety, fear, and burnout because of the pandemic and in response to unexpected changes in sleep medicine care delivery.Sleep medicine services within the Veterans Affairs evolved during the pandemic with many key services being interrupted, including in-lab studies and in-person positive airway pressure clinics. Expansion and initiation of telehealth sleep services occurred commonly. The pandemic adversely affected sleep medicine personnel as they sought to maintain access to care.

AB  - There is growing acknowledgement that advance directives alone have failed to have a major impact on end-of-life care. Sudore et al.1Sudore R.L. Fried T.R. Redefining the “planning” in advance care planning: preparing for end-of-life decision making.Ann Intern Med. 2010; 153: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar have made two major contributions that may increase the impact of advance care planning (ACP): 1) reframing ACP from a process of completing advance directives to a process of preparation and skill development and 2) conceptualizing ACP as a set of behaviors that can be best understood using behavior change theory, which proposes that people progress through several stages such as precontemplation before taking action on ACP-related tasks. In the present study, Sudore et al.2Sudore R.L. Knight S.J. McMahan R.D. et al.A novel website to prepare diverse older adults for decision making and advance care planning: a pilot study.J Pain Symptom Manage. 2014; 47: 674-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar used their framework to develop a novel, publicly available website called PREPARE, which addresses knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy for discrete ACP tasks such as choosing a surrogate. The website uses short videos to show rather than tell viewers how to engage in ACP tasks and takes into account key moderators of decision making such as health literacy and racial/ethnic diversity. The pilot test of the website involving 43 diverse older adults found that the program moved participants from precontemplation to higher behavior change stages but did not affect completion of ACP-related actions. This pilot demonstrates that the PREPARE website has potential to have high impact on the quality and frequency of end-of-life decision making. The lack of effect on action may be explained by the short follow-up of one week but also because successful ACP requires not only a ready patient or surrogate but also a system to facilitate ACP-related actions.3Hickman S.E.

AB  - Excellent palliative care can be provided with resources within the nursing home setting; however, we disagree with Dr Raider's characterization that this is the current default standard, and that hospice providers are somehow redundant or undermining quality nursing home care. In fact, one study of family members of deceased nursing home residents found that physicians failed to recognize and treat symptoms near the end of life, missed opportunities for advance care planning, and were not present enough in the nursing home to provide needed care. 1 Wetle T.

For those not familiar with nursing home care in the early 1980s, it was almost entirely long-term palliative care, as rehab was carried out in the hospital setting. There were no do-not-resuscitate regulations, as it seemed clearly futile to try to resuscitate nursing home patients. When a patient appeared to failing, usually from multiple comorbid cognitive and physical issues, measures were put in place to ensure a comfortable and dignified death. Full-Text PDF

In the current issue of Hypertension , Yang et al1 report on the presence of small conductance, calcium (Ca++)–activated potassium (K+) channels (SK channels) in a human adrenocortical cell line (H295R). SK channels were also found in normal human adrenals. Using pharmacological probes, these investigators showed relevance to synthesis of aldosterone: a specific SK channel inhibitor, apamin, increased expression of steroidogenic enzymes and increased both basal and angiotensin II–stimulated aldosterone production. 1-ethyl-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO), an agonist of SK channels, produced opposite effects. The authors suggest that a dysfunctional SK channel could decrease a restraining influence on secretion of aldosterone. Some degree of caution should be applied to the findings. There was a heavy reliance on nonbiological probes and the use of a human cell line (NIH-H295). Although a widely used source of adrenocortical cells, any cell line can lose certain functions over time. Replication by other laboratories will be important.

Produced in the adrenal zona glomerulosa, aldosterone is a potent sodium (Na+)–retaining, K+-secreting hormone. Angiotensin II and K+ stimulate its production to, respectively, maintain plasma volume and prevent hyperkalemia.2 Both stimuli act by first decreasing a highly polarized …

AB  - Background Obese black women enrolled in weight loss interventions experience 50% less weight reduction than obese white women. This suggests that current weight loss strategies may increase health disparities. Objective We evaluated the feasibility of identifying daily contextual factors that may influence obesity. Methods In-home interviews with 16 obese (body mass index ≥ 30) black and white urban poor women were performed. For 14 days, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was used to capture emotion and social interactions every other day, and day reconstruction method surveys were used the following day to reconstruct the context of the prior day's EMA. Results Factors included percentage of participants without weight scales (43.8%) or fitness equipment (68.8%) in the home and exposed to food at work (55.6%). The most frequently reported location, activity, and emotion were home (19.4 ± 8.53), working (7.1 ± 8.80), and happy (6.9 ± 10.03), respectively. Conclusion Identifying individual contexts may lead to valuable insights about obesogenic behaviors and new interventions to improve weight management.

AB  - This article refers to ‘Natriuretic peptide levels taken following unplanned admission to a cardiology department predict the duration of hospitalization’ by M. Asphaug et al., published in this issue on pages 1499–1505. Patients are not fractions. A 5% risk of death is not a 5% experience: what happens to an individual patient is different from the likelihood of outcomes across a population of people. Thus explaining risk to a single patient is a key clinical skill. Before risk can be explained, however, we first have to determine it. Risk-stratification tools are invaluable to the practicing physician. In the acute setting, risk stratification typically facilitates a single decision, such as admission or discharge from the emergency department, deciding whether or not to pursue further testing, or initiating more aggressive management. Ideally, risk stratification augments decision making, providing evidence-based criteria to help guide important clinical decisions. However, when used out of context, risk predictors can be misleading despite their value—akin to studying fish out of water. Trying to determine risk from an isolated marker outside of clinical context should only be performed with caution. In this issue of the Journal, Asphaug et al.1 demonstrate that elevated natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are associated with longer length of hospital stay (LOS) and all-cause mortality among patients admitted to a cardiology service. Their findings are consistent with a large body of evidence showing the tremendous prognostic power of NPs,2, 3 but the novelty of this study is their focus on LOS. Length of stay is a challenging endpoint in acute heart failure (HF) as no universal definition for when a patient is ‘ready for discharge’ exists.4 Issues such as convenience, rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility placement, or socioeconomic issues may keep a patient in the hospital longer than is medically necessary. While these issues may be less applicable to the population in this study than in the United States, they highlight the potential limitations of LOS as a clinical endpiont. Despite these limitations, LOS has importance to patients and clinicians, as those who stay in hospital longer are likely to be sicker. The authors hypothesized that NP levels would predict longer LOS. If correct, the value of this finding would depend on whether NP levels have value above and beyond other readily available prognostic information. Inevitably, clinicians will ask a corollary question: What can I do about it? If a patient is identified as high-risk, what can be done to mitigate this higher risk? Regardless, the first step is identification; concerns of next actions are irrelevant if we do not know who to target. As this is a retrospective analysis, the setting and rationale behind the study is critically important. In this single-centre administrative database study of 2978 patients with an unplanned admission to a cardiology ward, the aim was to identify a marker of longer LOS, irrespective of diagnosis: in essence, a test to separate the truly sick from the less sick. The authors hypothesized that NP values could be such a test. Thus, all patients with an unplanned cardiology admission who also had an NP value recorded were included. It is unclear whether the test was ordered for diagnostic purposes in patients with signs and symptoms of HF, although this could be assumed. However, the final primary discharge diagnosis was HF or cardiomyopathy in only 11%. Other diagnoses included arrhythmia (15%), hypertension (6%), airway infection (6%), angina pectoris or ischaemic heart disease (4%), and other (57%). Despite this broad context of multiple diagnoses, the authors found that NP levels retained their prognostic significance, supporting their contention that a single test may indeed provide a guidepost regarding hospital bed utilization. Enthusiasm for this potentially important finding must, however, be tempered with the limitations of the study, which are well-highlighted by the authors. Other variables relevant to risk assessment and management (except for age) were unknown in the database. Although the authors acknowledge the importance of other variables, such as diagnosis, aetiology, co-morbidities, gender, and laboratory values such as troponin or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), these were unaccounted for in their analysis. This makes it challenging to determine the independent value, if any, of NP levels. It is possible, perhaps even likely, that patients with elevated NP levels had worse vital signs, more co-morbidities, and lower eGFR and higher troponin levels. In the context of a single-centre study of patients with unplanned cardiology admission, varied diagnoses, and assumed appropriate testing and treatment, it is challenging to draw any firm conclusions about the value of isolated NP values. Even if potential confounders are disregarded, the value of NP levels was modest [area under the curve–receiver operating characteristic of 0.68] to predict patients with prolonged (>4 days) LOS.1 Despite the limitations of this study, the findings are supported by a robust body of evidence demonstrating the independent prognostic value of NPs.2 As important as the methodological limitations are the limitations of the applicability of the results. The authors emphasize NP levels should not be used clinically in isolation. Notably, the analysis was performed in relative isolation (there were no corrections for other predictors of outcome). In addition, only patients admitted to cardiology were included; thus these results should not be applied to other patient groups. As such, no conclusions can be drawn regarding NP values and need for admission, as no discharged patients were included. Ultimately, the authors highlight a key clinical question: given limited resources, who has the greatest need? In acute HF, we would argue a contrary perspective: the greater need is not identification of high risk, but lower risk.5 Nearly all acute HF patients are admitted. Multiple markers and risk instruments exist for hospitalized patients. Unnecessary hospitalization carries risks to patient safety, may lead to deconditioning, and even increase risk for post-discharge adverse events.6 Identifying patients safe for discharge directly from the emergency department or the hospital would conserve one of the most expensive resources in all of health care: staying in the hospital. Overall, the authors identify NP levels as a key candidate variable for future risk stratification tools or decision instruments in a broad spectrum of hospitalized cardiology patients. In general, an abnormal laboratory result, be it NPs, troponin, lactate, or creatinine, usually portends a worse prognosis than having normal results. What any single laboratory value adds to our ability to prognosticate, or what to do about it, is unclear unless placed in context.

AB  - ObjectiveTo extend an open source platform for measuring the qualityof electronic health data by adding functions useful for syndromicsurveillance.IntroductionNearly all of the myriad activities (or use cases) in clinical andpublic health (e.g., patient care, surveillance, community healthassessment, policy) involve generating, collecting, storing, analyzing,or sharing data about individual patients or populations. Effectiveclinical and public health practice in the twenty-first century requiresaccess to data from an increasing array of information systems,including but not limited to electronic health records. However, thequality of data in electronic health record systems can be poor or“unfit for use.” Therefore measuring and monitoring data quality isan essential activity for clinical and public health professionals aswell as researchers.MethodsUsing the Health Data Stewardship Framework1, we will extendAutomated Characterization of Health Information at Large-scaleLongitudinal Evidence Systems (ACHILLES), a software packagepublished open-source by the Observational Health Data Sciencesand Informatics collaborative (OHDSI; www.ohdsi.org) to measurethe quality of data electronically reported from disparate informationsystems. Our extensions will focus on analysis of data reportedelectronically to public health agencies for disease surveillance. Nextwe will apply the ACHILLES extensions to explore the quality ofdata captured from multiple real-world health systems, hospitals,laboratories, and clinics. We will further demonstrate the extendedsoftware to public health professionals, gathering feedback on theability of the methods and software tool to support public healthagencies’ efforts to routinely monitor the quality of data received forsurveillance of disease prevalence and burden.ResultsTo date we have mapped key surveillance data fields into theOHDSI common data model, and we have transformed 111 millionsyndromic surveillance message segments pertaining to 16.4 millionemergency department encounters representing 6 million patientsfor importation into ACHILLES. Using these data, we are exploringthe existing 167 metrics across 16 categories available withinACHILLES, including a person (e.g., number of unique persons);and observation period (e.g., Distribution of age at first observationperiod). Syndromic surveillance (SS), however, is driven largelyby monitoring patient stated chief complaints (non-standard freetext clinical data) in addition to coded diagnoses. Consequently,ACHILLES must be extended to maximally support use in analyzingSS datasets.ConclusionsThis work remains a work-in-progress. Over the coming year, wewill not only explore existing ACHILLES constructs using real-worldpublic health data but also introduce new functionality to explore1) patient demographics; 2) facility and location (e.g., emergencydepartment where care was delivered); and 3) clinical observations(e.g., chief complaint). The design and methods for examining theseaspects of surveillance data will be included on the poster, and theywill be made freely available for distribution with a future instance ofthe ACHILLES software. We ultimately envision these tools beingavailable for use on platforms such as the CDC’s Biosense – open toall local and state health agencies as a one-stop portal for surveillancedata analysis – or research environments where they can be used toexamine and improve the quality of data output from informaticssystems.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrate that age and receptiveness to new technologies tend to be negatively correlated. Using data from a sample of 311 nurses in a large teaching hospital in the midwestern United States, this study sought to determine whether age predicted satisfaction perceptions of infusion pump technology. Hierarchical regression indicated that the relationship between age and infusion pump satisfaction was not statistically significant, but it also revealed interesting moderation effects. When perceived support for infusion pump use was low, age was negatively related to infusion pump satisfaction. However, when perceived support was high, age was positively related to infusion pump satisfaction.

AB  - Muscle strength is essential but insufficient to reduce ADL disability in older adults. A parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare whether adding functional and task-oriented training to resistance exercise would generate a greater improvement on ADL performance relative to resistance exercise alone. Fifty-two older adults who showed muscle weakness, lived a sedentary life style, and had ADL difficulty were recruited from local subsidized housing properties. They received 10 weeks of resistance exercise or the 3-Step Workout for Life, which included practicing functional movements and ADL tasks at home in addition to resistance exercise. The Box and Blocks test, Timed Up and Go, and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills were used to measure physical function and ADL performance. At six-month follow-up, all three outcomes in the 3-Step Workout for Life group were not different from the baseline while the resistance exercise only group showed a significant decline (mean change in the Box and Blocks = -4.05, p = 0.02; mean change in the Timed Up and Go = 1.84, p = 0.01; mean change in the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills = -0.25, p = 0.01). More importantly, the 3-Step Workout for Life group showed a greater improvement in ADL performance when compared to the resistance exercise only group (group mean difference = 0.37, p < 0.01). Adding functional, task-oriented training to resistance exercise may help retain physical function and delay the decline of ADL performance after six months of detraining in vulnerable older adults.

AB  - Background The Institute of Medicine has highlighted unequal treatment for African American individuals in health care. We examined the association of underuse of antidepressants in African American individuals with increased mortality. Methods We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in Metropolitan St Louis, Missouri, in a population-based study of community-dwelling African American individuals, aged 52 to 68 years. Medication evaluations and clinically relevant levels of depressive symptoms (CRLDS) assessments occurred in 2000 and 2004. The analytic sample included 830 (of 853 total, 97%) participants with complete data. CRLDS was defined as ≥9 on the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Antidepressant use was determined by in-home medication recording and in-center coding. Participants were placed into 4 exposure categories: persistent CRLDS–no antidepressant (n = 69); intermittent CRLDS–no antidepressant (n = 123); antidepressant treatment (n = 110); and no CRLDS–no antidepressant (n = 528). Logistic regression with backwards elimination of the 9 identified potential confounders was used to examine associations of exposures with all-cause mortality over 6 years (2004–2010). Five sensitivity analyses investigated robustness of the primary findings. Results The antidepressant group was independently associated with reduced mortality compared with the persistent–no antidepressant group (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08–0.44). Sensitivity analyses showed no substantive differences from the primary model; one indicated that the persistent CRLDS–no antidepressant group experienced significantly increased mortality compared with the no CRLDS–no antidepressant group (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.10–4.09), whereas the intermittent–no antidepressant group did not (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44–1.58). Conclusions These results highlight that underuse of antidepressants in African American individuals is associated with increased mortality.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke are conditions of interest to public health as they can result in long-term outcomes and disabilities. Specialized registries can facilitate public health surveillance, however only 4% of hospitals in the United States actively engage in electronic reporting to these registries. We leveraged electronic claims and clinical data from a health information exchange to create a statewide TBI/SCI/Stroke registry to facilitate the study of long-term outcomes and health services utilization. The registry contains 109,943 TBI patients, 9,027 SCI patients and 117,084 stroke patients with a mean of 3 years of follow-up data after injury. Additionally, the registry contains data on individual patient encounters, prescriptions and clinical variables. The high-dimensional data with large sample sizes may present a valuable informatics resource for injury research as well as public health surveillance.

AB  - The term comparative effectiveness research (CER) took center stage with passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009). The companion US$1.1 billion in funding prompted the launch of initiatives to train the scientific workforce capable of conducting and using CER. Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) focused these initiatives on patients, coining the term ‘patient-centered outcomes research’ (PCOR). Educational and training initiatives were soon launched. This report describes the initiative of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America (PhRMA) Foundation. Through provision of grant funding to six academic Centers of Excellence, to spearheading and sponsoring three national conferences, the PhRMA Foundation has made significant contributions to creation of the scientific workforce that conducts and uses CER/PCOR.

AB  - ObjectiveTo extend an open source analytics and visualization platform for measuring the quality of electronic health data transmitted to syndromic surveillance systems.IntroductionEffective clinical and public health practice in the twenty-first century requires access to data from an increasing array of information systems. However, the quality of data in these systems can be poor or “unfit for use.” Therefore measuring and monitoring data quality is an essential activity for clinical and public health professionals as well as researchers1. Current methods for examining data quality largely rely on manual queries and processes conducted by epidemiologists. Better, automated tools for examining data quality are desired by the surveillance community.MethodsUsing the existing, open-source platform Atlas developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics collaborative (OHDSI; www.ohdsi.org), we added new functionality to measure and visualize the quality of data electronically reported from disparate information systems. Our extensions focused on analysis of data reported electronically to public health agencies for disease surveillance. Specifically, we created methods for examining the completeness and timeliness of data reported as well as the information entropy of the data within syndromic surveillance messages sent from emergency department information systems.ResultsTo date we transformed 111 million syndromic surveillance message segments pertaining to 16.4 million emergency department encounters representing 6 million patients into the OHDSI common data model. We further measured completeness, timeliness and entropy of the syndromic surveillance data. In Figure-1, the OHDSI tool Atlas summarizes the analysis of data completeness for key fields in over one million syndromic surveillance messages sent to Indiana’s health department in 2014. Completeness is reported by age category (e.g., 0-10, 20-30, 60+). Gender is generally complete, but both race and ethnicity fields are often complete for less than half of the patients in the cohort. These results suggest areas for improvement with respect to data quality that could be actionable by the syndromic surveillance coordinator at the state health department.ConclusionsOur project remains a work-in-progress. While functions that assess completeness, timeliness and entropy are complete, there may be other functions important to public health that need to be developed. We are currently soliciting feedback from syndromic surveillance stakeholders to gather ideas for what other functions would be useful to epidemiologists. Suggestions could be developed into functions over the next year. We are further working with the OHDSI collaborative to distribute the Atlas enhancements to other platforms, including the National Syndromic Surveillance Platform (NSSP). Our goal is to enable epidemiologists to quickly analyze data quality at scale.References1. Dixon BE, Rosenman M, Xia Y, Grannis SJ.

AB  - Objective: We demonstrate an architecture for driving regional public health decisions with automated and semi-automated data collected from open source point of care systems in resource constrained environments.Introduction: Ministries of Health in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) are making or trying to make public health decisions for infectious disease conditions like HIV using data garnered from sentinel events and disease tracking in the community. The process of gathering and aggregating data for these case-based reports for is, in all too often a cumbersome or paper-based process. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) was interested in prototyping and piloting approaches that could improve the efficiency and reliability of case reports in resource-constrained environments. One of their primary goals was to demonstrate how electronic data gathered in the front lines of care could be leveraged to automate and improve the reliability of data within case reports driving public health decisions at regional and country levels. OpenMRS is an open source medical record system platform often used in resource constrained environments.1 Since OpenMRS is used as an electronic medical record system in several African countries and has been connected to regional or country-level health exchanges, the CDC was interested in building a working solution for electronic case based reporting using OpenMRS and a health information exchange.Methods: Working closely with the CDC, we developed a Case-Based Reporting (CBR) module for OpenMRS, using HIV as an initial use case. Trigger events were defined based on sentinel events and key clinical monitoring conditions and these were mapped or added to standard terminologies. We use Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging standards to deliver case reports from OpenMRS to the health information exchange.2 We used existing manual workflows and EPI officers to define the needs for a surveillance officer role and the requirements for the CBR module. The module was developed as open source using agile methodologies. OpenHIE (ohie.org) was selected to demonstrate the ability of OpenMRS module to submit an electronic case report to a health information exchange.Results: We have a working, open source case-based surveillance module for OpenMRS that comes with nine pre-defined HIV-specific triggers:● New Case● New Disease● New Treatment● Evidence of Lack of Monitoring● Evidence of Treatment Failure● Switched to Second Line Regimen● Treatment Stopped● Lost to Follow Up● Patient DiedWe have been able to demonstrate the automatic creation of HIV-based case reports based on data within an electronic medical record system, placement of these proposed case reports into a work queue for a surveillance officer, and successful electronic submission of these case reports into a health information exchange.Conclusions: This work demonstrates the ability to develop open source point of care software solutions for LMIC that can be used for sentinel awareness as well as longitudinal monitoring of individual patient care. The current scenarios, trigger identification standards, and messaging specifications are easily accessible and published on the OpenMRS Wiki.3Our incorporation of user centered design through EPI officer engagement helped ensure that our solution is responsive to the end user. The CDC is able to use this solution to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating electronic case reporting in LMICs and to demonstrate the benefits and promote the adoption of electronic medical record systems and health information exchanges in resource constrained environments. In the next phase of this work, we will be working with the CDC to identify sites within Africa for deployment and refinement of the CBR module.

AB  - Incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) were estimated.Study data were from a large administrative claims database. Individuals aged 18 years or older enrolled in tracked health plans for 12 months from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, and with an International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for "polycystic kidney, autosomal dominant" (753.13) or for "polycystic kidney, unspecified type" (753.12) were identified as having ADPKD, and linked one-to-one with individuals without ADPKD based on age and gender. Zero-inflated negative binomial models estimated incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures, adjusting for risk factors.A total of 3,844 individuals with ADPKD who satisfied selection criteria were linked one-to-one with 3,844 individuals without ADPKD. Multivariate, regression models adjusting for risk factors revealed incremental mean (standard error) resource use associated with ADPKD of 0.68 (0.090) hospital days, equal to 68 additional hospital days per 100 ADPKD patients, and 6.9 (0.28) outpatient visits, equal to 690 additional visits per 100 ADPKD patients. Mean (standard error) incremental total expenditures associated with ADPKD were US$8,639 ($470). Mean incremental expenditures were largest for outpatient expenditures at US$4,918 ($198), followed by mean incremental hospital expenditures of US$2,603 ($263), and mean incremental medication expenditures of US$1,589 ($77). Based on sub-group analysis, mean incremental total expenditures were US$2,944 ($417) among ADPKD patients without end-stage renal disease and US$38,962 ($6,181) for those with end-stage renal disease.ADPKD was associated with considerable incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures. Significant illness burden was found even before patients reached end-stage renal disease.

AB  - The National Academy of Medicine and others promote interventional research to reduce older adults’ use of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications with anticholinergic effects. The Indiana University Brain Health Patient Safety Laboratory performed a study to develop and test a mobile software application to intervene on older adults’ anticholinergic medication use. In the first study phase, we performed qualitative research interviews (n=24), in-store shopper observations (n=39), and laboratory-based simulated OTC shopping tasks (n=21). This phase produced a dual-process conceptual model of OTC medication purchase and use, separating habit-based and deliberation-based decision-making processes. Based on this model, we iteratively developed and usability tested Brain Buddy, a mobile app intended to: increase awareness through videos and articles; support decision making through decision aid and risk scoring features; and assist users to have a conversation with their prescriber or pharmacist. A pilot of Brain Buddy’s effect on older outpatients’ behavior is currently underway.

AB  - This editorial comments on the article by Ouslander et al. In this issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Ouslander and colleagues describe results from an analysis of thousands of short-term changes in status that occurred in nursing facilities that participated in a randomized controlled trial testing the INTERACT program (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers).1 Both intervention group facilities (n = 55) and control group facilities (n = 78) submitted descriptions of changes in condition using a structured tool, with a range of 1 to 322 changes in condition reported by facilities. To provide insight into how changes in condition are treated in the nursing facility, facilities in the study were asked to report on a sample of episodes of changes (1) for which a nurse completed an INTERACT SBAR tool (Situation-Background-Assessment/Appearance Request/Review) and (2) that did not result in a hospital transfer in the first 72 hours after the change. The article provides a description of the range of presentation of changes in condition of nursing facility residents, as well as an analysis of which symptoms are associated with hospital transfers between 72 hours and 7 days. This study provides an important window into changes in condition of residents that were largely successfully managed in the nursing facility setting. The body of literature, centered on reduction of hospital transfers of nursing facility residents, often relies on hospitalization claims data and on other data collected on transferred residents. Changes of condition that are evaluated and managed in the nursing facility are much harder to capture, representing “nonevents” in terms of transfers. As hospitalization rates decrease2 in the context of increased motivation to provide care in place,3 close attention must be paid to the clinical care and resources available in the nursing facility setting. Judging hospital transfers as “potentially avoidable” based on the diagnosis arrived at after hospitalization (ie, Medicare claims data) is a strategy that makes sense in terms of access to data that can be used to generate national trends and compare outcomes across facilities. It is limited, however, because of missing the complexity of the initial presentation of the resident in the nursing facility, which is when intervention is needed to prevent a transfer. For the 10% of residents who were initially managed in the facility and then transferred to the hospital, the diagnoses of these hospitalizations often appeared unrelated to the inciting change in condition event from the nursing facility. Ouslander and colleagues' findings emphasize the complexity of presentation of acute illness of nursing facility residents, as do the findings of a recently published study of changes in condition that did result in hospital transfers.4 Most of 7689 changes in condition that were reported by facility staff in this study involved multiple symptoms that were not disease specific. The authors note that this is consistent with the often atypical presentations of acute illness seen in geriatric patients, as well as the multimorbidity of the nursing facility population. These findings underscore the need for caution in the use of disease-specific pathways that could inappropriately narrow the diagnoses considered when a resident becomes ill. They also highlight the need for a careful clinical evaluation for changes in condition. The SBAR, a key component of the INTERACT program, is a useful tool for facilitating provider-nurse communication during a short-term change in condition and has been shown to improve communication. A few studies have even linked use of the SBAR to improved patient outcomes.5, 6 The requirement in this study of SBAR use for recording a change in condition event may have prevented reporting of change in condition events with either low acuity or very high acuity. This may skew the data in either direction. More study of SBAR use, specifically as it relates to resident outcomes and factors that contribute to using the SBAR, may yield more information about the application of this tool in the skilled nursing facility setting. Interventions to reduce hospital transfers of nursing facility residents that have had promising or positive results include multiple components to address the clinical complexity of the population. Examples of such resource-intensive interventions can be found in the ongoing national clinical demonstration projects of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Initiative to Reduce Hospitalizations of Long Stay Nursing Facility Residents. These projects include embedded staff in facilities in a specialized role. The different sites in the project use a variety of approaches to enhance nursing care, optimize communication among stakeholders, improve medical provider assessment and care, and integrate resident and family goals for treatment.7-9 The authors note limitations to their study, including the nonrandomized reporting on these events by nursing facility staff. Furthermore, changes in condition of short- and long-stay nursing home residents are not compared and there may be important differences in the presentation of illness in residents who were recently hospitalized. Patients recently hospitalized are at greater risk for transferring back to the hospital from skilled nursing facilities.10 Overall, this study presents a significant contribution to our understanding of short-term changes in condition events in nursing facilities. Recognition of the complexities of caring for nursing facility residents with multiple comorbidities must be woven into any program designed to reduce avoidable hospitalizations of these individuals. As nursing facility leaders and medical providers strategize ways to avoid being penalized for hospital readmissions and reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers, studies such as this one will be key to identifying tactics to safely keep and treat residents in place in facilities. Drs. Unroe and Carnahan are both investigators on the OPTIMISTIC (Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care) demonstration project, which is funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Funding Opportunity 1E1CMS331488). The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the view of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

AB  - Background: ECLIPSE (Evaluation of a Peer Coach-Led Intervention to Improve Pain Symptoms) is a randomized controlled trial testing peer-supported chronic pain self-management. Veterans are paired with a peer coach (also with chronic pain) for 6 months. Peer coaches (PCs) and veterans meet or talk by phone 2x/month about pain self-management strategies, and veterans receive motivation and encouragement from their PC. To determine if the intervention was delivered as intended, fidelity was assessed at the end of the intervention period. Fidelity assessment is vital to help understand reasons for an intervention’s success or failure. &#x0D; Methods: Intervention veterans were asked about the intervention’s delivery during their 6-month assessment, after intervention completion. Presence or absence of four “essential elements” of the intervention were evaluated, as well as meeting frequency. &#x0D; Results: Scoring of veteran assessments revealed 74% of PC’s discussed self-management strategies and 69% of veterans felt motivated by their PC. Only 52% discussed how to adjust strategies and 34% discussed goal-setting. PC-veteran meeting frequency varied: 16% met weekly, 21% met twice a month, 16% met once a month, and 46% met less than once a month. 47% of PC’s had greater than 75% fidelity (i.e., the presence of at least 3 of 4 elements described above). &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: About half of PC’s delivered the intervention with at least 75% fidelity. Fidelity was greater for discussing self-management strategies and motivating veterans. Results suggest that peer-supported self-management can be delivered with fidelity but PCs may need additional training to do so consistently.

AB  - Background &#x0D; The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, &amp; Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) demonstration project, tasked with reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations of nursing home residents. OPTIMISTIC-enrolled nursing homes are reimbursed by CMS for treating residents with pneumonia in place. The purpose of this study is to examine the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of episodes of pneumonia in OPTIMISTIC nursing homes. &#x0D; Project Methods &#x0D; This case series uses data from nursing home medical records of the seven facilities with the highest pneumonia caseload identified from the OPTIMISTIC database. Cases are from billing episodes spanning November 2017 through April 2018. Within each facility, cases of pneumonia were randomly selected for inclusion. Data were entered into an extraction tool designed by the study team. &#x0D; Results &#x0D; Data were extracted from 41 records of unique patients. Despite CMS reimbursing for a maximum of 7 days for treatment of pneumonia, 78.0% of patients were monitored beyond that time and with greater attention than usual care. Of all 41 patients treated with antibiotics, 53.7% were given a fluoroquinolone and 24.4% were given amoxicillin/clavulanate. CURB-65 scores showed 58.3% scored in a range recommending hospitalization. Most patients (87.8%) were stabilized in the nursing home; three (7.3%) were hospitalized, one (2.4%) transferred to hospice, and one (2.4%) died. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact &#x0D; OPTIMISTIC-affiliated nursing facilities successfully provide enhanced care for most patients diagnosed with pneumonia in the facilities. Given the high incidence of fluoroquinolone use, one area for improvement is reduction of this medication contraindicated in the elderly.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis: &#x0D; This study examines the role access to information and knowledge in acute stroke care following a 2011 stroke quality improvement clustered randomized trial and a national acute ischemic stroke (AIS) directive in the Veterans Health Administration. Access to information is associated with the highest levels of acute stroke care provision, as well as other key organizational features. &#x0D; Experimental Design or Project Methods: &#x0D; A multidisciplinary team analyzed and conducted semistructured interviews of clinical providers across 11 VAMCs over a 3-year period. The interviews were then coded and analyzed using a mix methods approach. This study focused on the “Access to Information and Knowledge” organization feature defined in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs. &#x0D; Results: &#x0D; The manifestations of this organizational feature include: stroke binders, intranet share-points, pocket cards, algorithms, checklists, templates, stroke kits, flow sheets, care maps, posters, and room signs. Acute stroke is a low-volume, high stakes, time sensitive condition at these sites. Therefore, proper access to information is especially important to ensure a continuity of care that transcends the idiosyncrasies of individual providers allowing for quick, correct, and complete care of the patient. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: &#x0D; The mere presence of certain tools in a clinical setting is not enough, but rather the feature relies on getting the right information, to the right people, at the right time. Access to information exemplifies the need for implementation science, and insights from this study can be broadly applied to a plethora of scenarios in other clinical settings.

AB  - Background &#x0D; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent among Veterans. Patients with COPD commonly experience dyspnea, which can be debilitating and may limit daily activities leading to a reduced quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation often includes teaching pursed lip breathing as a method to reduce dyspnea. However, patients with COPD, including Veterans, have limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation due to transportation constraints and lack of referrals by physicians. &#x0D; Methods &#x0D; MELodica Orchestra for DYspnea (MELODY) is a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a music-based approach to teach pursed lip breathing to Veterans with COPD experiencing dyspnea. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the intervention group, education only control group, and usual care control group using block randomization. Patients in the intervention group will meet twice weekly over twelve weeks for instruction on how to play the melodica and to participate in group music-making. The program also includes education about COPD, pursed lip breathing, tobacco cessation, and other relevant topics. Each participant will receive quantitative assessments (e.g., exercise endurance and dyspnea scales) and participate in qualitative interviews. &#x0D; Anticipated Results &#x0D; We expect the intervention to be safe and feasible. We hypothesize that patients in the intervention group will achieve the greatest reduction in dyspnea compared with patients in either control group. &#x0D; Potential Impact &#x0D; If pilot data demonstrates efficacy, then a multiple-site randomized control trial will be conducted with intent to introduce the program into routine clinical practice.

AB  - Background: &#x0D; Among Veterans, homelessness is a well-recognized, major problem. Approximately 20% of homeless persons in Indianapolis are Veterans. The Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans Program provides residential care for housing insecure Veterans with multiple needs. However, difficulty in combating issues of isolation and lack of avocation for members of the Program remains. Our goal and belief is that providing veterans with a participatory arts will significantly improve their quality of life and reintegration into the community. &#x0D; Methods: &#x0D; This prospective study will use mixed methods to compare intervention participants with usual care controls. Veterans will complete standardized measures including the 20-Item Short Form Health Survey, for quality of life, and Flow State Scale-2, for level of program engagement. Veterans who transition to community housing will complete the Military to Civilian Questionnaire. Veterans will also participate in semi-structured interviews for qualitative data. &#x0D; Anticipated Results: &#x0D; We anticipate that quality of life will improve among homeless Veterans who participate in the study compared to usual care controls. Further, that we will observe a higher level of community reintegration for participants who leave the Domiciliary. &#x0D; Significance: &#x0D; Offering an intervention that looks to change how Veterans see themselves in specific social roles and change how they structure their lives is vital in tackling issues contributing to homelessness. &#x0D; Potential Impact: &#x0D; This project will provide preliminary data about a participatory music program regarding improvement in quality of life for Veterans with housing insecurity. Findings can be used to build a larger implementation trial across VA domiciliaries nation-wide.

AB  - &#x0D; Background: Indiana is ranked 43/50 for infant mortality in America. WeCare employs lay Community Health Coaches (CHCs) to promote positive behavioral changes in pregnant, postpartum and women of child-bearing age living in low-income, high-risk communities in order to reduce the risk of infant mortality. Infant mortality can be reduced in communities where birth spacing and family planning education are available. &#x0D; Project Methods: The goal was to address the knowledge gaps in patient handouts and CHC training regarding birth spacing and family planning. Through extensive literature searches, case conferences with CHCs, and review of current training materials, five gaps in training were identified: (1) comprehensive knowledge of rapid repeat pregnancies (2) resources regarding contraceptive methods (3) contraceptive counseling in the antenatal and postpartum periods (4) joint decision-making models and (5) father involvement in family planning. &#x0D; Results: With comprehensive literature reviews and collaboration with fellow WeCare members, the gaps in training were appropriately filled. The WeCare training manual for CHCs is updated with information regarding birth spacing and family planning, as well as with counseling techniques for contraceptive method decision-making. A gap in existing literature regarding father involvement in family planning was identified. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: By enhancing CHC education on birth spacing, family planning, and counseling techniques, we may begin to close the knowledge gap for women in low-income, high-risk populations. This has the potential to reduce the rate of rapid repeat pregnancies and unintended pregnancies. We have also opened a new avenue of research about father involvement in family planning in the US.

AB  - BACKGROUND &#x0D; Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality is increasing in persons ˂ 50 years old. Intervals between symptom onset and initial presentation (presentation interval [PI]) and between initial presentation and diagnosis (diagnosis interval [DI]) are not well-quantified. &#x0D; OBJECTIVE &#x0D; Compare PI and DI between early-onset CRC (EOCRC) and persons &gt;50, and identify factors affecting these intervals. &#x0D; METHODS &#x0D; In this retrospective VA-based case-control study, we identified EOCRC cases from an ongoing study and compared them to controls (CRC patients aged ≥ 50 years). We abstracted demographics, clinical features, CRC location and stage, PI, and DI. Mann-Whitney tests compared mean and median PI and DI. &#x0D; RESULTS &#x0D; Advanced stage (III-IV) CRC was more common among the 240 EOCRC patients (mean age: 45.2, 60.8% White) than in the 234 controls (mean age: 63.8, 71.8% White): 55.4% vs 43.5%; P= 0.015. PIs and DIs, respectively, were present for 153(63.8%) and 222(92.5%) of cases and for 74(31.6%) 222(94.9%) of controls. No difference was found between median PI in EOCRC and late-onset CRC patients (42 vs 60 days, P= 0.68). The EOCRC cases had a significantly shorter median DI (41 [IQR = 16-83] vs 71 days [IQR = 32-145], P&lt;0.0001). &#x0D; CONCLUSIONS &#x0D; In this retrospective study, younger patients had more advanced stage CRC at diagnosis than their older counterparts. However, contrary to published data, median time to diagnosis was shorter in those &lt; 50 years. Factors associated with the DI are forthcoming. Candidate factors include race, diagnosis year, presenting symptoms, type of initial provider, CRC stage, and CRC location.

AB  - Evidence suggests that health information exchange (HIE) is an effective strategy to improve efficiency and quality of care, as well as reduce costs. A complex patchwork of federal and state legislation has developed over time to encourage HIE activity. Hospitals and health systems have adopted various HIE models to meet the requirements of these statutes and regulations. Given the complexity of HIE laws, it is important to understand how these legal levers influence HIE engagement. We combined data from two unique data sources to examine the association between state-level HIE laws and hospital engagement in community HIEs. Our results identified three legal provisions of state laws (HIE authorization, financial & non-financial incentives, opt-out consent) that increased the likelihood of community HIE engagement. Other provisions decreased the likelihood of engagement. This analysis provides foundational evidence about the utility of HIE laws. More research is needed to determine causal relationships.

AB  - ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to review the extant literature for evidence on the validity of ICD-9-CM and -10-CM codes for the purpose of identifying cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.IntroductionAdministrative data refers to data generated during the processes of health care. These data are a rich source of patient health information, including diagnoses and problem lists, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and medications. Established standards are used to code each data into the appropriate coding systems. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes are the coding standard for diagnoses and have been frequently used to identify cases for the creation of cohorts in examining care delivery, screening, prevalence, and risk factors1,2. However, while some studies have assessed the validity and reliability of ICD-CM codes to identify various conditions such as cerebral palsy and rheumatoid arthritis3,4, the evidence for using ICD codes to accurately identify sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases is largely unexamined. The purpose of this study is to review the extant literature for evidence on the validity of ICD codes for identifying cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Our findings will inform efforts to improve the use of administrative data for STI-related health service and surveillance researches.MethodsOur systematic review followed a protocol consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We comprehensively searched PubMed and Scopus databases for peer-reviewed articles published before February 2018. Articles were identified with search terms related to our STIs of interest (chlamydia, syphilis or gonorrhea), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), administrative codes, and validation studies. PID was included as 33%-50% of PID cases are due to chlamydia or gonorrhea5. Only empirical publications appearing in peer-reviewed English language journals were included. Further, we excluded articles classified as letters to the editor, policy briefs, perspectives, commentaries, summaries of future research plans, and grey literature. Additionally, articles without abstracts were also excluded. The screening process used by our review is outlined in Figure 1. Briefly, all articles were subjected to a two-step screening process. First, we reviewed articles based on title and abstract. We eliminated studies that did not focus on STIs or on validation in the context of STIs. Articles were included if they focused on any combination of the STIs of interest, or on PID, and were validation studies on diagnostic testing or administrative codes. Second, selected articles were then reviewed in full to identify studies which included the STIs of interest, assessed and listed ICD-9-CM or -10-CM codes, and measured validity. The snowball technique was used on included articles, whereby we reviewed all references found in the references of the included articles.ResultsOur search strategy identified 1,754 articles to be screened by title and abstract. Of these, only five (0.29%) articles met the initial inclusion criteria. After full text review, only two articles6,7 met the final inclusion criteria to be included in the systematic review. Both articles focused on PID with no assessment of syphilis. They utilized ICD-9-CM codes to identify cases with PID and performed chart reviews to determine true PID status. Results of both articles found positive predictive value (PPV) of PID to be between 18%–79%. Only one article7 examined the PPV of chlamydia (56%; 5/9 cases) and gonorrhea (100%; 4/4 cases) separately.ConclusionsWe identified just two studies that evaluated the validity of ICD codes in identifying the STIs of interest. Both studies focused on PID cases in which chlamydia and gonorrhea diagnoses and tests might be documented. Additionally, since both studies were published before 2015, neither evaluates the use of administrative data following the U.S. transition to ICD-10 codes. Given these findings, further studies are required to examine the predictive value of ICD-9 and -10 codes for all three diseases in the general population.References1. Tao G, Zhang CX.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis: A prediction model utilizing the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program risk calculator for serious complications (NSQIPSC) and measures of cognitive function has been demonstrated to predict postoperative delirium incidence and severity in patients after non-cardiac surgery. The next step is to test this model’s generalizability by validating in different patient populations and evaluating the robustness of the model with and without parameters of cognition. We hypothesized that the prediction model would still function in predicting postoperative delirium in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery.&#x0D; Experimental Design or Project Methods: A secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 135 individuals who underwent major thoracic surgery from October 2013 to June 2015 was done. Delirium incidence and severity were tracked postoperatively through the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Delirium Rating Scale-R-98 (DRS), respectively. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used to assess preoperative cognition. Linear regressions and specificity/sensitivity calculations were performed to evaluate the model.&#x0D; Results: One hundred and thirty-two patients with a mean age of 59±13 years, 33/132 CAM-ICU+, and a mean DRS peak of 3.12±3.43 were analyzed. Linear regression of NSQIP-SC scores moderately predicted delirium severity (P&lt;0.001, Adjusted R2: 0.28). Addition of a cognitive measure did not significantly improve the model (P&lt;0.001, Adjusted R2: 0.29). NSQIP-SC moderately predicted delirium incidence (sensitivity: 60.61%, specificity: 68.69%, AUROC: 0.73). Addition of a cognitive measure (sensitivity: 61.54%, specificity: 68.69%, AUROC: 0.73) did not significantly improve the model. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: NSQIP-SC was a predictor variable for delirium incidence and severity. Addition of a cognitive measure did not have any appreciable effect on the prediction model. Further expanding the scope of the model can grant clinicians a tool to identify patients at risk for developing postoperative delirium.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis: Marion County suffers from stark racial disparities in infant mortality rate (IMR) with black babies experiencing an IMR of 11.6 and white babies 4.5, to culminate at a state average of 7.3. Since 2016, WeCare Indiana has worked to reduce the IMR in Central Indiana by connecting pregnant, post-partum, and childbearing age women with Community Health Workers (CHW) and community organizations that help with areas including but not limited to baby supplies, housing, and food insecurity. The goal of this research was to identify factors that promote changes in behaviors in WeCare clients as well as barriers to behavior modification in relation to the five pillars of the WeCare program: food insecurity, mental health, smoking, breastfeeding, and safe sleep.&#x0D; Experimental Design or Project Methods: Qualitative analysis of unstructured CHW follow-up notes from 2016 to 2018 of 1775 WeCare clients from mostly 13 highest risk zip codes for IM in Central Indiana was completed using keyword searches and clustering narrative entries into themes associated with the apriori areas of behavioral change.&#x0D; Results: Several key influencers of behavioral change were identified: (1) CHW dissemination of eligibility information about WIC, (2) CHW referral of clients to behavioral health resources, and (3) Pack n Play resources bundled with Safe Sleep class. Persistent barriers to positive behavioral change included: (1) lack of transportation to food resources, (2) unmanaged stress propagating substance use and smoking, (3) employment interfering with breastfeeding, and (4) lack of Safe Sleep education for all caretakers.&#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: Next steps include sharing qualitative findings with CHW to reinforce positive behavioral change as well as investigating solutions for the barriers that prevent change within the five pillars of WeCare Indiana. Data from this study will be used to help interpret the calculated behavioral change scores relative to baseline measures that were found from quantitative analysis.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for symptoms in cancer survivors. Identifying theory-based psychological processes underlying their effects on symptoms would inform research to enhance their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We conducted secondary analyses examining the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for cancer-related fatigue on mindfulness facets, self-compassion, and psychological inflexibility. We also examined whether changes in these processes were associated with the symptom outcomes of fatigue interference, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress.Thirty-five persistently fatigued cancer survivors (94% female, 77% breast cancer survivors) were randomized to either MBSR for cancer-related fatigue or a waitlist control (WC) condition. Self-report measures were administered at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. Then the WC group received MBSR and completed a post-intervention follow-up.Linear mixed modeling analyses of the first three time points showed steady increases over time for certain mindfulness facets (observing, acting with awareness, and nonjudging) and self-compassion in favor of the MBSR group. When analyzing pre- and post-intervention data across study conditions, none of the psychological processes predicted change in fatigue interference. However, increased nonjudging was associated with decreased sleep disturbance (β = -.39, p = .003), and increased acting with awareness was associated with decreased emotional distress (β = -.36, p = .003). Self-compassion did not predict change in symptom outcomes.Results point to specific psychological processes that may be targeted to maximize the efficacy of future MBSR interventions for cancer survivors.

AB  - This study aimed to use healthcare professionals' assessments to calculate expected risk of intravenous (IV) infusion harm for simulated high-risk medications that exceed soft limits and to investigate the impact of relevant risk factors. We designed 30 infusion scenarios for four high-risk medications, propofol, morphine, insulin, and heparin, infused in adult intensive care unit (AICU) and adult medical and surgical care unit (AMSU). A total of 20 pharmacists and 5 nurses provided their assessed expected risk of harm in each scenario. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance with least square mean, and post hoc test were conducted to test the effects of field limit type, soft (SoftMax), and hard maximum drug limit types (HardMax), and care area-medication combination on risk of harm. The results showed that overdosing scenarios with continuous and bolus dose limit types were assessed with significantly higher risks than those of bolus dose rate type. An overdose infusion in AICU over a large SoftMax was assessed to be of higher risk than over a small one, but not in AMSU. For overdose infusions with three levels of drug amount, greater drug amount in AICU and AMSU was assessed to have higher risk, except insignificant risk difference between the infusions with higher and moderate drug amount in AMSU. This study obtained expected risk for simulated high-risk IV infusions and found that different field limit and SoftMax types can affect expected risk based on healthcare professionals' perspectives. The findings will be regarded as benchmarks for validating risk quantification models in future research.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Brain tumors, including benign pituitary adenomas (PA), cause high levels of anxiety and distress. Patients with PA also report high unmet needs for information, a factor correlated with anxiety. Although many factors can contribute to anxiety, condition-specific education may alleviate anxiety for these patients. Aim: To explore the patients’ experience related to discovery of a pituitary adenoma and pilot a patient education intervention to address peri-diagnostic anxiety. Method: This mixed-methods pilot study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of an education intervention for adults diagnosed with PA (nonfunctioning PA or prolactinoma). At their first endocrine appointment, patients were given disease-specific information verbally, reinforced with printed material. Anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 and Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A)], patient satisfaction (Likert 1–5), patient knowledge of pituitary tumors [patient knowledge questionnaire (PKQ)] and need for information (Likert 1–5) was measured prior, immediately after, and 1 month following appointment. Patients participated in a semi-structured phone interview designed to explore patient diagnostic experiences pre-and post- intervention and to elicit patient evaluation of the intervention. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods. Results: Seventeen patients participated in the study; 15 of these completed the interview. Baseline need for information was high (4.6± 0.6). Anxiety level by VAS-A [median (IQR) was 50 (35–71) prior, 47 (21–68) immediately after and 1 month later 31 (14–44)] and GAD-7 [median value before 9 (4–13), immediately after 7 (3–13) and 1 month later 5 (3–8)] improved significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.01). PKQ was high at baseline (15 ± 0.4 /18) and increased (after 15.9 ± 0.4 and 1 month 15.8 ± 0.4, P=0.045). Patient satisfaction significantly improved (2.8 vs 4.6, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Analysis of the semi-structured interviews identified 3 main themes: (1) Communication, (2) Need for information; and (3) Impact of the diagnosis on patient experience. Patient experience in relation to each theme was reported negatively prior to the intervention and positively post-intervention. Conclusion: The diagnostic experience is challenging for patients with newly diagnosed PA and is associated with high levels of anxiety despite most patients being notified of the benign diagnosis. Although patients desire more information, patients scored highly on the baseline PKQ. The delivery of information had a significant positive impact on patient satisfaction and led to a reduction in anxiety. While these observations are not controlled, the themes identified have important clinical implications. They suggest that patient experience can be improved by a timely, streamlined diagnostic process with readily accessible information.

AB  - Abstract Context As many as one‐quarter of all residents in nursing facilities have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as a documented choice in the medical record, despite the likelihood of limited medical benefit in this setting. Objectives The aim of this study was to understand the perspectives of healthcare providers and nursing facility residents regarding CPR decisions. Methods We used qualitative interviews to examine the perspectives of residents with a documented decision for CPR in the medical record. We then compared residents’ views with those of healthcare providers who routinely conduct advance care planning (ACP) conversations in the nursing facility setting. Results Five themes emerged from the interviews: (a) Resident versus Provider Concerns, (b) Offering Information versus Avoidance, (c) Lack of Understanding of CPR, (d) Lack of Awareness, and (e) ‘Don't Keep Me on Machines'. Residents held misconceptions about CPR and/or exhibited an overall poor understanding of the relationship between their own health status and the likelihood of a successful CPR attempt. Although healthcare providers offer information and health education in an attempt to address knowledge gaps, these efforts are not always successful or even accepted by residents. Resident viewpoints and priorities differed from healthcare providers in ways that affected communication about CPR. Conclusions Unrecognised differences in perceptions between providers and residents affect key aspects of ACP communication that can impact CPR decision‐making. The concerns and priorities of institutionalized older adults may differ from those of healthcare providers, creating challenges for engaging some residents in ACP. Implications for Practice ACP communication models and training should be designed not only to explore nursing facility residents' goals, values, and preferences, but also to elicit any underlying differences in perceptions that may affect communication. Healthcare providers can identifying the primary concerns of residents and assist them with integrating or reframing these issues as a part of ACP discussions.

AB  - Mycobacterium mucogenicum is a rare non-tuberculous organism associated with catheter-related infections when pathogenic in humans. We present the first case of an external ventricular drain (EVD)-associated M. mucogenicum meningitis.A 55-year-old woman had EVD placement for obstructive hydrocephalus following traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained 5 days later for fever and neurological changes. M. mucogenicum was ultimately isolated from the CSF and the patient was placed on appropriate antibiotics. Her management included replacement of the EVD and a prolonged course of anti-mycobacterial antibiotics. CSF findings showed her response to therapy and neurological exam improved after 6 weeks.M. mucogenicum infections are very rare and existing reports indicate that it may be a device- or catheter-related pathogen. This microorganism has not been previously associated with an EVD. Ours may be the first documented report of EVD-related M. mucogenicum infection.

AB  - What does it take to successfully lead a Division of Geriatrics? Is it the same skill set today as it was two or three decades ago? Is it the same for each chief, given the wide spectrum of geriatrics programs across our nation? Early leaders in our field showcased and role‐modeled the career and job satisfaction that accompanies leadership of traditional geriatrics academic programs. This has been well articulated in past issues of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society in articles by Dr William Hazzard and Dr Greg Sachs. How can we develop the next generation of geriatrics program leaders and ensure their success? Developed as a conversation between three generations of geriatrics division chiefs, this reflective article offers a shared perspective on what is required for success in advancing as a leader in our field and wholeheartedly enjoying the best job in the world.

AB  - We thank Alexis Carter and colleagues for the opportunity to revisit this important topic. The use of diagnostic coding systems is a contentious area and represents a further reason why the WHO Essential Diagnostics List (EDL) team should engage the community of specialists in this field before publication of the next edition. In our original Comment,1McKnight J Wilson M Banning P et al.Effective coding is key to the development and use of the WHO Essential Diagnostics List.Lancet Digit Health. 2019; 1: e387-e388Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar we referenced Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) as a tool for assisting interoperability, for facilitating patient choice, allowing better national planning, and encouraging better clinical practice. We also mentioned other coding systems such as SNOMED CT and ICD-10 and remain largely impartial as to which systems are used. We did not offer a comparison of these systems, but we encourage the EDL team to review all available options. All coding systems have weaknesses and, importantly, so does the default non-coded system of using highly ambiguous and interchangeable names for tests. In response to Carter and colleagues, we must address several points. We agree that LOINC is complex because laboratory medicine is complex, and people without appropriate training should not be put in a position to choose the correct code. Including LOINC codes natively in the EDL would help avoid this issue. Although we acknowledge that the LOINC table is a flat structure, LOINC publishes a multiaxial hierarchy (MAH) based primarily on the component (analyte). This is not a strict ontology, but the MAH organises terms based on appropriate categories within a domain. LOINC is updated twice a year, as is SNOMED CT, and these updates are necessary to keep up with the pace of change in laboratory medicine. The survey cited by Carter and colleagues2Stram M Seheult J Sinard JH et al.A survey of LOINC code selection practices among participants of the College of American Pathologists Coagulation (CGL) and Cardiac Markers (CRT) proficiency testing programmes.Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2020; 144: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar that shows inaccurate assignment of codes had a 4·7% response rate (90 responses from 1916 laboratories), and although we agree that the findings suggest more investigation might be required, we question how representative this sample is given the strength of their conclusions. Although it is highly possible that the EDL will benefit high-income countries, it is in the health systems of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that it is expected to have the greatest effect, which is why the open, international, and community-driven approach of LOINC is uniquely suited to the EDL aims. Similarly, we decided to use LOINC in our project in Kenya that inspired our original piece1McKnight J Wilson M Banning P et al.Effective coding is key to the development and use of the WHO Essential Diagnostics List.Lancet Digit Health. 2019; 1: e387-e388Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar because it helped us resolve ambiguity in test names that were commonly mistaken by the many untrained staff and patients who used them. The codes helped with clarity and comparison, but they were not used in isolation and we do not advocate for this. Perhaps Carter and colleagues had higher-income settings in mind when they argued for interoperability based on reliance on manual mapping by those with expertise in laboratory medicine. Such individuals are rare indeed in health systems in LMICs. PB is a volunteer committee chair for the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes organisation. All other authors declare no competing interests. Effective coding is key to the development and use of the WHO Essential Diagnostics ListThe WHO new Essential Diagnostics List (EDL) aims to provide a structure for identifying, promoting, and increasing the supply and availability of the most effective and important in-vitro diagnostics (a full list of the included diagnostics is available in the appendix). The first edition of the EDL was published in November, 2018, but many revisions are expected given both its novelty and its importance in setting goals for health policy makers globally. It has no international antecedents, but the intention is to build on the success of WHO's well established Essential Medicines List. Full-Text PDF Open AccessUse of LOINC for interoperability between organisations poses a risk to safetyJacob McKnight and colleagues1 extol the positive impact of WHO's Essential Diagnostics List and assert that Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) will benefit its implementation.1 The absence of robust interoperability for laboratory test results is problematic, but flaws in LOINC render them unsafe for interoperability between organisations.

AB  - Hospitalists increasingly provide care for geriatric patients and little is known about the extent to which hospitalists adhere to evidence-based medication guidelines. This study aimed to characterize hospitalist adherence to BEERS guidelines for prescribing and monitoring benzodiazepines for older adults.We conducted a retrospective chart review of admitted patients aged 70-85 years who had been prescribed benzodiazepine. Charts from 351 patients were analyzed for documentation and decision rationale, which included 638 separate notes.Benzodiazepines were prescribed 28.2% of the time to address anxiety, which is inconsistent with the BEERS criteria; 39% had adequate data in the impression and plan section of the note to reflect why benzodiazepine was prescribed. Of note, the majority of notes had partial or missing data.Physicians tended to follow guidelines more than advance practice providers. Wide variation persists in prescribing practices and documentation related to benzodiazepines and both could potentially be addressed with further training.

AB  - Patient- and caregiver-reported 23-item SymTrak scales were validated for monitoring clinically actionable symptoms and impairments associated with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) in older adults. Items capture physical and emotional symptoms and impairments in physical and cognitive functioning. An abbreviated SymTrak is desirable when response burden is a concern.Develop and validate the 8-item SymTrak.Secondary analysis of SymTrak validation study; 600 participants (200 patient-caregiver dyads; 200 patients without an identified caregiver).Demographic questions, SymTrak, and Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3).SymTrak-8 demonstrated good fit to a one-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Concurrent criterion validity was supported by high standardized linear regression coefficients (STB) between baseline SymTrak-8 total score (independent variable) and baseline HUI3 preference-based overall HRQOL utility score (dependent variable; 0 = death, 1 = perfect health), after adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, and medications, with strength comparable to SymTrak-23 (STB = - 0.81 and - 0.84, respectively, for SymTrak-8 and SymTrak-23, when patient-reported; and - 0.60 and - 0.62, respectively, when caregiver-reported). Coefficient alpha (0.74; 0.76) and 24-h test-retest reliability (0.83; 0.87) were high for SymTrak-8 for patients and caregivers, respectively. The convergent correlation between brief and parent SymTrak scales was high (0.94). SymTrak-8 demonstrated approximate normality and a linear relationship with SymTrak-23 and HUI3. Importantly, a 3-month change in SymTrak-8 was sensitive to detecting the criterion (3-month reliable change categories; improved, stable, declined in HUI3 overall utility), with results comparable to SymTrak-23.SymTrak-8 total score demonstrates internal reliably, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and sensitivity to change that are comparable to SymTrak-23. Thus, patient- or caregiver-reported SymTrak-8 is a viable option for identifying and monitoring the aggregate effect of symptoms and functional impairments in patients with multimorbidity when response burden is a concern.

AB  - Persons with dementia (PWD) benefit from participating in meaningful activities. This study’s objective was to learn the characteristics of successful meaningful activities from community-based service providers who work with PWD. Six group interviews were performed with 15 unique professionals from an adult day service or community-based coordinated care program. These were supplemented by 100 hr of researcher immersion through weekly volunteering. Data were analyzed by a team, using qualitative content analysis. Participants reported successful activity content incorporated personalization; continuity and incremental challenges; and social engagement. Successful delivery of activities required managing necessary resources; involving informal (family/friend) caregivers; having a backup plan; monitoring time of day and energy levels; facilitating a domino effect; and ensuring safety. Outcomes of successful activities were experiencing fulfillment and purpose; overcoming challenges; and unexpected triggers. Research and practice recommendations include testing innovative, dynamic, and technology-enabled approaches to providing such activities.

AB  - Background/Objective: Older adults such as skilled nursing facility residents have increased risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 infection and comprise a large proportion of the COVID-19 pandemic’s deceased—the US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services report 232,831 cases and 38,518 resident deaths to date. Recent case reports reveal, as in other diseases, older adults may experience atypical symptomology, complicating identification of ill residents and efforts to slow transmission. While a few facility outbreaks have been characterized epidemiologically, little research exists regarding clinical timelines and trajectories which residents experience during COVID-19 illness. &#x0D; Methods: From May 9, 2020-June 1, 2020, daily notes on each COVID-19 positive resident’s status (n = 69) were taken by the medical director of a central Indiana nursing facility. Combined with a retrospective resident chart review of this same period, these notes were examined for COVID-19 infection symptoms and illness timelines to descriptively categorize a number of common illness trajectories and symptoms seen in residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection. &#x0D; Results: Residents fit four descriptive clinical timelines: concurrent symptom load with quick death (Avg 5.6 days) (n = 5), accumulating symptom load with gradual decline (Avg. 13.9 days) (n = 9), prolonged active symptom load with periods of stabilization and symptom reoccurrence (n = 42), and asymptomatic or atypical symptom load (n = 12). Most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. Of the 14 residents who died (20.3% of infected), 8 died in the facility and 6 died in the hospital. &#x0D; Conclusion and Implications: This retrospective case study adds to literature describing the presentation and symptomology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of skilled nursing facilities and aids efforts to evaluate resident presentation, prognosis, and disease course. Robust descriptions of expected clinical courses may support realistic expectations of disease progression for residents and their family members experiencing future outbreaks.

AB  - Background: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) takes an emotional toll on cancer survivors and significantly undermines quality of life following treatment. During a randomized controlled trial of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for post-treatment breast cancer survivors with clinically significant FCR, we conducted qualitative interviews to glean a deeper understanding of the impact of ACT on survivors’ coping with FCR. &#x0D; Methods: Breast cancer survivors (stage I-III) who had completed a 6-week ACT intervention were invited to share their experiences in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using a deductive approach. Participants received a $25 gift card for their time. Participants (n=16) were primarily White (81.3%) and college educated (68.8%), with a mean age of 57.3 (SD=11.1) and 75% had an income over $50,000. &#x0D; Results: Prior to the study, survivors generally coped with FCR by denying their FCR or by attempting to control their fears through faith, lifestyle management, avoidance, and positivity. Survivors uniformly noted the sense of community they felt in their ACT group when listening to other survivors describe their own struggle with FCR. This common bond created a foundation that allowed survivors to embrace the ACT intervention and develop adaptive coping skills related to acceptance, present-moment awareness, and living consistently with one’s values. Survivors noted that these skills reduced the negative impact of FCR and other life challenges and improved quality of life compared to pre-study coping techniques. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: By building trust with other cancer survivors, participants were able to shift from attempts to ‘control’ FCR to a more ‘accepting’ approach to manage FCR and other life stressors. While research with a larger group of participants is needed, initial findings indicate that ACT may be a promising addition to care for cancer survivors.

AB  - Background: Delirium is a common post-operative complication for patients who undergo esophagectomy. The pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood, limiting therapeutic options. To advance our pathophysiologic understanding, we conducted this study to evaluate the association of protein expression with postoperative delirium. &#x0D; Methods: A case-control study was performed using blood samples from the PEPOD randomized clinical control trial (NCT02213900). 52 patients (26 cases with delirium, 26 control) who were &gt;18 years old, spoke English, and underwent esophagectomy were included, while those with schizophrenia, Parkinson’s, alcohol abuse, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, haloperidol allergy, and severe dementia were excluded. Samples were from pre-op and post-op day 1. Delirium was assessed for using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, while the severity was assessed using DRS-R-68. Proteomic analysis was performed using TMT 10ples isobaric labels. Proteome Discoverer and STRING web-based tools were used for bioinformatic analyses, and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Odds (WMWodds) test was used to report between-group differences in protein abundance ratios. &#x0D; Results: 52 samples (26 cases, 26 controls) were analyzed for this study. Elevated protein abundance ratios of Coagulation factor IX (Median (IQR): 1.18 (1.08-1.28) p=0.047) and Mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase (Median (IQR): 1.50 (1.35-1.60) p=0.049) were noted in patients that developed delirium. Elevated protein abundance ratios of angiotensinogen (Median (IQR): 1.19 (1.14-1.23) p=0.038), ceruloplasmin (Median (IQR): 1.02 (0.98-1.08) p=0.038), and Complement C2 (Median (IQR): 1.01 (0.96-1.08) p=0.016) were noted in control patients. Protein abundance ratios for Complement C2 (Spearman rs=0.31, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.02]) and Mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase (rs=0.61, 95%CI [0.29, 0.81]) were associated with the severity of delirium in case patients. &#x0D; Conclusions: Changes in proteins associated with coagulation, inflammation, and protein handling were identified. These could be evaluated in future studies to develop tools for predicting onset and severity of post-operative delirium.

AB  - Background/Objective: &#x0D; Since January 2020, there have been over 3 million individuals infected with the coronavirus in the United States, quickly spreading across at least 171 countries. The severity and morbidity of patients with COVID-19 are significantly increased when comorbidities, such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), are present. Because the main target of SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, patients with CKD may be a more vulnerable population. The goal of this study was to determine if COVID-19 positive patients with CKD had increased mortality, inpatient admission, and ED visitation rates compared to those without CKD. &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods: &#x0D; This retrospective chart review includes patients from over 100 separate healthcare entities who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and July 13, 2020 and are over the age of 18. The subjects were first separated into those diagnosed with CKD and those without, basic descriptive calculations were computed, and a Chi Square test was used to analyze outcomes. &#x0D; &#x0D; Results: &#x0D; The CKD COVID-19 positive population was compromised of 47.5% men and 52.5% women while the non-CKD control group was made up of 45.4 % men, 54.1% women, and 0.5% other. The median Charlson index for the CKD and non-CKD population was 4 and 1, respectively. The interest and control groups were further divided into subpopulations by age and race and analyzed accordingly. Chi square tests demonstrated that there is a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in all clinical outcomes tested of CKD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-CKD patients. The CKD population had increased mortality, inpatient admission, and ED visitation rates when compared. &#x0D; &#x0D; Discussion: &#x0D; This study demonstrates that comorbidities, more specifically CKD, may be associated with a higher severity of COVID-19 than those without. Future studies are needed to explore the relationship more extensively, analyze other outcomes, and manage confounding variables.

AB  - Background: Although colonoscopy (CY) may be considered the best screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC), annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which quantifies fecal hemoglobin is a viable alternative. Countries and healthcare systems using FIT-based screening may need to prioritize which FIT positive persons requires CY sooner (e.g. within the same fiscal year). We conducted a systematic review of published literature to understand how the yield/positive predictive value (PPV) of FIT could be improved. &#x0D; Study Design: We performed a search of electronic databases for articles published between 2015 and June 2020. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently screened. Included studies fulfilled predetermined criteria and had descriptive and quantitative data extracted. We identified studies comparing the yield of FIT for advanced colorectal neoplasia ([AN], CRC plus advanced adenomas) among FIT positive persons to the yield of AN when FIT is combined with risk factors (age, sex, BMI, etc.). Data were extracted to find yield and efficiency of FIT alone vs FIT plus risk factors among FIT positive persons. &#x0D; Results: From 623 titles reviewed, 4 studies met inclusion criteria. The objective of the studies was to increase the yield of AN or CRC in FIT positive patients. The number needed to scope (NNS) among FIT positives to detect AN significantly decreased for each study when looking at high risk groups as yield/PPV increased. The yield with FIT alone ranged from 24% to 46% and the NNS from 2.2 to 4.1. With risk factors, yield and NNS among those at high risk were 33.2 % to 75.6% and from 1.3 to 3.0, respectively. &#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: This systematic review quantifies how risk factors improve the yield for AN in FIT positive persons, which is information required for countries and health care settings with limited resources that need to direct CY resources to FIT positive patients at high risk for AN.

AB  - Background/Objective: &#x0D; High mortality rates among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients have raised concerns regarding use of mechanical ventilation in management of patients with COVID-19. Additional data is needed in this discussion to better understand treatment strategies for this vulnerable population. We conducted a study to examine length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, and risk factors for death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods: &#x0D; Observational study in patients admitted to Eskenazi Health and Indiana University Health Methodist ICUs. Participants were 18 years and older patients admitted to the ICU from March 1 2020 to April 27, 2020 who tested positive for COVID-19. Primary outcomes for this study were in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the ICU. &#x0D; &#x0D; Results: &#x0D; The study cohort was made up of 242 patients. The mortality rate was 19.8% (48/242) for the overall cohort and 20.5% (38/185) for mechanically ventilated patients. Age was a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality [increased hazard in in-hospital mortality: age 65-74 years (HR: 3.1, 95%Cl=1.2-7.9, p=0.021), age 75+ (HR: 4.1, 95%CI=1.6-10.5, p=0.003) compared to those younger than 65]. In our Cox’s proportional hazard model, ESRD (HR:5.9, 95%CI=1.3-26.9, p=0.021) along with age were the only risk factors with statistical significance. The median duration of mechanical ventilation in the overall cohort was 9.3 days (IQR=-5.7-13.7). In patients that died, median ICU length of stay was 8.7 days (IQR=4.0-14.9), compared to 9.2 days (IQR=4.0-14.0) in those discharged alive. &#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion/Clinical Impact: &#x0D; We found lower mortality rates and longer length of stays in our cohort than in previous studies. While more data is needed, this study supports continued use of mechanical ventilation ARDS recommendations for treating patients with ARDS from COVID-19. Further, this data potentially shows a benefit to not having a strained healthcare system.

AB  - In the US alone, the chronic pain condition of fibromyalgia affects approximately 10 million people. Current treatment protocols focus heavily on pharmacological interventions; however, such treatments are unfavorable due to debilitating side effects and a lack of effectiveness in 2/3 of patients. Two non-pharmacological interventions which have been shown to produce meaningful pain relief are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Aerobic Exercise. However, the combinatorial effects of these treatments have never been fully explored and it is unknown if these treatments interact in an additive manner or if the benefits of one negate the benefits of the other. In this work we conducted a literature review using the databases of Pubmed, OVID MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and Embase from 1995 to May 2020 to determine if the combinatorial effects of these two treatments on pain relief and pain interference are significantly greater than that of aerobic exercise alone. We reviewed over 200 potential articles for relevance. Seven papers were found to directly address our target question, two from the US and five from Europe with sample sizes ranging from 34 to 442. One paper showed improvement in pain intensity and two papers showed improvement in pain interference due to combinatorial treatment over aerobic exercise alone. When evaluating our results, we weighted these papers based on sample size, length of treatment and observation, method of CBT administration, and surveys chosen for data collection. We were unable to definitively show that CBT in combination with aerobic exercise is more effective than aerobic exercise alone at decreasing pain intensity and/or interference in patients with fibromyalgia. However, most of these papers identified several psychological and design based confounding factors that could influence their results. We recommend that more research be conducted in this area to further ascertain the effectiveness of this specific combinatorial treatment for fibromyalgia.

AB  - "Implementation" of new initiatives in healthcare settings typically encompasses two distinct components: a "clinical intervention" plus accompanying "implementation strategies" that support putting the clinical intervention into day-to-day practice. A novel clinical intervention, for example, might consist of a new medication, a new protocol, a new device, or a new program. As clinical interventions are not self-implementing, however, they nearly always require effective implementation strategies in order to succeed. Implementation strategies set out to engage healthcare providers, staff and patients in ways that increase the likelihood of the new initiative being successfully adopted, a process that often involves behavior change and new ways of thinking by participants. One of the challenges in studying implementation is that it can be difficult to collect data about the status and progress of implementation, including participants' own perspectives and experiences concerning implementation to date. This protocol describes a novel method for collecting and analyzing data related to ongoing implementation called the Participant-Reported Implementation Update and Score, or PRIUS. The PRIUS method allows for the efficient and systematic capture of qualitative and quantitative data that can provide a detailed and nuanced account of implementation over time and from multiple viewpoints. This longitudinal method can enable researchers, as well as implementation leaders and organizational stakeholders, to monitor implementation progress more closely, conduct formative evaluation, identify improvement opportunities, and gauge the effect of any implementation changes on a rolling basis.

AB  - Abstract Objective We aimed to examine 1) the relationship between multifocal pain and clinical characteristics, including demographics, pain outcomes, somatic symptoms, health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety, and 2) whether multifocal pain was independently associated with treatment response. Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis on veterans with chronic pain enrolled in the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial with complete data at 9 months (n = 222). We examined baseline relationships and used multivariable linear regression to examine whether multifocal pain was independently associated with outcomes that included Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Interference scale and Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) scores between baseline and 9 months. Results The sample had a mean BPI Interference score of 5.3 ± 2.2 and a mean GCPS score of 65.6 ± 13.7, 55% had significant depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale [PHQ-9] score of ≥10), and 42% had significant anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7] score of ≥10). Veterans reporting three or more pain sites (the “more diffuse pain” group) had significantly less improvement on GCPS (b = 4.6, standard error [SE] = 2.3, P = 0.045), BPI Interference (b = 1.0, SE = 0.2, P = 0.0011), and health-related quality of life (Short-Form 36-item scale, Physical Component Summary) (b = 4.1, SE = 1.0, P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than did veterans reporting fewer than three pain sites (the “less diffuse pain” group). More diffuse pain was not associated with changes in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores. Conclusions Multifocal pain predicted worse pain outcomes between baseline and 9 months in veterans enrolled in a trial for treating chronic musculoskeletal pain.

AB  - ABSTRACT IMPACT: I hope that our work will improve surveillance endoscopy experiences, by engaging both patients and providers. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: A large proportion of colonoscopies are performed for post-polypectomy surveillance. Data show that there is overuse of surveillance for low-risk adenomas (LRAs), which can be attributed to patient and provider factors. The objective is to understand patient and provider perspectives for decision-making for LRA surveillance colonoscopy. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Semi-structured, one-on-one virtual interviews of patients and providers are currently being conducted at Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center and Eskenazi Health. Using a criterion sampling approach, we identified patients 50-75 years of age who had a screening colonoscopy with finding of LRAs, and providers in primary care and gastroenterology, at each site. We plan to recruit at least 8 patients and 8 providers from each site until thematic saturation. Domains that will be covered include: perceived involvement with surveillance decision-making; experiences with, and preferences for, communication about test results; and barriers and facilitators to undergoing colonoscopy. A 3-phase approach, comprising immersion, reduction, and interpretation, is being used to collect and analyze data. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: This study is currently in the recruitment phase and results will be forthcoming. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Understanding decision-making for LRA surveillance colonoscopy will inform future interventions to improve endoscopic resource use and efficiency while improving patient and provider experiences with endoscopic care coordination.

AB  - ABSTRACT IMPACT: Indiana CTSI Team Science to maximize rapid collection, analyses and dissemination of biosamples collected from patients with Covid-19 to provide preliminary data for grant applications on the pathogenesis and outcomes of patients with Covid-19. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: When Covid-19 hit Indiana in April, there was an immediate need to respond rapidly to coordinate research across our healthcare systems. The CTSI became a point of contact for coordinating research endeavors including activation of clinical trials and use of precious samples from patients with Covid-19 to maximize preliminary data for grants. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The Indiana CTSI coordinated collection of biospecimens at multiple hospitals using in person and remote consenting via telephone or on a smartphone utilizing a QR code. We also retrieved existing samples from the Indiana Biobank previously collected for future research and from subject positive for Covid-19 by search of the linked electronic health record (EHR). A total of 224 subject samples (7 children, 36 previously collected, and 6 with both acute and recovered specimens) were obtained over a four month period. Our CTSI cores ran varied analyses collated to a single database, linked to the EMR for use as preliminary data for grant applications to avoid redundancy of measures on limited samples. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The 224 subject samples were used for whole exome DNA sequencing, RNA seq, analyses of 48 plasma cytokine/chemokines by multiplex analyses, and PBMC isolated for culture and assessment of secreted cytokines. The clinical data were linked and included demographics, hospitalization length of stay and need for mechanical ventilation, max and min oxygen levels, liver function tests, IL-6, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and ferritin, need for dialysis, and echocardiography. Additional clinical data were available upon request. A survey was sent to our CTSI email to query for potential interest in the data with 87 inquiries, and to date 46 investigators have requested data and/or additional samples. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: During the first surge of Covid-19, the CTSI coordinated analyses for the dissemination of results for use by CTSI investigators to minimize duplication of assays and increase availability. The collaboration of research coordinators, biobank, research cores, and informatics demonstrates the power and agility of team science in the Indiana CTSI.

AB  - The inability to prescribe blood transfusions is a potential barrier to timely hospice enrollment for patients with blood cancers. The benefits and harms of transfusions near the end of life (EOL), however, are poorly characterized and patients' preferences are unknown. We sought to characterize the recollections of bereaved caregivers about the relationships between transfusions and hospice enrollment decisions.We recruited 18 bereaved caregivers of 15 decedents who died within 6-18 months of the interview. Interviews focused on caregivers' recollections of transfusion and hospice enrollment decisions. Transcripts were analyzed for themes.We identified 2 themes. First, caregivers described that transfusions were necessary and the decisions to receive transfusions or not were deferred to the clinicians. Second, only 1 caregiver recalled transfusions as relevant to hospice decisions. In that instance there was a delay. Caregivers identified difficulties recognizing death was imminent, hope for miracles, and the necessity of accepting life was ending as more relevant barriers.The results indicate clinicians' beliefs in transfusion at EOL may be a more relevant barrier to hospice enrollment than patients' preferences. Strategies to evaluate accurately and discuss the actual benefits and harms of transfusions at the EOL are necessary to advise patients and integrate their preferences into decisions.

AB  - Abstract Background Comorbidities influence the outcomes of injured patients, yet a lack of consensus exists regarding how to quantify that association. This study details the development and internal validation of a trauma comorbidity index (TCI) designed for use with trauma registry data and compares its performance to other existing measures to estimate the association between comorbidities and mortality. Methods Indiana state trauma registry data (2013–2015) were used to compare the TCI with the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices, a count of comorbidities, and comorbidities as separate variables. The TCI approach utilized a randomly selected training cohort and was internally validated in a distinct testing cohort. The C‐statistic of the adjusted models was tested using each comorbidity measure in the testing cohort to assess model discrimination. C‐statistics were compared using a Wald test, and stratified analyses were performed based on predicted risk of mortality. Multiple imputation was used to address missing data. Results The study included 84,903 patients (50% each in training and testing cohorts). The Indiana TCI model demonstrated no significant difference between testing and training cohorts (p = 0.33). It produced a C‐statistic of 0.924 in the testing cohort, which was significantly greater than that of models using the other indices (p &lt; 0.05). The C‐statistics of models using the Indiana TCI and the inclusion of comorbidities as separate variables—the method used by the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program—were comparable (p = 0.11) but use of the TCI approach reduced the number of comorbidity‐related variables in the mortality model from 19 to one. Conclusions When examining trauma mortality, the TCI approach using Indiana state trauma registry data demonstrated superior model discrimination and/or parsimony compared to other measures of comorbidities.

AB  - Nursing home (NH) patients are extensive users of emergency department (ED) services. Problematically, poor information sharing and incomplete access to information complicates the delivery of care in EDs for NH patients. Paper-based transfer forms can support information sharing, but have significant limitations. Standards-based automated transfer-forms that leverage health information exchange data may address the limitations of paper-based forms and better support care delivery. This study developed a prototype SMART on FHIR automated transfer form for NH patients using priority data elements identified through individual interviews, a review of existing transfer forms, a targeted survey of end users, and a design workshop. Analyses were grounded in the 5 Rights of clinical decision support framework. The most valuable data elements included: emergency contact/healthcare proxy, current medication list, reason for transfer to the ED, baseline neurological state, and relevant diagnoses / medical history. The working prototype was successfully deployed within an Amazon Web Service environment.

AB  - While the utility of computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) for multiple select clinical domains has been clearly demonstrated, much less is known about the full breadth of domains to which CCDS approaches could be productively applied. To explore the applicability of CCDS to general medical knowledge, we sampled a total of 500 primary research articles from 4 high-impact medical journals. Employing rule-based templates, we created high-level CCDS rules for 72% (361/500) of primary medical research articles. We subsequently identified data sources needed to implement those rules. Ourfindings suggest that CCDS approaches, perhaps in the form of non-interruptive infobuttons, could be much more broadly applied. In addition, our analytic methods appear to provide a means of prioritizing and quantitating the relative utility of available data sources for purposes of CCDS.

AB  - When public health laws are passed that affect clinical practice within hospitals, it is important to educate physicians about best practices in implementing these laws into routine patient care in hospitals. An educational video was developed to inform physicians about a new state public health care law. This study sought to determine whether an educational video about a new state public health care law improves physicians' knowledge of the law and how to implement the law during clinical practice. A total of n=33 internal medicine physicians participated in this study. This study found that an educational video was successful in increasing physician knowledge about a new public health care law that affects clinical practice. The utilization of validated educational videos may provide a useful resource when attempting to provide education about new public health laws that effect the provision of medical care.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to provide empirical guidance by comparing the performance of six different area-level SDoH measurement approaches in predicting patient referral to a social worker and hospital admission after a primary care visit.We compared the performance of six area-level SDoH measurement approaches in predicting patient referral to a social worker and hospital admission after a primary care visit using random forest classification algorithm. Data came from 209,605 patient encounters at a federally qualified health center. Models with each area-based measurement approach were compared against the patient-level data only model using area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.Addition of area-level features to patient-level data improved the overall performance of models predicting need for a social worker referral. Entering area-level measures as individual features resulted in highest model performance.Researchers seeking to include area-level SDoH measures in risk prediction may be able to forego more complex measurement approaches.

AB  - ObjectivesPotentially avoidable hospitalizations are harmful to nursing home residents. Despite extensive care transitions research, no studies have described transfers originating outside the nursing home (eg, visiting family members or at a dialysis center). This article describes 82 out-of-facility (community) transfers and compares them to transfers originating within the nursing home (direct transfers).DesignSecondary data analysis with multivariable model for community transfer risk factors.Setting and ParticipantsEighty-two community transfers and 1362 transfers originating in the nursing home, involving 870 residents enrolled in the OPTIMISTIC demonstration project between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016.MethodsTransfers were compared using data from the Minimum Data Set and root cause analyses performed at time of transfer. Multivariable associations were assessed at the transfer level to define risk factors for community transfers. Project nurses collected data on community transfers to inform a root cause analysis.ResultsResidents with community transfers were younger (74.4 years vs 78.2 years), with lower prevalence of cognitive impairment (44.8% vs 70.3%) and higher rates of heart failure (38.7% vs 23.3%) than residents with direct transfers. Community transfers were more likely due to cardiovascular illness (31.2% vs 8.7%), whereas less likely to be for cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric concerns (11.7% vs 22.7%). Nearly half (46%) of community transfers originated at dialysis centers. Residents transferred outside the nursing home were less likely to have documented limitations to care such as a do not resuscitate code status. Communication during community transfers was identified on root cause analyses as a potential area for improvement.Conclusions and ImplicationsCommunity transfers were more likely to occur in younger residents with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and lower rates of cognitive impairment. Improved communication between nursing home staff and outside providers as well as more extensive advance care planning for residents with cardiovascular disease may reduce community transfers.

AB  - When caring for healthcare patients, professional chaplains may find an increasing proportion of individuals in the U.S. who do not identify as religious and who may benefit from creative approaches to discussing their spiritual and existential concerns. One approach to engaging patients is using a “third voice,” as shared in a personal narrative in which a chaplain uses landscape photographs to engage a patient for discussion of spiritual and existential concerns. The content of the conversation may inform decisions about treatment, quality of life, and person-centered care.

AB  - Abstract Objective Our objectives were to: 1) assess the relationship between self-reported opioid use and baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and pain outcomes; and 2) examine whether baseline opioid use moderated the intervention effect on outcomes at 9 months. Design We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial, which found stepped-care to be effective for chronic pain in military veterans. Setting A post-deployment clinic and five general medicine clinics at a Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Subjects In total 241 veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain; 220 with complete data at 9 months. Methods Examination of baseline relationships and multivariable linear regression to examine baseline opioid use as a moderator of pain-related outcomes including Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Interference scale, and Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) at 9 months. Results Veterans reporting baseline opioid use (n = 80) had significantly worse RMDQ (16.0 ± 4.9 vs. 13.4 ± 4.2, P &amp;lt; .0001), GCPS (68.7 ± 12.0 vs. 65.0 ± 14.4, P = .049), BPI Interference (6.2 ± 2.2 vs. 5.0 ± 2.1, P &amp;lt; .0001), and depression (PHQ-9 12.5 ± 6.2 vs. 10.6 ± 5.7, P = .016) compared to veterans not reporting baseline opioid use. Using multivariable modeling we found that baseline opioid use moderated the intervention effect on pain-related disability (RMDQ) at 9 months (interaction Beta = −3.88, P = .0064) but not pain intensity or interference. Conclusions In a stepped-care trial for pain, patients reporting baseline opioid use had greater improvement in pain disability at 9 months compared to patients not reporting opioid use.

AB  - One path to improving weight management may be to lessen the self-control burden of physical activity and healthier food choices. Opportunities to lessen the self-control burden might be uncovered by assessing the spatiotemporal experiences of individuals in daily context. This report aims to describe the time, place, and social context of eating and drinking and 6-month weight change among 209 midlife women (n = 113 African-American) with obesity receiving safety-net primary care.Participants completed baseline and 6-month weight measures, observations and interviews regarding obesogenic cues in the home environment, and up to 12 ecological momentary assessments (EMA) per day for 30 days inquiring about location, social context, and eating and drinking.Home was the most common location (62%) at times of EMA notifications. Participants reported "yes" to eating or drinking at the time of nearly one in three (31.1% ± 13.2%) EMA notifications. Regarding social situations, being alone was significantly associated with less frequent eating and drinking (OR = 0.75) unless at work in which case being alone was significantly associated with a greater frequency of eating or drinking (OR = 1.43). At work, eating was most common late at night, whereas at home eating was most frequent in the afternoon and evening hours. However, eating and drinking frequency was not associated with 6-month weight change.Home and work locations, time of day, and whether alone may be important dimensions to consider in the pursuit of more effective weight loss interventions. Opportunities to personalize weight management interventions, whether digital or human, and lessen in-the-moment self-control burden might lie in identifying times and locations most associated with caloric consumption.Clinical trial registration: NCT03083964 in clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is widely used for colorectal cancer screening, its only indication. Its effect on clinical decision-making beyond screening is unknown. We studied the use of FIT in emergency and inpatient settings and its impact on patient care.Using electronic medical records, we reviewed all non-ambulatory FITs performed from November 2017 to October 2019 at a tertiary care community hospital. We collected data on demographics, indications, gastroenterology consultations, and endoscopic procedures. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the effect of FIT on gastroenterology consultation and endoscopy.We identified 550 patients with at least 1 FIT test. Only 3 FITs (0.5%) were performed for colorectal cancer screening. FITs were primarily ordered from the emergency department (45.3%) or inpatient hospital floor (42.2%). Anemia (44.0%), followed by gastrointestinal bleeding (40.9%), were the most common indications. FIT was positive in 253 patients (46.0%), and gastroenterology consultation was obtained for 47.4% (n = 120), compared with 14.5% (n = 43) of the 297 FIT-negative patients (odds ratio 3.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.23-4.82, P < .0001). A potential bleeding source was identified in 80% of patients with reported or witnessed overt gastrointestinal bleeding, a similar proportion (80.7%; P = .92) to patients who were FIT positive with overt gastrointestinal bleeding. Multivariate analysis showed that melena, hematemesis, and a positive FIT were associated with gastroenterology consultation (all P < .05), while only melena (odds ratio 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-7.54) was associated with endoscopy.Nearly all emergency department and inpatient FIT use was inappropriate. FIT resulted in more gastroenterology consultation but was not independently associated with inpatient endoscopy.

AB  - We describe a clinical trial which is seeking to determine the effectiveness and understand implementation outcomes for tele-collaborative specialty care for Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI).This study will be a hybrid type 1 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial comparing tele-collaborative specialty care to electronic consultation for Gulf War Veterans with GWI (N = 220). In tele-collaborative specialty care, the specialty provider team will deliver health coaching and problem-solving treatment to Veterans and recommend a plan for analgesic optimization. In electronic consultation, the specialty provider team will make a one-time recommendation to the primary care team for locally delivered health coaching, problem-solving treatment and analgesic optimization. The primary aim will be to determine the effectiveness of tele-collaborative specialty care as compared to electronic consultation to reduce disability related to GWI. Our secondary aim will be to understand implementation outcomes.There is a need to improve care for Veterans with GWI. A potentially useful model to improve care is tele-collaborative specialty care, where the specialists work with the primary care provider to synergistically treat the patients.This is the first clinical trial to prospectively compare different models of care for Veterans with GWI. This responds to multiple calls for research to improve treatment for Veterans with GWI, including from the National Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Emerging concerns following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic are the long-term effects of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. Dysgeusia in COVID-19 is supported by the abundant expression of the entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), in the oral mucosa. The invading virus perturbs the commensal biofilm and regulates the host responses that permit or suppress viral infection. We correlated the microbial recognition receptors and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) with the SARS-CoV2 measures in the saliva of COVID-19 patients. Data indicate that the toll-like receptor-4, peptidoglycan recognition protein, and sACE2 are elevated in COVID-19 saliva and correlate moderately with the viral load.

AB  - Restrictions in sharing Patient Health Identifiers (PHI) limit cross-organizational re-use of free-text medical data. We leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce synthetic unstructured free-text medical data with low re-identification risk, and assess the suitability of these datasets to replicate machine learning models. We trained GAN models using unstructured free-text laboratory messages pertaining to salmonella, and identified the most accurate models for creating synthetic datasets that reflect the informational characteristics of the original dataset. Natural Language Generation metrics comparing the real and synthetic datasets demonstrated high similarity. Decision models generated using these datasets reported high performance metrics. There was no statistically significant difference in performance measures reported by models trained using real and synthetic datasets. Our results inform the use of GAN models to generate synthetic unstructured free-text data with limited re-identification risk, and use of this data to enable collaborative research and re-use of machine learning models.

AB  - Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) represent a significant source of health care spending in the United States. Existing literature is largely descriptive and there is limited information about how an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization for ACSCs is related to prior ambulatory care visits. A retrospective, observational study was conducted using health records from a large midwestern health system during a 20-month period between 2012 and 2014. Our primary variables were (1) type of care setting (i.e., ED visit or hospitalization) and (2) whether the patient received ambulatory care services in the 14, 30, and 60 days before the ED visit or hospital admission. Of patients seen in the ED for ACSCs, 11.9%, 16.3%, and 21.67% were seen in ambulatory care in the 14, 30, and 60 days prior, respectively. Of those hospitalized for ACSCs, 29.1%, 39.9%, and 53% were seen in ambulatory care in the 14, 30, and 60 days prior, respectively. These results highlight a potential lost opportunity to address ACSCs in the ambulatory care setting. Such knowledge can inform interventions to reduce avoidable ACSC-related acute care use and health care costs, and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: Low education significantly elevates dementia risk but it is not clear whether this is through chronic systemic inflammation, early-onset dementia pathology, or other factors. This project compares biomarkers of inflammation and dementia pathology in a young-old and older cohort. Due to significantly lower education in the young-old cohort, we hypothesized evidence of similar or higher biomarker levels in the young-old cohort compared to the older cohort. &#x0D; Methods: Blood samples were used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1RA), and the brain biomarkers phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL). Inflammatory markers were measured at the Considine Lab at the Indiana University School of Medicine using ELISA assays while p-tau and NfL were measured with Simoa assays at the Quanterix lab in Massachusetts. We used the natural logarithm of all biomarker variables to address skewed data. Linear regression was used to investigate race- and gender-adjusted differences in the biomarkers. &#x0D; Results: The young-old cohort (N=42) has a mean age of 62.4, 69.1% are female, and 78.6% are non-Hispanic black (NHB), while the older cohort (N=60) has a mean age of 80.3, 60% are female, and 20% are NHB. Median education in the young-old cohort is 12 vs 16 in the older cohort. Adjusted models showed higher mean CRP (p=0.004) and lower mean IL-10 (p&lt;0.001) in the young-old cohort. TNF- (p &lt;0.001), IL-6 (p=0.021), and IL-1(p=0.017), P-tau (p=0.003), and NfL (p&lt;0.001) were all higher in the older cohort. &#x0D; Conclusion: We found partial support of our hypothesis in that the younger, low education cohort had higher mean CRP and lower mean IL-10 (anti-inflammatory). However, brain biomarkers were higher in the older cohort. More research will be needed to determine if and how low education elevates ADRD risk through systemic inflammation. &#x0D;

The CDC's recommendation was associated with a decrease of 12.3 percentage points in correct mask-wearing (95% CI, -23.47 to -1.05; P = .032).Behavior encouraged by local mask requirements appeared to be resilient to changes in state policy. CDC recommendations appeared influential.

AB  - Background: &#x0D; Cancer heterogeneity can impact diagnosis and therapeutics. This has been studied at the cellular level using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) but not spatially. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has recently enabled measuring transcriptomes at hundreds of locations in a tissue, revolutionizing our understanding of tumor heterogeneity. Low RNA quantities in scRNA-seq and ST introduce missed reads and noise. Multiple methods have been developed to impute and smooth scRNA-seq data including MAGIC and SAVER. To date, only our newly developed spatial and pattern combined smoothing (SPCS) method has been developed specifically for ST. We compared the biological interpretability of these smoothing methods to determine which method best informs tumor heterogeneity.&#x0D; Methods: &#x0D; Ten ST slides from six patients with PDAC were computationally smoothed using SAVER, MAGIC, and SPCS. ST spots from unsmoothed and smoothed slide were split into TM4SF1 high or low expression groups and differentially expressed genes (DEG) found. Significant up- and down-regulated DEGs were used for functional enrichment analysis (EA) to compare the biological insights each method provides.&#x0D; Results:&#x0D; DEGs were found in eight samples, with SPCS finding the most DEGs in six of the eight samples. The number of EA terms generally correlated with the numbers DEGs. SPCS had the most up-regulated enriched terms for every ST slide. Top ten up- and down-regulated EA terms were presented from one ST slide to demonstrate that SPCS gives more biologically interpretable results. Lastly, we present SPCS terms previously been reported in PDAC or involved in the TM4SF1 cancer pathway.&#x0D; Conclusion: &#x0D; Smoothing ST data using SPCS provided more DEGs and more useful EA terms. The EA terms found using SPCS are more consistent with our current understanding of PDAC. Not smoothing, MAGIC, and SAVER missed many important terms which SPCS found. Compared to other methods, SPCS smoothed data is more interpretable.

AB  - Aspects of religiosity and spirituality (R/S) are associated with alleviating stress and influencing the treatment decision-making process in surrogates of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the population, but no significance has been established with spiritual well-being. This study hypothesized that the pandemic negatively affected surrogate spiritual well-being in a relationship mediated by a surrogate’s intrinsic religiosity, religious coping, and non-organizational religiosity. It was also hypothesized that surrogates would desire less aggressive treatments and have lower goals of patient function due to the pandemic. Baseline surrogate survey data using the FACIT-sp, Brief RCOPE and Durel scales, as well as answers to questions regarding treatment preferences and goal of patient function from the Chaplain Family Project were used in this study along with the pandemic status of the surrogate at the time of interview. There were 100 surrogates interviewed prior to the pandemic and 82 interviewed during the pandemic with a mean age of 54.5 and 53.8 years, respectively, who were mostly white (82.0% and 75.6%, respectively), female (72.0% and 72.0%, respectively), and on average had obtained at least an associate degree. There was a significantly greater preference for aggressive, life-sustaining interventions (LSIs) over relief of pain (26.1% pre-pandemic to 40.9% during pandemic, p=0.0494) and a significantly fewer proportion of patient-surrogate advance conversations (66.7% to 51.9%, p=0.0435) in the during pandemic group. There was no statistical difference found in spiritual well-being, intrinsic religiosity, religious coping, non-organizational religiosity (NOR), treatment preferences, nor patient function goals between the pandemic status groups, when controlling for surrogate demographics and previous patient advance care planning. A longitudinal study should further investigate the possible effect of the pandemic upon surrogate spiritual well-being and ICU decisions and experiences for greater clarity.

AB  - Abstract The impact of COVID-19 on dementia caregivers is gaining new interest. It is unknown how the pandemic has impacted caregivers’ burden and existential suffering. Analyses were performed on data for dementia caregivers (n=89) enrolled in the Indiana University Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Caregivers (TACTICs) pilot trials. Individuals were primary caregivers of a family member with dementia and had clinically significant anxiety measured by a GAD-7 score &amp;gt;10 or between 5-9 with reported interference in life. COVID-19 anxiety was measured using the NIH CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) questions. Caregivers were on average 55.2 years of age with 56.2% being child or child-in-law, 71.9% were white and 24.7% were Black. Mean burden scores, measured by the Zarit Burden Index, were higher (44.29) compared to means reported across the literature (26.7) indicating the sample experienced higher than normal levels of burden. Mean existential suffering scores measured by the subscale of Experience of Suffering Scale were lower (9.37) compared to means across the literature (11.5) indicating that overall participants experienced lower levels of existential suffering compared to those in previous studies. A significant relationship was found between COVID-19 anxiety and burden levels (x2= 9.07, p&amp;lt;0.05), with higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety associated with greater burden. A non-significant relationship was found between COVID-19 anxiety and existential suffering (x2=5.99, p=0.11). Results highlight the impact of COVID-19 anxiety as an external stressor on dementia caregiving. and the importance of considering context of external stressors when implementing intervention protocols for caregivers of individuals with dementia.

AB  - Background &amp; Hypothesis: Treatment decisions for medical management, endovascular therapy, open surgery, and hybrid approaches for peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely driven by imaging. While catheter-directed angiography remains the gold-standard for endoluminal vessel analysis, currently, there is not widespread clinical use of machine learning to provide automated segmentation. This project aims to develop an active learning pipeline to automate the labeling of vascular structures in angiographic images. &#x0D; Methods: We queried the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) database for Indiana University Health and Eskenazi Health to identify studies with catheter-directed angiograms of the extremities. From this dataset we randomly selected an initial convenience sample of 50 angiograms to manually label using the 3D Slicer software. We compared three workflow approaches for labeling this training data - (1) human-only single-pass labelling whereby one person labels each image; (2) human-only multi-pass labelling whereby three humans label a vessel with increasing precision; (3) “human-in-the-middle” approach using NVIDIA’s AI-Assisted Annotation client whereby the image is auto-segmented and then manually checked for accuracy. &#x0D; Results: We are currently evaluating speed and accuracy for each of these approaches. However, our preliminary data suggests that human-only multi-pass labeling is most efficientappreac We will be validating the following three-step process. First, thresholding tool was used to leverage differences in contrast gradations to approximate the location of vascular structure. Second, the eraser tool was utilized to refine the vessel boundaries. Finally, major blood vessels contributing to axial flow to the foot were manually labeled. These labeled angiograms will be used to develop an active learning algorithm to automate future labeling of the remaining dataset. &#x0D; Conclusion: A machine learning approach to interpreting lower extremity images can dramatically improve the efficiency of triaging patients with PAD. Further work is underway to develop and implement this program clinically.

AB  - Background: Asthma is the most common chronic illness among the pediatric patient population. While several studies have investigated the biological and environmental factors associated with asthma exacerbations, research on the relationship between asthma and social determinants of health is limited. This scoping review addresses this gap in knowledge by exploring social factors that are associated with the risk of asthma exacerbations among pediatric patients and mapping identified variables onto the SAVI database.&#x0D; Methods: The OVID Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were systematically searched for studies published as of July 2, 2021. No restrictions on study design or publication type were made but search was limited to English manuscripts. Resulting studies were screened based on phased eligibility criteria on Covidence. In Phase 1, duplicates were removed. In Phase 2, studies unrelated to asthma and those with participants outside of 2-18 years of age were excluded based on title and abstract screening. In Phase 3, studies that investigated asthma exacerbations as well as its association with social factors were retained while studies solely looking at non-social factors or abstract-only studies were excluded based on the full text screening. In Phase 4, data on frequency of both inpatient and outpatient physician visits for asthma were extracted along with information on study characteristics and social factors.&#x0D; Results: Following the initial database search, 3312 studies were retrieved for the scoping review. 772 duplicates were removed during Phase 1. 1628 studies were excluded during the abstract and title screening in Phase 2. Upon resolving 384 conflicts, the remaining 912 studies proceeded to full text screening in Phase 3.&#x0D; Conclusion: The initial literature screening suggests an association between social risk factors and pediatric asthma exacerbations. Incorporating large scale change of these social factors with individual pharmacological treatment could help improve pediatric asthma outcomes.

AB  - Background/Objective: The WeCare program aims to reduce infant mortality through the community health worker model by assisting high risk women of child-bearing age. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional challenges for women already at high risk factor for infant mortality (IM). The aim of this survey study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this population.&#x0D; Methods: Enrolled WeCare participants were given an optional COVID-19 phone survey (modified from the IeDEA survey*) between August 2020 and May 2021 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their daily lives, income, food security, and mental health. Trained research assistants and community health workers administered surveys. Verbal consent was obtained over the phone. Data was entered into REDCap. From REDCap, data was exported to SAS version 9.4 to calculate descriptive statistics and chi square tests.&#x0D; Results: Fifty-six primarily women of color (68%) completed the survey. Sixty-two percent of women lived in high-risk zip codes for infant mortality in Central Indiana. Fifty-seven percent of women worked prior to the outbreak. Forty-eight percent of the working women lost income, and seventy percent of women worked jobs requiring interaction with the public. These women experienced greater food insecurity (38%), depression (24%), and anxiety (31%) compared to before the pandemic (p&lt;0.001).&#x0D; Conclusion/Discussion: The demographics and residence of those interviewed were representative of the WeCare cohort (NS differences in race/ethnicity/age). In comparing the prevalence of food insecurity, depression and anxiety between the survey sampled during covid and prior to covid, all factors were significantly increased. These vulnerable women (many pregnant or postpartum), often major breadwinners in their household, held jobs putting them at high risk for covid infections, and lost these high-risk jobs at an alarming rate. These data confirm the detrimental impact of COVID-19, especially on a population already at high risk for IM. &#x0D; Acknowledgement of original authors of the *IeDEA survey: Suzanne Goodrich, Michael Scanlon, Leslie Enane, Kara Wools-Kaloustian

AB  - Background/Objective: Mammography is one of the most effective ways to diagnose breast cancer early; however, its perceived benefits are complicated by terminal conditions such as dementia. By undergoing mammography, women with dementia risk treatment complications and false-positive results, which can exacerbate psychological distress. The lack of a standard of care confounds the individual roles of the patient, family caregiver, and physician in the decision-making process. This study evaluates the relationship between dementia severity and family caregiver preferences for shared decision making.&#x0D; Methods: Data were gathered from the Decisions about Cancer screening in Alzheimer’s Disease trial, which uses the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS) and a revised version of the Control Preferences Scale (CPS) to assess family caregiver preferences for decision-making as a dyad (patient and caregiver) and triad (patient, caregiver, and physician). Two multinomial logistic regression models assessed the relationship between DSRS and CPS categories (active, passive, and collaborative), while controlling for the caregivers’ age, gender, education, relationship to patient, self-perceived income, and race. Both models used the “active” group as the baseline; however, Model 1 examined preferences as a dyad and Model 2 as a triad.&#x0D; Results: Model 1 found a statistically significant association between dementia severity and a collaborative approach (p&lt;0.001), and between dementia severity and a passive approach (p=0.014). For every one-unit increase in DSRS score, the odds of being in the collaborative group decreased by 0.083 and the odds of being in the passive group decreased by 0.085. There was no statistically significant association between dementia severity and decision-making preferences in Model 2.&#x0D; Clinical Significance: The association between dementia severity and family caregiver decision-making preferences supports the need for a standard of care regarding breast cancer screening in women with dementia.

AB  - Background/Objective: Real-world data, including electronic health records (EHRs), has shown tremendous utility in research relating to opioid use disorder (OUD). Traditional analysis of EHR data relies on explicit diagnostic codes and results in incomplete capture of cases and therefore underrepresentation of OUD rates. Machine learning can rectify this by surveying free clinical notes in addition to structured codes. This study aimed to address disparities between true OUD rates and cases identified using traditional ICD codes by developing a natural language processing (NLP) machine for identifying affected patients from EHRs.&#x0D; Methods: Patients (≥12 years old) who had received an opioid prescription from IU Health or Eskenazi Health between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2015 were identified by the Regenstrief Institute. Exclusion criteria included any cancer, sickle cell anemia, or palliative care diagnoses. Cases of OUD were identified through ICD codes and NLP. The NLP machine was developed using a dictionary of key OUD terms and a training corpus of 300 patient notes. A testing corpus of 148 patient notes was constructed and validated by manual review. The NLP machine and ICD 9/10 codes were independently tested against this corpus.&#x0D; Results: Although ICD codes identified OUD cases with high specificity (98.08%), this method demonstrated moderate sensitivity (53.13%), accuracy (68.92%), and F1 score (68.92%). Testing using the NLP method demonstrated increased sensitivity (93.75%), increased accuracy (89.19%), and increased F1 score (91.84%); specificity mildly decreased (80.77%).&#x0D; Conclusion: Our revised NLP machine was more effective at capturing OUD cases in EHRs than traditional identification using ICD codes. This illustrates NLP’s enhanced capability of identifying OUD cases compared to structured data.&#x0D; Potential Impacts: These findings establish a role for NLP in OUD research involving large datasets. Ultimately, this is intended to improve identification of risk factors for OUD, which is of significant clinical importance during a public health crisis.

AB  - Background: Large automated electronic medical record (EMR) databases, together with natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, have the potential to be valuable tools in studying the patterns and effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, the current study sought to develop novel tools to identify bladder cancer cases, their clinical stage, and the chemotherapy they receive in electronic medical records.&#x0D; Methods: EMR data were obtained from Indiana University Health hospitals from 2008 to 2015. We developed 2 novel algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) on unstructured data to identify (a) bladder cancer cases and clinical stage, and (b) chemotherapy names and line of chemotherapy. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the clinical staging and treatment algorithm were calculated against the gold standard of manual chart review&#x0D; Results: A total of 2,559 unique bladder cancer patients were identified and stratified using the clinical staging algorithm, defined as metastatic, muscle invasive, or non-muscle invasive. We identified 657 metastatic cases, 567 muscle invasive cases, and 604 non-muscle invasive cases. Further, we calculated the PPV for metastatic cases as 69.9%, muscle invasive as 80.4%, and non-muscle invasive as 79.1%. Next, the treatment algorithm was applied to metastatic patients to identify the type of chemotherapy received and 1st or 2nd line of therapy. The PPV for identifying the 1st and 2nd lines were 70.5% and 55.6%, respectively. The PPV for gemcitabine/carboplatin or cisplatin was 57.5%, but for methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, was 37.5%.&#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: The performance of the algorithm demonstrates the potential for NLP to identify cancer cases, stage, and presence of treatment. While providing meaningful information, the accuracy of the approach suggests that a hybrid method using both NLP algorithms and manual chart review remains the most robust approach. The low performance of the algorithm to identify line of therapy further highlights the need for further NLP development in this area and emphasizes the ongoing need for either human entry or review of structured data.

AB  - Background/Objective: Anticipatory grief is the process of experiencing normal bereavement before the physical death of a significant person. To date, anticipatory grief has been related to higher levels of caregiver depression, anxiety, subjective burden, and poorer problem solving. Additionally, higher levels anticipatory grief are observed in caregivers of those with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) compared to caregivers of other conditions. The primary objective of this analysis is to determine the relationship between caregiver anticipatory grief and dementia severity, as measured by the Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS) and Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), respectively.&#x0D; Methods: Multiple regression analyses were performed on data for ADRD caregivers (n=56) enrolled in the IU Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Caregivers (TACTICs) trial; an RCT testing an ACT intervention for ADRD caregiver anxiety. Inclusion criteria included identifying as the primary caregiver of an ADRD patient and clinically significant anxiety (GAD7 score &gt;10).&#x0D; Results: The average age of caregivers was 61.9 years, 41.1% were spouses, 83.9% were white and 14.3% were black. Mean anticipatory grief scores were notably higher (84.6) compared to the previously reported means across the literature. Multiple regression models showed a caregivers’ anticipatory grief is not significantly associated with the patients’ dementia severity as measured by the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (t=0.87). Results also revealed that higher levels of caregiver burden, as measured by the Zarit Burden Index, are significantly associated with more anticipatory grief (t=&lt; 0.1).&#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: Understanding these relationships contributes to better understanding ADRD caregivers, identifying “high-risk” caregivers, and informing future interventions and care.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis&#x0D; Bacterial vaginosis, which is the imbalance of normal vaginal microbiota, contributes to preterm delivery, vaginitis, and decreased drug efficacy. Despite metronidazole efficacy in reducing BV contributing organisms, BV continues to recur in 50% of patients. Previous studies showing imidazole propionate’s role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes suggest that similar metabolite-regulated pathways in vaginal microbiomes may be the key in pathogenesis of uterine diseases such as BV. Thus, the purpose of this study was to observe the relationship between vaginal metabolites, host or microbiome-derived, and transcriptomic responses in vaginal epithelial tissues stratified by vaginal microbiome composition (“microbiome group”). The hypothesis was that differences in vaginal microbiome composition result in differential regulation of metabolite-host pathway functional relationships.&#x0D; Project Methods&#x0D; Transcript levels and metabolite concentrations precollected from 23 East African women were processed and analyzed via R. Transcriptomic data were converted into KEGG pathway enrichment scores via ssGSEA2.0, a package within R. Enrichment scores were correlated (Spearman) with metabolite levels by microbiome group and lactobacillus dominant phenotypes, and relationships were visualized via Heatmap3 and Cytoscape.&#x0D; Results: &#x0D; The results showed varying strengths in correlation among metabolites and KEGG pathway enrichment scores after filtering for strong correlations (R &gt; |0.5|) and significance (p&lt; 0.05). Nonlactobacillus dominant microbiomes showed fewer strongly associated metabolite-KEGG pathway relationships compared to the lactobacillus dominant microbiome group, specifically the imidazole-related networks.&#x0D; Conclusion: &#x0D; In this study, variations in significant correlations among metabolites and KEGG pathways suggests that microbiome diversity may contribute to how metabolites regulate host pathways in vaginal epithelial cells. The reduced pathway interactions observed in imidazole compounds suggests that dysregulation may contribute to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. This method of modelling could be used to characterize the regulation of critical pathways associated with the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.

The authors provide clear rationale regarding the use of music to stimulate movement, increase exercise tolerance, and to distract participants from the perception of dyspnea. Through this report, we offer further insights specifically focused on the RAS process, including vital considerations when implementing a music-based intervention in clinical practice settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate, revise, and extend the Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) for expressing clinical permissions, including reuse of residual clinical biospecimens and health data. This study followed a formative evaluation design and used a bottom-up modeling approach. Data were collected from the literature on US federal regulations and a study of clinical consent forms. Eleven federal regulations and fifteen permission-sentences from clinical consent forms were iteratively modeled to identify entities and their relationships, followed by community reflection and negotiation based on a series of predetermined evaluation questions. ICO included fifty-two classes and twelve object properties necessary when modeling, demonstrating appropriateness of extending ICO for the clinical domain. Twenty-six additional classes were imported into ICO from other ontologies, and twelve new classes were recommended for development. This work addresses a critical gap in formally representing permissions clinical permissions, including reuse of residual clinical biospecimens and health data. It makes missing content available to the OBO Foundry, enabling use alongside other widely-adopted biomedical ontologies. ICO serves as a machine-interpretable and interoperable tool for responsible reuse of residual clinical biospecimens and health data at scale.

No nurse practitioners submitted ADR incidents. We generated a descriptive model of an ADR decision-making process and analysed emerging themes, categorised into four stages: detection of potential ADR, investigation of the problem's cause, risk/benefit consideration, and plan, action and follow-up. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) relied on several confirmatory or disconfirmatory cues to detect and investigate potential ADRs. Evaluating risks and benefits of related medications played an essential role in HCPs' pursuits of solutions CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an illustrative model of how HCPs detect problems and make decisions regarding ADRs. The design of supporting technology for potential ADR problems should align with HCPs' real-world cognitive strategies, to assist fully in detecting and preventing ADRs for patients.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about how individuals with chronic pain use tailored internet-based interventions. This study is the first to compare self-reported skill module use to observed module access and to examine each of these in relationship to tailored recommendations to access specific content. Participants (N = 58) enrolled in a 10-week trial of the Pain EASE program, a tailored internet-based intervention that includes 10 pain self-management skill modules. Participants completed a “Self-Assessment,” which was used to provide a “Personalized Plan” that encouraged accessing specific modules. Participants self-reported module use during weekly data collection telephone calls. Program log data were extracted to capture “observed” module use during the trial period. Findings indicated significantly greater self-reported use of the Pain EASE modules compared to observed access with log data. Further, log data revealed that participants accessed less than half of the modules recommended to them via tailoring.

AB  - Abstract As a method of research, pragmatic trials are recommended so as to generate results that are applicable to real‐world care. This intent is especially important for the millions of older adults who receive long‐term care in thousands of nursing homes and assisted living communities across the country—and many millions more around the globe. This article presents key points raised by experts participating in a conference funded by the National Institute of Aging held at the 2021 conference of the Society for Post‐Acute and Long‐term Care Medicine. The purpose of the conference was to convene leading clinicians, researchers, and industry partners to address special considerations of pragmatic trials in long‐term care. Cross‐cutting and unique challenges and solutions to conducting pragmatic trials were discussed focusing on 3 areas of clinical relevance to long‐term care: (1) functional care and outcomes, (2) psychosocial care and quality of life, and (3) medical care and outcomes, with a special focus on persons with dementia. Challenges and innovative solutions were organized across the 9 domains of the revised Pragmatic‐Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) Tool, and future research recommendations for pragmatic trials in long‐term care were identified.

AB  - We appreciate the discussion about our article, “Reducing Prescribing Errors through Creatinine Clearance Alert Redesign.”1Melton B.L. Zillich A.J.

We agree with Gaffo's et al's comments indicating that dosing allopurinol requires numerous considerations, and that medical evidence and consideration of patient-specific factors are paramount for medical decisions. The alerts in our study1Melton B.L. Zillich A.J.

Our study team defined correct and incorrect actions for allopurinol by incorporating information available from Micromedex,2Micromedex 2.0. Drug monographs. Available at: http://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/librarian/. Accessed January 15, 2016.Google Scholar whose information about renal dosing is confirmed by a May 2015 package insert for allopurinol as provided by Accord Healthcare (Durham, NC).3Accord Healthcare Allopurinol [package insert]. Accord Healthcare, Durham, NC2015Google Scholar We fully acknowledge that clinical guidelines, latest medical evidence, and standards of practice sometimes conflict, and that the definition of an error might thus change according to which guideline or standard is chosen. We acknowledge that any implementation of alerts in real clinical practice–just as with all clinical decision support–would require deliberation and periodic updates, to ensure appropriateness and consistency with the most current guidelines, evidence, and standards of practice. Our study does not assert any specific clinical guideline as much as it tests the effect of an innovative alert display. Our redesigned display provided easier access to laboratory results1Melton B.L. Zillich A.J.

Although providers can review and monitor uric acid levels and hepatic function, in our simulation, no provider reviewed these laboratory tests prior to acting on the alert information. Regardless of how the reader currently defines erroneous prescribing of allopurinol, our study demonstrated that a redesigned alert display leads to a significant change in practice. With our patient scenario, this change was consistent with evidence and information that would be readily available to a primary care provider. The capabilities of our design can be used to improve prescribing and safety. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our study further. This discussion underscores the importance of interdisciplinary input about alert systems and illustrates the challenges associated with developing effective clinical decision support. Allopurinol Dose Reductions Based on Creatinine Alert Redesign SystemThe American Journal of MedicineVol. 129Issue 7PreviewMelton et al1 describe a creatinine alert redesign system built within the Veterans Affairs electronic medical record. Highlighted in the paper is the fictional case of an 89-year-old veteran with a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL requesting a refill on allopurinol. The study intervention labels as a “correct” action a dose reduction in allopurinol below 200 mg/day and as “incorrect” the renewal or increase in the medication dose. This recommendation is based on Micromedex drug monographs. Full-Text PDF

AB  - As a method of research, pragmatic trials are recommended so as to generate results that are applicable to real-world care. This intent is especially important for the millions of older adults who receive long-term care in thousands of nursing homes and assisted living communities across the country-and many millions more around the globe. This article presents key points raised by experts participating in a conference funded by the National Institute of Aging held at the 2021 conference of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-term Care Medicine. The purpose of the conference was to convene leading clinicians, researchers, and industry partners to address special considerations of pragmatic trials in long-term care. Cross-cutting and unique challenges and solutions to conducting pragmatic trials were discussed focusing on 3 areas of clinical relevance to long-term care: (1) functional care and outcomes, (2) psychosocial care and quality of life, and (3) medical care and outcomes, with a special focus on persons with dementia. Challenges and innovative solutions were organized across the 9 domains of the revised Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) Tool, and future research recommendations for pragmatic trials in long-term care were identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Provide recruitment support via a coordinated application of strategic operations, participant engagement practices, and informatic capabilities best practices. Improve study success through the discovery of optimal recruitment practices, development of needed services, leverage of existing resources, infrastructure and guidance. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The optimization effort utilized a variety of methods for engaging participants and obtaining information related to the recruitment needs of study teams. Information was collected from an advisory board and through surveys of a diverse group of investigators and research coordinators examining recruitment barriers as well as current and possible future recruitment services. A workflow of the investigative teams recruitment experience was created to identify strengths, gaps and areas for improvement. This information was used to develop a set of recommendations for the Indiana CTSI leadership. Three pillars were tasked with tackling specific areas through an integrative and collaborative approach: (1) study planning and operations, (2) informatics, and (3) participant engagement and health literacy. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Key resulting recommendations included: creating a recruitment navigator to direct clients to the most appropriate service(s), adding a community engaged staff member and a digital public engagement specialist to the recruitment services team, redesigning the website navigations, creating participant payment guidelines, creating participant engagement principles guidelines, improving informatics support, and continual evaluation of best practices and innovations in recruitment support. An intake and follow-up survey were created for clients to assess services offered, those used, and ultimately the success of those services in improving recruitment measures. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The optimization efforts have shown a positive response from study teams demonstrated by an uptick of support requests. By taking an intensive strategic planning approach to streamlining recruitment services, the Indiana CTSI has leveraged existing resources to better serve clients in need of critical recruitment assistance.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic cough affects approximately 10% of adults. The lack of ICD codes for chronic cough makes it challenging to apply supervised learning methods to predict the characteristics of chronic cough patients, thereby requiring the identification of chronic cough patients by other mechanisms. We developed a deep clustering algorithm with auto-encoder embedding (DCAE) to identify clusters of chronic cough patients based on data from a large cohort of 264,146 patients from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. We constructed features using the diagnosis within the EMR, then built a clustering-oriented loss function directly on embedded features of the deep autoencoder to jointly perform feature refinement and cluster assignment. Lastly, we performed statistical analysis on the identified clusters to characterize the chronic cough patients compared to the non-chronic cough patients. Results The experimental results show that the DCAE model generated three chronic cough clusters and one non-chronic cough patient cluster. We found various diagnoses, medications, and lab tests highly associated with chronic cough patients by comparing the chronic cough cluster with the non-chronic cough cluster. Comparison of chronic cough clusters demonstrated that certain combinations of medications and diagnoses characterize some chronic cough clusters. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to test the potential of unsupervised deep learning methods for chronic cough investigation, which also shows a great advantage over existing algorithms for patient data clustering.

AB  - Given that participants' experiences in clinical trials include a variety of communication touchpoints with clinical trial staff, these communications should be designed in a way that enhances the participant experience by paying attention to the self-determination theoretical concepts of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. In this feature, we argue that clinical trial teams need to consider the importance of how they design their written participant communication materials, and we explain in detail the process our multidisciplinary team took to design written materials for the patient and family caregiver participants in our Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening trial. This article concludes with suggested guidance and steps for other clinical trial teams.

AB  - National and international guidelines recommend the use of 1 dose of intravesical chemotherapy immediately following surgery for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, which is performed infrequently on a population level. We sought to understand the importance of potential environmental and clinical dimensions involved in the decision to offer this therapy.Urologists from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) rated 8 distinct clinical vignettes involving patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. A ratings-based conjoint analysis method was used to evaluate the clinical vignette responses. Each vignette included 4 clinical dimensions and 2 environmental dimensions, with each dimension consisting of 2 possible attributes. The relative importance of each attribute was derived from the regression model and ranked in order.A total of 58 urologists answered the clinical vignettes which represents >75% of MUSIC sites. The median age of urologists was 53, most were male, and median years in practice was 20 years post residency. An environmental attribute, having a recovery room protocol for instilling and disposing of the chemotherapy, ranked as the most influential attribute for giving postoperative chemotherapy (utility=8.6). The clinical attribute yielding the strongest preference for giving chemotherapy was tumor grade (utility=4.9). These preferences varied by different subgroups of urologists, particularly regarding the type of practice a urologist was in.This study demonstrates that urologists have clear preferences for when they offer postoperative immediate chemotherapy. Factors beyond just clinical variables play a role in this decision making process such as the structure of the recovery room.

AB  - Abstract Background This update describes changes to the Brief Educational Tool to Enhance Recovery (BETTER) trial in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods/design The original protocol was published in Trials . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BETTER trial converted to remote recruitment in April 2020. All recruitment, consent, enrollment, and randomization now occur by phone within 24 h of the acute care visit. Other changes to the original protocol include an expansion of inclusion criteria and addition of new recruitment sites. To increase recruitment numbers, eligibility criteria were expanded to include individuals with chronic pain, non-daily opioid use within 2 weeks of enrollment, presenting musculoskeletal pain (MSP) symptoms for more than 1 week, hospitalization in past 30 days, and not the first time seeking medical treatment for presenting MSP pain. In addition, recruitment sites were expanded to other emergency departments and an orthopedic urgent care clinic. Conclusions Recruiting from an orthopedic urgent care clinic and transitioning to remote operations not only allowed for continued participant enrollment during the pandemic but also resulted in some favorable outcomes, including operational efficiencies, increased enrollment, and broader generalizability. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04118595 . Registered on October 8, 2019.

AB  - To improve cancer care in Indiana, a telementoring program using the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model was introduced in September 2019 to promote best-practice cancer prevention, screening, and survivorship care by primary care providers (PCPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the program's educational outcomes in its pilot year, using Moore's Evaluation Framework for Continuing Medical Education and focusing on the program's impact on participants' knowledge, confidence, and professional practice. We collected data in 22 semi-structured interviews (13 PCPs and 9 non-PCPs) and 30 anonymous one-time surveys (14 PCPs and 16 non-PCPs) from the program participants (hub and spoke site members), as well as from members of the target audience who did not participate. In the first year, average attendance at each session was 2.5 PCPs and 12 non-PCP professionals. In spite of a relatively low PCP participation, the program received very positive satisfaction scores, and participants reported improvements in knowledge, confidence, and practice. Both program participants and target audience respondents particularly valued three features of the program: its conversational format, the real-life experiences gained, and the support received from a professional interdisciplinary community. PCPs reported preferring case discussions over didactics. Our results suggest that the Cancer ECHO program has benefits over other PCP-targetted cancer control interventions and could be an effective educational means of improving cancer control capacity among PCPs and others. Further study is warranted to explain the discrepancies among study participants' perceptions of the program's strengths and the relatively low PCP participation before undertaking a full-scale effectiveness study.

AB  - Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO©) was developed to democratize knowledge among health professionals in underserved communities. Evidence supporting the use of this model for cancer control is limited. Using surveys adapted from Moore's evaluation framework, we evaluated the training outcomes of an ECHO program on cancer prevention and survivorship care. The study provides preliminary evidence that the ECHO model is a feasible way to build cancer control capacity among the healthcare workforce.

AB  - Configurational methods are increasingly being used in health services research.To use configurational analysis and logistic regression within a single data set to compare results from the two methods.Secondary analysis of an observational cohort; a split-sample design involved randomly dividing patients into training and validation samples.Patients who had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) in US Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals.The patient outcome was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or recurrent ischaemic stroke within 1 year post-TIA. The quality-of-care outcome was the without-fail rate (proportion of patients who received all processes for which they were eligible, among seven processes).For the recurrent stroke or death outcome, configurational analysis yielded a three-pathway model identifying a set of (validation sample) patients where the prevalence was 15.0% (83/552), substantially higher than the overall sample prevalence of 11.0% (relative difference, 36%). The configurational model had a sensitivity (coverage) of 84.7% and specificity of 40.6%. The logistic regression model identified six factors associated with the combined endpoint (c-statistic, 0.632; sensitivity, 63.3%; specificity, 63.1%). None of these factors were elements of the configurational model. For the quality outcome, configurational analysis yielded a single-pathway model identifying a set of (validation sample) patients where the without-fail rate was 64.3% (231/359), nearly twice the overall sample prevalence (33.7%). The configurational model had a sensitivity (coverage) of 77.3% and specificity of 78.2%. The logistic regression model identified seven factors associated with the without-fail rate (c-statistic, 0.822; sensitivity, 80.3%; specificity, 84.2%). Two of these factors were also identified in the configurational analysis.Configurational analysis and logistic regression represent different methods that can enhance our understanding of a data set when paired together. Configurational models optimise sensitivity with relatively few conditions. Logistic regression models discriminate cases from controls and provided inferential relationships between outcomes and independent variables.

AB  - The Chronic Pain Treatment Tracker (Tx Tracker) is a prototype decision support tool to aid primary care clinicians when caring for patients with chronic noncancer pain. This study evaluated clinicians' perceived utility of Tx Tracker in meeting information needs and identifying treatment options, and preferences for visual design.We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with primary care clinicians from four health systems in Indiana. The interviews were conducted in two waves, with prototype and interview guide revisions after the first six interviews. The interviews included exploration of Tx Tracker using a think-aloud approach and a clinical scenario. Clinicians were presented with a patient scenario and asked to use Tx Tracker to make a treatment recommendation. Last, participants answered several evaluation questions. Detailed field notes were collected, coded, and thematically analyzed by four analysts.We identified several themes: the need for clinicians to be presented with a comprehensive patient history, the usefulness of Tx Tracker in patient discussions about treatment planning, potential usefulness of Tx Tracker for patients with high uncertainty or risk, potential usefulness of Tx Tracker in aggregating scattered information, variability in expectations about workflows, skepticism about underlying electronic health record data quality, interest in using Tx Tracker to annotate or update information, interest in using Tx Tracker to translate information to clinical action, desire for interface with visual cues for risks, warnings, or treatment options, and desire for interactive functionality.Tools like Tx Tracker, by aggregating key information about past, current, and potential future treatments, may help clinicians collaborate with their patients in choosing the best pain treatments. Still, the use and usefulness of Tx Tracker likely relies on continued improvement of its functionality, accurate and complete underlying data, and tailored integration with varying workflows, care team roles, and user preferences.

AB  - Topic modeling is an active research area with several unanswered questions. The focus of recent research in this area is on the use of a vector embedding representation of the input text with both generative and evolutionary topic modeling techniques. Unfortunately, it is hard to compare different techniques when the underlying data and preprocessing steps that were used to develop the models are not available. This paper presents two secondary datasets that can help address this gap. These datasets are derived from two primary datasets. The first consists of 8145 posts from the r/Cancer health forum and the second consists of 18,294 messages submitted to 20 different news groups. The same preprocessing procedure is applied to both datasets by removing punctuation, stop words and high frequency words. Each dataset is then clustered using three different topic modeling techniques: pPSO, ETM and NVDM and three topic numbers: 10, 20, 30. In addition, for pPSO two text embeddings representation are considered: sBERT and Skipgram. The secondary datasets were originally developed in support of a comparative analysis of the aforementioned topic modeling techniques in a study titled "Comparing PSO-based Clustering over Contextual Vector Embeddings to Modern Topic Modeling" submitted to the Journal of Information Processing and Management. The present paper provides a detailed description of the two secondary datasets including the unique identifier that can be used to retrieve the original documents, the pre-processing scripts, the topic keywords generated by the three topic modeling techniques with varying topic numbers and embedding representations. As such, the datasets allow direct comparison with other topic modeling techniques. To further facilitate this process, the algorithm underlying the evolutionary topic modeling technique, pPSO, proposed by the authors is also provided.

AB  - Risk-stratification tools that have been developed to identify transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients at risk of recurrent vascular events typically include factors which are not readily available in electronic health record systems. Our objective was to evaluate two TIA risk stratification approaches using electronic health record data.Patients with TIA who were cared for in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals (October 2015-September 2018) were included. The six outcomes were mortality, recurrent ischemic stroke, and the combined endpoint of stroke or death at 90-days and 1-year post-index TIA event. The cohort was split into development and validation samples. We examined the risk stratification of two scores constructed using electronic health record data. The Clinical Assessment Needs (CAN) score is a validated measure of risk of hospitalization or death. The PREVENT score was developed specifically for TIA risk stratification.A total of N = 5250 TIA patients were included in the derivation sample and N = 4248 in the validation sample. The PREVENT score had higher c-statistics than the CAN score across all outcomes in both samples. Within the validation sample the c-statistics for the PREVENT score were: 0.847 for 90-day mortality, 0.814 for 1-year mortality, 0.665 for 90-day stroke, and 0.653 for 1-year stroke, 0.699 for 90-day stroke or death, and 0.744 for 1-year stroke or death. The PREVENT score classified patients into categories with extreme nadir and zenith outcome rates. The observed 1-year mortality rate among validation patients was 7.1%; the PREVENT score lowest decile of patients had 0% mortality and the highest decile group had 30.4% mortality.The PREVENT score had strong c-statistics for the mortality outcomes and classified patients into distinct risk categories. Learning healthcare systems could implement TIA risk stratification tools within electronic health records to support ongoing quality improvement.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02769338 .

AB  - The Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) measures individuals' unique perceptions of their illness. While psychometric properties of the IPQ-R have been demonstrated in many disease populations, its content validity has not been extensively studied in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unique features of CKD (e.g., few symptoms in early stages) may impact the measurement of illness perceptions. The purpose of this study was to explore the IPQ-R content validity in a sample of CKD patients.Thirty-one participants completed the IPQ-R and were interviewed regarding their subscale scores (timeline, consequences, personal control, treatment control, coherence, cyclical, and emotions). Participants' agreement with their scores was tallied and assessed qualitatively for themes related to the content validity of the measure.Individual participant agreement with their subscale scores averaged 79% (range: 29-100%). Subscale agreement varied: timeline (100%), consequences, coherence, and emotion (83% each), cyclical (75%), personal control (65%), and treatment control (64%). A qualitative exploration of disagreement responses revealed concerns with the relevance and comprehensibility of personal control and treatment control.Some IPQ-R subscales may pose content validity concerns in the non-dialysis CKD population. Item modification for comprehensibility (personal control) and relevance (treatment control) should be considered. Future studies should explore the impact of a patient's symptom experience on IPQ-R validity, especially in populations like CKD with a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients.

If uptake in 45–49 year olds is brisk, how can (and will) colonoscopy capacity increase? From a quality perspective, what effect will 45–49 year olds have on adenoma detection rates (ADR), the most evidence-based measure of colonoscopy quality?10Corley D.A. Jensen C.D.

Prevalence of any adenoma, advanced adenoma, any sessile serrated lesion, advanced sessile serrated lesion, adenomas per colonoscopy, and lesions per colonoscopy were analyzed according to first screening or rescreening, with patients divided into 5-year age groups from <45 years to ≥85 years. Both overall and age group–specific prevalence rates were calculated and compared between Periods I and II. Patients 45–49 years old were compared specifically with initial screening of 50–54 year olds and with rescreening of 50–75 year olds, the aim of this latter comparison to determine the rescreening age subgroup with lesion prevalence most comparable with 45–49 year olds’ index screening results. The main study findings are: (1) the proportion of first-time screening colonoscopies in 45–49 year olds increased by just over 8%, from 3.5% in Period I to 11.6% in Period II, while decreasing modestly (a net decline of 8.7%) across all other age categories; (2) Period II detection rates for all lesions were only slightly higher for 50–54 year olds than for 45–49 year olds; (3) for nearly all lesions and in nearly all age groups, detection rates were higher in Period II; and (4) lesion prevalence for index screening colonoscopy findings in 45–49 year olds was most closely matched to rescreening colonoscopic findings in 60–64 year olds. The authors are to be complimented for their well-organized and thoughtful reporting of this first observation of screening colonoscopy uptake of 45–49 year olds. They have established a reporting framework for other investigators. Because of feasibility issues, data on CRCs detected were not available, a minor limitation given the likely imprecise point estimates for any age category and for both reporting periods. Prevalence of any adenoma and advanced adenoma are broadly comparable with previous reports of screening colonoscopy in persons younger than 50 years,9Peery A.F. Crockett S.D.

We have begun seeing 45–49 year olds for screening colonoscopy or for diagnostic colonoscopy following a positive noninvasive screening test, and separately see ADRs increasing through quality improvement initiatives and advances in technology. What remains uncertain is their generalizability: how well do they reflect what is happening in other areas of the country and in other health care systems, some of which may lead with noninvasive screening? Given this perspective, what does the study by Ladabaum et al12Ladabaum U. Shepard J. Mannalithara A. Adenoma and sessile serrated lesion detection rates at screening colonoscopy for ages 45-49 years vs older ages since the introduction of new colorectal cancer screening guidelines.Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2022; 20: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar help us understand about the early diffusion of CRC screening among 45–49 year olds? What remains to be determined? Perhaps most significantly, we see that detection rates between 45–49 year olds and 50–54 year olds were nearly the same, with differences even smaller than the findings of Bilal et al,17Bilal M. Holub J. Greenwald D. et al.Adenoma detection rates in 45-49-year-old persons undergoing screening colonoscopy: analysis from the GIQuIC Registry.Am J Gastroenterol. 2022; 117: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar who compared adenoma prevalence between these 2 age groups using 2014–2020 screening colonoscopy data from the GIQuIC registry. Given population-based data on CRC incidence, this more current close similarity between the 2 age groups should not be surprising. The modest uptake of screening colonoscopy in 45–49 year olds, with its minimal effect on age distribution, suggests that there is no need to reduce ADR benchmarks at this point. Rather, the improvement in lesion detection from Period I to Period II, whether caused by increases in age-specific prevalence, the success of quality improvement initiatives, technology, or any combination, provides support for increasing them. As a sidenote, it remains unclear as to whether the ADR will remain the only validated measure of colonoscopy quality, because evidence for other quality metrics, such as adenomas per colonoscopy,18Wang S. Kim A.S. Church T.R. et al.Adenomas per colonoscopy and adenoma per positive participant as quality indicators for screening colonoscopy.Endosc Int Open. 2020; 8 (E1560-e5)Google Scholar,19Gessl I.

What do we not yet know? We cannot know what segment of 45–49 year olds has thus far shown up for screening, with colonoscopy or otherwise. Do they represent average-, low-, or high-risk individuals in this age group? Only with continued monitoring of the yield of neoplastic lesions over time will this become clearer. We also cannot yet know whether the modest Period II reduction in initial screening colonoscopy for persons ≥50 years will continue and if it does, at what rate it will progress, and with what consequences. If a large segment of 45–49 year olds chooses screening colonoscopy, it could decrease access for older persons, for whom colonoscopy for screening, diagnosis, and surveillance of persons with high-risk neoplasms is arguably more important. This possible scenario is a reminder of our need to be good stewards of colonoscopy. Strategies to mitigate this possibility include greater use of noninvasive screening for 45–49 year olds, either with fecal immunochemical testing or fecal immunochemical testing/DNA, both of which have very good or excellent specificity in this age group.22Imperiale T.F. Gruber R.N.

Mannalithara A. Meester R.G.S. et al.Cost-effectiveness and national effects of initiating colorectal cancer screening for average-risk persons at age 45 years instead of 50 years.Gastroenterology. 2019; 157: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar who also clearly show that a fixed amount of screening resources is more effectively and efficiently directed to screening of older persons. Effective use of noninvasive screening will require design of robust tracking systems, ensuring diagnostic colonoscopy for positive noninvasive tests and repeat testing at the appropriate interval for negative ones. Some degree of risk stratification for the risk of advanced neoplasia may be useful in 45–49 year olds for directing initial use of screening colonoscopy to those at high risk. Lastly, we can consider ways to improve colonoscopy efficiency among older persons by elongating rescreening intervals based on procedure-related factors (eg, prep quality, endoscopist ADR). In the current study, the prevalence of index colonoscopic findings in 45–49 year olds was most comparable to rescreening findings in 60–64 year olds, for whom prevalence of advanced adenomas and advanced sessile serrated lesions was 6.3% and 2.9% versus 6.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Although the size and histology of advanced adenomas were not compared, this finding provides some support for longer rescreening intervals, which would create colonoscopy capacity. Rescreening colonoscopy for some persons in their early 60s may be too early (assuming that the previous one was in their early 50s), because studies of high-quality colonoscopy suggest up to 17 years of protection against CRC,25Pilonis N.D.

AB  - Computerized clinical decision support (CDS) will be essential to ensuring the safety and efficiency of new care delivery models, such as the patient-centered medical home. CDS will help empower non-physician team members, coordinate overall team efforts, and facilitate physician oversight. In this article, we discuss common clinical scenarios that could benefit from CDS optimized for team-based healthcare, including (1) low-acuity episodic illness, (2) diagnostic workup of new onset symptoms, (3) chronic care, (4) preventive care, and (5) care coordination. CDS that maximally supports teams may be one of biomedical informatics' best opportunities to decrease health care costs, improve quality, and increase clinical capacity.

AB  - Abstract Background Clinical interventions often need to be adapted from their original design when they are applied to new settings. There is a growing literature describing frameworks and approaches to deploying and documenting adaptations of evidence-based practices in healthcare. Still, intervention modifications are often limited in detail and justification, which may prevent rigorous evaluation of interventions and intervention adaptation effectiveness in new contexts. We describe our approach in a case study, combining two complementary intervention adaptation frameworks to modify CONNECT for Quality, a provider-facing team building and communication intervention designed to facilitate implementation of a new clinical program. Methods This process of intervention adaptation involved the use of the Planned Adaptation Framework and the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications, for systematically identifying key drivers, core and non-core components of interventions for documenting planned and unplanned changes to intervention design. Results The CONNECT intervention’s original context and setting is first described and then compared with its new application. This lays the groundwork for the intentional modifications to intervention design, which are developed before intervention delivery to participating providers. The unpredictable nature of implementation in real-world practice required unplanned adaptations, which were also considered and documented. Attendance and participation rates were examined and qualitative assessment of reported participant experience supported the feasibility and acceptability of adaptations of the original CONNECT intervention in a new clinical context. Conclusion This approach may serve as a useful guide for intervention implementation efforts applied in diverse clinical contexts and subsequent evaluations of intervention effectiveness. Trial registration The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03300336 ) on September 28, 2017.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional prospective study was to determine the internal consistency of the TMD-7, and compare prevalence of TMD symptoms in an adult population. Upon presenting to the orthodontic screening appointment, a total of 440 subjects (316 females and 124 males) were asked to complete the TMD-7 questionnaire. A total of 108 of the participants were later excluded from the study either due to the duplicate or missing responses. The final sample consisted of data from 332 participants (232 females and 100 males), aged between 18 and 64 (mean age: 42.9 ± 9.0) years. Cronbach's α statistics were calculated to assess internal consistency. Comparisons between genders, among age categories, and between subjects with versus without prior orthodontic treatment were performed using Wilcoxon ranks sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Comparisons for differences in the individual TMD-7 item ratings were performed using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests for ordered categorical responses. The calculated Cronbach's α for TMD-7 scale was 0.77. No statistically significant differences were found in the TMD-7 scale score or the individual TMD-7 item ratings between age categories (p = 0.993). Females had significantly higher TMD-7 scale score and higher ratings for headache, pain in jaw, pain in neck, pain in forehead, difficulty opening mouth, and difficulty while eating (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found in the TMD-7 scale score or the individual TMD-7 item ratings between subjects with versus without previous orthodontic treatment (p = 0.075). The TMD-7 tool has good internal consistency and can be used reliably for assessment of TMD symptoms in adults. The use of this tool revealed no significant differences between age groups or between subjects with or without previous orthodontic treatment. However, a significant female gender predisposition for TMD symptoms in the adulthood was determined.

AB  - Severe delirium is associated with an increased risk of mortality, institutionalization, and length of stay. Few studies have examined differences in delirium severity between different populations of critically ill patients. The objective of the study was to compare delirium severity and the presence of the four core features between adults in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and medical intensive care unit (MICU) while controlling for variables known to be associated with delirium. This is a secondary analysis of two parallel randomized multi-center trials conducted from March 2009 to January 2015 at 3 Indianapolis hospitals. A total of 474 adults with delirium were included in the analysis. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in random blocks of 4 by a computer program. Patients were randomized to either haloperidol prescribing or de-prescribing regimen vs usual care. Delirium severity was assessed daily or twice-daily using the CAM-ICU-7 beginning after 24 h of ICU admission and until discharge from the hospital, death, or 30 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, hospital and 30-day mortality, and delirium-related adverse events. These outcomes were compared between SICU and MICU settings for this secondary analysis. Out of 474 patients, 237 were randomized to intervention. At study enrollment, the overall cohort had a mean age of 59 (SD 16) years old, was 54% female, 44% African-American, and 81% were mechanically ventilated upon enrollment. MICU participants were significantly older and severely ill with a higher premorbid cognitive and physical dysfunction burden. In univariate analysis, SICU participants had significantly higher mean total CAM-ICU-7 scores, corresponding to delirium severity, (4.15 (2.20) vs 3.60 (2.32), p = 0.02), and a lower mean RASS score (- 1.79 (1.28) vs - 1.53 (1.27), p < 0.001) compared to MICU participants. Following adjustment for benzodiazepines and opioids, delirium severity did not significantly differ between groups. The presence of Feature 3, altered level of consciousness, was significantly associated with the SICU participants, identifying as Black, premorbid functional impairment, benzodiazepines, opioids, and dexmedetomidine. In this secondary analysis examining differences in delirium severity between MICU and SICU participants, we did not identify a difference between participant populations following adjustment for administered benzodiazepines and opioids. We did identify that an altered level of consciousness, core feature 3 of delirium, was associated with SICU setting, identifying as Black, activities of daily living, benzodiazepines and opioid medications. These results suggest that sedation practice patterns play a bigger role in delirium severity than the underlying physiologic insult, and expression of core features of delirium may vary based on individual factors.Trial registration CT#: NCT00842608.

AB  - ObjectivesPatient matching rates between organizations can be as low as fifty percent. Challenges to matching include the variation in quality and availability of patient attributes. Here we describe the changing nature of patient attributes available over the past 11-years across a diversity of care settings in the United States.&#x0D; ApproachOur expert panel identified 64 patient attributes that are currently used or could potentially be candidates for patient matching. We identified a national sample of 14 health care sites who sent us aggregated information on the 64 patient attributes from 2010 to 2020 (inclusive). The information included overall counts and percent availability, overall counts and percent availability by race, and counts and availability by year. Only patients having at least one visit to the site since 2010 and who were between 18 and 89 years of age at time of extraction were included.&#x0D; ResultsThe aggregated results revealed that first name, last name, gender, postal codes, and date of birth are highly available (&gt;90%) across healthcare organizations and time. Patient reported social security number, work phone number, and emergency contact declined markedly, potentially reflecting privacy concerns. Email addresses (from 18.0% to 63.7%) and phone numbers (from 14.7% to 69.4%) increased greatly over the past 11 years. Novel patient matching attributes such as blood type, facial image, thumb print, or eye color are rarely collected across sites for all years. We observed emerging attributes including sexuality, occupation, and nickname with a small number of sites collecting these over 70%, reflecting the feasibility of wider adoption in the future.&#x0D; ConclusionIn this study, we examined the availability of 64 patient attributes across 14 sites from 2010 and 2020. Our findings could inform policy makers and readers about patient attributes that are used for current patient matching and emerging data attributes that could be considered for incorporation into future matching algorithms.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The purpose of this study is to identify combinations of workplace conditions that uniquely differentiate high, medium, and low registered nurse (RN) ratings of appropriateness of patient assignment during daytime intensive care unit (ICU) work shifts. Methods A collective case study design and coincidence analysis were employed to identify combinations of workplace conditions that link directly to high, medium, and low RN perception of appropriateness of patient assignment at a mid-shift time point. RN members of the study team hypothesized a set of 55 workplace conditions as potential difference makers through the application of theoretical and empirical knowledge. Conditions were derived from data exported from electronic systems commonly used in nursing care. Results Analysis of 64 cases (25 high, 24 medium, and 15 low) produced three models, one for each level of the outcome. Each model contained multiple pathways to the same outcome. The model for “high” appropriateness was the simplest model with two paths to the outcome and a shared condition across pathways. The first path comprised of the absence of overtime and a before-noon patient discharge or transfer, and the second path comprised of the absence of overtime and RN assignment to a single ICU patient. Conclusion Specific combinations of workplace conditions uniquely distinguish RN perception of appropriateness of patient assignment at a mid-shift time point, and these difference-making conditions provide a foundation for enhanced observability of nurses' work experience during hospital work shifts. This study illuminates the complexity of assessing nursing work system status by revealing that multiple paths, comprised of multiple conditions, can lead to the same outcome. Operational decision support tools may best reflect the complex adaptive nature of the work systems they intend to support by utilizing methods that accommodate both causal complexity and equifinality.

AB  - Several online calculators estimate colorectal cancer risk, but their consistency is unknown. Our objectives were to quantify the variation in predicted risk and to determine which calculators are best used in the clinical setting.We used the Google search engine to identify online colorectal cancer risk calculators and assessed the output of each for 3 hypothetical screening scenarios (low-, average-, and high-risk), varied by age (50, 62, 75 years), sex, and race (Black, White), with risk levels based on risk-appropriate values for variables in each model. Estimated risks for models within a given scenario were rated as consistent or inconsistent based on comparison with either the absolute magnitude of difference or average lifetime risk of colorectal cancer. Summary statistics for consistent and inconsistent estimates were compared using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.We identified 5 online colorectal cancer risk calculators. Inconsistencies were found in none of 5-year, 19% of 10-year, and 81% of lifetime colorectal cancer risk estimate comparisons (P < .001). For a 50-year-old, 22% of risk estimate comparisons were inconsistent, vs 33% for a 62-year-old, and 36% for a 75-year-old (P = 0.14).Online colorectal cancer risk models are more consistent in predicting colorectal cancer risk for 5- and 10-year time frames compared with lifetime. For a US population, the National Cancer Institute's Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is a rigorously developed calculator that can be used in the clinical setting to provide 5-year and lifetime risk estimates.

AB  - Background Early evaluation and effective communication to manage transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) may lead to a reduction of up to 70% in recurrent events for patients with TIA/minor stroke, along with reduced costs and lengths of hospital stay. Methods We conducted a single site pilot evaluation of a clinical pharmacy programme to improve medication management among TIA patients. The programme included a structured protocol, online identification tool, and a templated discharge checklist. Primary effectiveness measures were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) 90 days post discharge and prescription of high/moderate potency statins. Contextual aspects and clinical perspectives on the implementation process were evaluated through prospective semistructured interviews with key informants. Results The analysis included 75 patients in the preimplementation group and 61 in the postimplementation group. The mean SBP at 90 days post discharge was significantly lower in the post implementation period (pre implementation, 133.3 mm Hg (SD 17.8) vs post implementation, 126.8 mm Hg (16.6); p=0.045). The change in SBP from discharge to 90 days post discharge was greater in the postimplementation period (15.8 mm Hg (20.5) vs 24.8 mm Hg (23.2); p=0.029). The prescription of high/moderate potency statins were similar across groups (pre implementation, 66.7% vs post implementation, 77.4%; p=0.229). Front-line clinicians involved in the pilot study reported positively on the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of implementing the protocol without additional cost and within current scope of practice. Conclusions Implementation of a clinical protocol outlining medication management and provider communication to ensure rapid postdischarge treatment of TIA patients was associated with SBP improvements. The pilot evaluation demonstrates how clinical pharmacists may play a role in treating low frequency, high stakes cerebrovascular events where early treatment and follow-up are critical.

AB  - Abstract Background Infusion start time, completion time, and interruptions are the key data points needed in both area under the concentration–time curve (AUC)- and trough-based vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). However, little is known about the accuracy of documented times of drug infusions compared with automated recorded events in the infusion pump system. A traditional approach of direct observations of infusion practice is resource intensive and impractical to scale. We need a new methodology to leverage the infusion pump event logs to understand the prevalence of timestamp discrepancies as documented in the electronic health records (EHRs). Objectives We aimed to analyze timestamp discrepancies between EHR documentation (the information used for clinical decision making) and pump event logs (actual administration process) for vancomycin treatment as it may lead to suboptimal data used for therapeutic decisions. Methods We used process mining to study the conformance between pump event logs and EHR data for a single hospital in the United States from July to December 2016. An algorithm was developed to link records belonging to the same infusions. We analyzed discrepancies in infusion start time, completion time, and interruptions. Results Of the 1,858 infusions, 19.1% had infusion start time discrepancy more than ± 10 minutes. Of the 487 infusion interruptions, 2.5% lasted for more than 20 minutes before the infusion resumed. 24.2% (312 of 1,287) of 1-hour infusions and 32% (114 of 359) of 2-hour infusions had over 10-minute completion time discrepancy. We believe those discrepancies are inherent part of the current EHR documentation process commonly found in hospitals, not unique to the care facility under study. Conclusion We demonstrated pump event logs and EHR data can be utilized to study time discrepancies in infusion administration at scale. Such discrepancy should be further investigated at different hospitals to address the prevalence of the problem and improvement effort.

AB  - In Brief Opioid-involved motor vehicle traffic fatalities have increased over the past 2 decades. However, the extent to which prescribed opioids increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes remains uncertain. This study used real-world healthcare claims data to examine the association between prescription opioid dose and motor vehicle crash risk. Using nationwide US commercial insurance claims data for 2010 to 2018, we identified 772,404 adults who received incident, noncancer opioid therapy. We examined associations between daily prescription opioid dose, calculated in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) from filled prescription claims, and risk of motor vehicle crashes, assessed as diagnoses of motor vehicle injuries in claims for emergency visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and ambulance transportation. We estimated associations using a within-individual design, which ruled out all time-stable confounding. We complemented the design with time-varying statistical adjustment for other pharmacotherapies and a negative control pain pharmacotherapy analysis (with incident cyclic antidepressant prescriptions). During 2,150,009 person-years of follow-up, there were 12,123 motor vehicle crashes (5.64 crashes per 1000 person-years). In within-individual comparisons, crash risk was greater during opioid prescription periods involving doses ≤60 MME/day (odds ratio [OR], 3.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.54, 4.21), >60 to 120 MME/day (OR, 5.46; 95% CI, 4.44, 6.73), and >120 MME/day (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.31, 5.15) than during off-treatment periods. The negative control analysis supported the specificity of the results to opioids rather than to other processes associated with pharmacologic pain management. These findings suggest that the receipt of prescription opioids, even at doses ≤60 MME/day, is associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes. Among 772,404 prescription opioid recipients, motor vehicle crash risk was greater during opioid therapy periods, even those involving doses ≤60 morphine milligram equivalents per day.

AB  - Abstract Data supporting the clinical utility of multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) at the guideline-recommended 3-year interval have not been reported. Between April 2015 and July 2016, candidates for colorectal cancer screening whose providers prescribed the mt-sDNA test were enrolled. Participants with a positive baseline test were recommended for colonoscopy and completed the study. Those with a negative baseline test were followed annually for 3 years. In year 3, the mt-sDNA test was repeated and colonoscopy was recommended independent of results. Data were analyzed using the Predictive Summary Index (PSI), a measure of the gain in certainty for dichotomous diagnostic tests (where a positive value indicates a net gain), and by comparing observed versus expected colorectal cancers and advanced precancerous lesions. Of 2,404 enrolled subjects, 2,044 (85%) had a valid baseline mt-sDNA result [284 (13.9%) positive and 1,760 (86.1%) negative]. Following participant attrition, the year 3 intention to screen cohort included 591 of 1,760 (33.6%) subjects with valid mt-sDNA and colonoscopy results, with no colorectal cancers and 63 advanced precancerous lesions [22 (34.9%) detected by mt-sDNA] and respective PSI values of 0% (P = 1) and 9.3% (P = 0.01). The observed 3-year colorectal cancer yield was lower than expected (one-sided P = 0.09), while that for advanced precancerous lesions was higher than expected (two-sided P = 0.009). Repeat mt-sDNA screening at a 3-year interval resulted in a statistically significant gain in detection of advanced precancerous lesions. Due to absence of year 3 colorectal cancers, the PSI estimate for colorectal cancer was underpowered and could not be reliably quantified. Larger studies are required to assess the colorectal cancer study findings. Prevention Relevance: Understanding the 3-year yield of mt-sDNA for colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous polyps is required to ensure the clinical appropriateness of the 3-year interval and to optimize mt-sDNA's screening effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide with breast and prostate cancer the most common among women and men, respectively. Gene expression and image features are independently prognostic of patient survival; but until the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST), it was not possible to determine how gene expression of cells was tied to their spatial relationships (i.e., topology). Methods: We identify topology-associated genes (TAGs) that correlate with 700 image topological features (ITFs) in breast and prostate cancer ST samples. Genes and image topological features are independently clustered and correlated with each other. Themes among genes correlated with ITFs are investigated by functional enrichment analysis. Results: Overall, topology-associated genes (TAG) corresponding to extracellular matrix (ECM) and Collagen Type I Trimer gene ontology terms are common to both prostate and breast cancer. In breast cancer specifically, we identify the ZAG-PIP Complex as a TAG. In prostate cancer, we identify distinct TAGs that are enriched for GI dysmotility and the IgA immunoglobulin complex. We identified TAGs in every ST slide regardless of cancer type. Conclusions: These TAGs are enriched for ontology terms, illustrating the biological relevance to our image topology features and their potential utility in diagnostic and prognostic models.

AB  - Colorectal cancer incidence has continually fallen among those 50 years old and over. However, the incidence has increased in those under 50. Even with the recent screening guidelines recommending that screening begins at age 45, nearly half of all early-onset colorectal cancer will be missed. Methods are needed to identify high-risk individuals in this age group for targeted screening. Colorectal cancer studies, as with other clinical studies, have required labor intensive chart review for the identification of those affected and risk factors. Natural language processing and machine learning can be used to automate the process and enable the screening of large numbers of patients. This study developed and compared four machine learning and statistical models: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and deep neural network, in their performance in classifying colorectal cancer patients. Excellent classification performance is achieved with AUCs over 97%.

AB  - Many advanced cancer patients struggle with anxiety, depressive symptoms, and anger toward God and illness-related stressors. Patients may perceive their illness as an injustice (i.e., appraise their illness as unfair, severe, and irreparable or blame others for their illness), which may be a risk factor for poor psychological and spiritual outcomes. This study examined relations between cancer-related perceived injustice and psycho-spiritual outcomes as well as potential mediators of these relationships.Advanced lung (n = 102) and prostate (n = 99) cancer patients completed a one-time survey. Using path analyses, we examined a parallel mediation model including the direct effects of perceived injustice on psycho-spiritual outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger about cancer, anger towards God) and the indirect effects of perceived injustice on psycho-spiritual outcomes through two parallel mediators: meaning making and acceptance of cancer. We then explored whether these relations differed by cancer type.Path analyses indicated that perceived injustice was directly and indirectly-through acceptance of cancer but not meaning making-associated with psycho-spiritual outcomes. Results did not differ between lung and prostate cancer patients.Advanced cancer patients with greater perceived injustice are at higher risk for poor psycho-spiritual outcomes. Acceptance of cancer, but not meaning making, explained relationships between cancer-related perceived injustice and psycho-spiritual outcomes. Findings support testing acceptance-based interventions to address perceived injustice in advanced cancer patients.

AB  - Data are lacking regarding the risk of viral SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large indoor sporting event involving fans utilizing a controlled environment. We sought to describe case characteristics, mitigation protocols used, variants detected, and secondary infections detected during the 2021 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Basketball Tournament involving collegiate athletes from across the U.S.This retrospective cohort study used data collected from March 16 to April 3, 2021, as part of a closed environment which required daily reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, social distancing, universal masking, and limited contact between tiers of participants. Nearly 3000 players, staff, and vendors participated in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between cases and noninfected individuals. The main outcome of interest was transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as measured by the number of new infections and variant(s) detected among positive cases. Secondary infections were identified through contact tracing by public health officials.Out of 2660 participants, 15 individuals (0.56%) screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four cases involved players or officials, and all cases were detected before any individual played in or officiated a game. Secondary transmissions all occurred outside the controlled environment. Among those disqualified from the tournament (4 cases; 26.7%), all individuals tested positive for the Iota variant (B.1.526). All other cases involved the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Nearly all teams (N = 58; 85.3%) reported that some individuals had received at least one dose of a vaccine. Overall, 17.9% of participants either had at least one dose of the vaccine or possessed documented infection within 90 days of the tournament.In this retrospective cohort study of the 2021 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament closed environment, only a few cases were detected, and they were discovered in advance of potential exposure. These findings support the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for large indoor sporting events during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in healthcare and rapid increases in virtual healthcare delivery. The full effects of these shifts remain unknown. Understanding effects of these disruptions is particularly relevant for patients with chronic pain, which typically requires consistent engagement in treatment to maximize benefit, and for Black patients, given documented racial disparities in pain treatment and telehealth delivery. To understand how Black patients with chronic pain experienced pandemic-related changes in healthcare delivery. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews Black veterans with chronic pain. Participants described decreased ability to self-manage their chronic pain, obtain nonpharmacological services such as physical therapy, see their primary care providers, and schedule surgery. Most did not believe telehealth met their needs, describing feeling inadequately assessed for their pain and noting that beyond renewing prescriptions, telehealth visits were not that useful. Some believed their communication with their providers suffered from a lack of in-person contact. Others, however, were willing to accept this tradeoff to prevent possible exposure to COVID-19, and some appreciated the convenience of being able to access healthcare from home. Black patients with chronic pain described mostly negative effects from the shift to telecare after the pandemic’s onset. Given existing disparities and likely persistence of virtual care, research on the longer-term effects of virtual pain care for Black patients is needed.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are a common underlying cause of symptoms among low-risk chest pain patients evaluated in the emergency department setting. However, anxiety is often undiagnosed and undertreated in any setting, and causes considerable functional impairment to work, family, and social life.The Patient-Centered Treatment of Anxiety after Low-Risk Chest Pain in the Emergency Room (PACER) study is a pragmatic randomized trial to test the comparative effectiveness of existing anxiety treatments of graduated intensities and determine what options work best for patient subgroups based on anxiety severity and other comorbidities.The PACER trial will enroll 375 emergency department patients with low-risk chest pain and anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 8) and randomize them to either: 1) referral to primary care with enhanced care coordination, 2) online self-administered cognitive behavioral therapy with guided peer support, or 3) therapist-administered cognitive behavior therapy. Outcomes include anxiety symptoms (primary) as well as physical symptom burden, depression symptoms, functional impairment, ED recidivism, and occurrence of major adverse cardiac events. Statistical analyses will be conducted primarily using linear mixed models to perform a repeated measures analysis of patient-reported outcomes, assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-ups.PACER is an innovative and pragmatic clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of several evidence-based telecare-delivered treatments for anxiety. Results have the potential to inform clinical guidelines for evaluation and management of low-risk chest pain patients and promote adoption of findings in ED departments across the country.

AB  - Patients with hematologic malignancies are more optimistic than their oncologists and their expectations may be a barrier to timely hospice care. Patient expectations toward the end of life (EOL), however, have not been characterized. In this study, we analyzed interviews of bereaved caregivers to understand the expectations of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and the factors that influenced those expectations, from diagnosis until death. Bereaved caregivers (n = 19) participated in an in-depth interview that included open-ended and semi-structured prompts, within 18 months following patient death. Interviews were analyzed using a modified grounded theory qualitative approach and constant comparative methods. We identified three themes relevant to expectations: Taking Stock, Being Stuck, and Disruption. Caregivers described clear and optimistic early expectations that AML is treatable. It was understood that treatment was required to survive. Later, when treatment options were limited, patients and caregivers became stuck in a belief that the patient could continue to live indefinitely on supportive care or at least until new more effective treatments were available. Caregivers often realized that the patient was at the end of life only when faced with a disruption, an event or conversation that changed their expectations for indefinite patient survival. Caregivers described continued expectations for patient survival until presented with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. The study suggests patients and caregivers may make better EOL care decisions if their early optimism is deliberately moderated by ongoing conversations with clinicians that highlight the sentinel events that signal treatment failure and explain how expectations and goals are changing from living a longer life to dying a more comfortable death.

AB  - This article describes the implementation of a privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) solution across PCORnet®, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network.Using a PPRL solution from Datavant, we quantified the degree of patient overlap across the network and report a de-duplicated analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the PCORnet population.There were ∼170M patient records across the responding Network Partners, with ∼138M (81%) of those corresponding to a unique patient. 82.1% of patients were found in a single partner and 14.7% were in 2. The percentage overlap between Partners ranged between 0% and 80% with a median of 0%. Linking patients' electronic health records with claims increased disease prevalence in every clinical characteristic, ranging between 63% and 173%.The overlap between Partners was variable and depended on timeframe. However, patient data linkage changed the prevalence profile of the PCORnet patient population.This project was one of the largest linkage efforts of its kind and demonstrates the potential value of record linkage. Linkage between Partners may be most useful in cases where there is geographic proximity between Partners, an expectation that potential linkage Partners will be able to fill gaps in data, or a longer study timeframe.

AB  - In this study, we provide updated information on salaries of academic health administration (HA) faculty members based on data collected in 2015, 2018, and 2021 and examine characteristics associated with earnings. We present mean inflation-adjusted salaries by demographic characteristics, education, experience, productivity, and job activities. We find that salaries of assistant, associate, and full professors have kept up with inflation and there have not been significant changes in salary by any characteristics over time. As in previous iterations of similar survey data, there remain differences in salary by both gender and race. Higher salaries were associated with having a 12-month contract, being tenured or tenure-track, having an administrative position, and being in a department whose focus is not primarily teaching. Findings from our study will be of interest to individuals on the HA job market, hiring committees, and doctoral students preparing for a position after graduation.

AB  - The objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of a remote physical activity monitoring program, quantify baseline activity levels, and examine predictors of activity among rurally residing adults with Parkinson disease (PD) or stroke. Thirty-day observational study. Participants completed standardized assessments, connected a wearable device, and synced daily step counts via a remote monitoring platform. Community-based remote monitoring. Rurally residing adults with PD or stroke enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. N/A. Feasibility was evaluated using recruitment data (response rates), study completion (completed assessments and connected the wearable device), and device adherence (days recording ≥100 steps). Daily step counts were examined descriptively. Predictors of daily steps were explored across the full sample, then by diagnosis, using linear mixed-effects regression analyses. Forty participants (n=20 PD; n=20 stroke) were included in the analysis with a mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.6) years. Participants resided 252.6 (105.6) miles from the coordinating site. Recruitment response rates were 11% (PD) and 6% (stroke). Study completion rates were 71% (PD) and 80% (stroke). Device adherence rates were 97.0% (PD) and 95.2% (stroke). Participants with PD achieved a median [interquartile range] of 2618 [3896] steps per day and participants with stroke achieved 4832 [7383] steps. Age was the only significant predictor of daily steps for the full sample (-265 steps, 95% confidence interval [-407, -123]) and by diagnosis (PD, -175 steps, [-335, -15]; stroke, -357 steps [-603, -112]). A remote physical activity monitoring program for rurally residing individuals with PD or stroke was feasible. This study establishes a model for a scalable physical activity program for rural, older populations with neurologic conditions from a central coordinating site.

AB  - Background Understanding changes in nursing home (NH) resident pain over time would provide a more informed perspective, allowing opportunities to alter the course of illness, plan care, and set priorities. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to identify and characterize clinically meaningful, dynamic pain trajectories in NH residents. Methods Retrospective longitudinal analysis of NH resident pain scores with a length of stay >100 days (N = 4864). Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to Minimum Data Set 3.0 assessments to identify pain trajectories. Trajectories were then characterized using unadjusted and adjusted cross-sectional associations between residents' demographic and clinical characteristics and their pain trajectory. Results We identified four distinct trajectories: (1) consistent pain absence (48.9%), (2) decreasing-increasing pain presence (21.8%), (3) increasing-decreasing pain presence (15.3%), and (4) persistent pain presence (14.0%). Demographics of younger age and living in a rural area were associated with the persistent pain presence trajectory. Clinical variables of obesity and intact cognition were associated with being in the persistent pain presence trajectory. A smaller proportion of residents with moderately or severely impaired cognition were in any of the trajectory groups with pain. Conclusions We identified and characterized four pain trajectories among NH residents, including persistent pain presence which was associated with demographic characteristics (younger, female, rural) and clinical factors (obese, fracture, contracture). Moreover, residents with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia were less likely to be in any of the three trajectories with pain, likely representing the difficulty in evaluating pain in these residents. It is important that NH staff understand, recognize, and respond to the factors associated with the identified pain trajectories to improve mitigation of potentially persistent pain (e.g., hip fracture, contracture) or improve proxy pain assessment skills for residents at risk for under reporting of pain (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease).

AB  - Abstract Purpose The number of patients tapered from long‐term opioid therapy (LTOT) has increased in recent years in the United States. Some patients tapered from LTOT report improved quality of life, while others face increased risks of opioid‐related hospital use. Research has not yet established how the risk of opioid‐related hospital use changes across LTOT dose and subsequent tapering. Our objective was to examine associations between recent tapering from LTOT with odds of opioid‐related hospital use. Methods Case‐crossover design using 2014–2018 health information exchange data from Indiana. We defined opioid‐related hospital use as hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits for a drug overdose, opioid abuse, and dependence. We defined tapering as a 15% or greater dose reduction following at least 3 months of continuous opioid therapy of 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day or more. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Recent tapering from LTOT was associated with increased odds of opioid‐related hospital use (OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.34–1.63), ED visit (OR: 1.52; 95%CI: 1.35–1.72), and inpatient hospitalization (OR: 1.40; 95%CI: 1.20–1.65). We found no evidence of heterogeneity of the effect of tapering on opioid‐related hospital use by gender, age, and race. Recent tapering among patients on a high baseline dose (&gt;300 MME) was associated with increased odds of opioid‐related hospital use (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 2.12–4.11, p &lt; 0.001) compared to patients on a lower baseline doses. Conclusions Recent tapering from LTOT is associated with increased odds of opioid‐related hospital use.

AB  - This current study examines measures of work-life balance among health administration faculty prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A repeated cross-sectional design is used to analyze data collected from a national survey in 2018 and 2021. Changes in six different outcome measures of work-life balance were examined using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for health administration faculty characteristics. Compared to 2018 respondents, faculty respondents in 2021 were more likely to report that family and personal matters were interfering with their ability to do their job (OR = 1.93, p=0.001). Females more frequently reported that their career had suffered because of personal issues/obligations (OR = 1.82, p=0.003) but were less likely to report having enough time to get their teaching (OR = 0.68, p=0.026). Respondents with children 18 years or younger reported higher rates of regularly having to miss a meeting or event at home (OR = 1.88, p<0.001) and an event at work (OR = 3.74, p<0.001). These faculty also more frequently reported that family or personal matters were interfering with their ability to do their job (OR = 3.04, p<0.001) and that their career suffered because of personal issues/obligations (OR = 2.09, p=0.001). Given the implications of work-life conflicts to organizational outcomes, academic leaders and university decision-makers should consider adopting strategies to mitigate the effects of these disruptions to the work-life equilibrium of academics.

AB  - To summarize significant research contributions on addressing bias, equity, and literacy in health delivery systems published in 2021.An extensive search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published in 2021 that examined ways that informatics methods, approaches, and tools could address bias, equity, and literacy in health systems and care delivery processes. The selection process comprised three steps: (1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; (2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and (3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the Yearbook.Selected best papers represent studies that characterized significant challenges facing biomedical informatics with respect to equity and practices that support equity and literacy in the design of health information systems. Selected papers represent the full spectrum of this year's yearbook theme. In general, papers identified in the search fell into one of the following categories: (1) descriptive accounts of algorithmic bias in medical software or machine learning approaches; (2) enabling health information systems to appropriately encode for gender identity and sex; (3) approaches to support health literacy among individuals who interact with information systems and mobile applications; and (4) approaches to engage diverse populations in the use of health information systems and the biomedical informatics workforce CONCLUSIONS: : Although the selected papers are notable, our collective efforts as a biomedical informatics community to address equity, literacy, and bias remain nascent. More work is needed to ensure health information systems are just in their use of advanced computing approaches and all persons have equal access to health care and informatics tools.

AB  - It takes decades and millions of dollars for a new scientific discovery to become part of clinical practice. In 2015, the Center for Health Innovation & Implementation Science (CHIIS) launched a Professional Certificate Program in Innovation and Implementation Sciences aimed at transforming healthcare professionals into Agile Change Conductors capable of designing, implementing, and diffusing evidence-based healthcare solutions.In 2022, the authors surveyed alumni from the 2016-2021 cohorts of the Certificate Program as part of an educational quality improvement inquiry and to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.Of the 60 alumni contacted, 52 completed the survey (87% response rate) with 60% of graduates being female while 30% were an under-represented minority. On a scale from 1 to 5, the graduates agreed that the certificate benefited their careers (4.308 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.612); expanded their professional network (4.615, SD of 0.530); and had a large impact on the effectiveness of their leadership (4.288, SD of 0.667), their change management (4.365, SD of 0.742), and their communication (4.392, SD of 0.666). Graduates claimed to use Agile Processes (Innovation, Implementation, or Diffusion), storytelling, and nudging weekly. On a scale from 0 to 10 where 10 indicates reaching a mastery, the average score for different Agile competencies ranged from 5.37 (SD of 2.80) for drafting business proposals to 7.77 (SD of 1.96) for self-awareness. For the 2020 and 2021 cohorts with existing pre and post training competency data, 22 of the 26 competencies saw a statistically significant increase.The Graduate Certificate has been able to create a network of Agile Change Conductors competent to design, implement, and diffuse evidence-based care within the healthcare delivery system. Further improvements in building dissemination mastery and program expansion initiatives are advised.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if the lack of exposure to individual antidepressants at certain times in pregnancy improved maternal and infant outcomes.This was a retrospective cohort study of 2741 pregnant women prescribed antidepressant(s) before or during pregnancy. Data were obtained from electronic medical records. Analysis was limited to women prescribed one of five antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). Period of exposure was determined using prescription order dates. Primary outcomes were neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and adaptation syndrome in the newborn. Logistic regression, adjusted for maternal age, race, and insurance, compared consistent exposure throughout pregnancy versus (A) no exposure in the third trimester, (B) no exposure early in pregnancy, and (C) exposure in the midtrimester alone.Compared to women prescribed an antidepressant continually throughout pregnancy, NICU admission was less likely for women lacking exposure in the third trimester if they had been taking bupropion (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.90) or escitalopram (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85). Women previously taking escitalopram but lacking third trimester exposure also had lower odds of adaptation syndrome (aOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.48). No differences were found in other outcomes for women taking other antidepressants or for any outcomes for women who lacked early pregnancy drug exposure compared to exposure throughout pregnancy.For the five antidepressants included in this study, lack of exposure early or late in pregnancy compared to consistent exposure throughout pregnancy generally did not change newborn outcomes. The exceptions were bupropion and escitalopram, where lack of exposure in the third trimester associated with lower rates of adaptation syndrome or NICU admission. These data may help pregnant women with depression in need of drug therapy to have informed discussions with providers about the potential risks and benefits to continuing or stopping drugs at different times during pregnancy.

AB  - Importance Cannabis has been proposed as a therapeutic with potential opioid-sparing properties in chronic pain, and its use could theoretically be associated with decreased amounts of opioids used and decreased risk of mortality among individuals prescribed opioids. Objective To examine the risks associated with cannabis use among adults prescribed opioid analgesic medications. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted among individuals aged 18 years and older who had urine drug screening in 2014 to 2019 and received any prescription opioid in the prior 90 days or long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), defined as more than 84 days of the prior 90 days, through the Veterans Affairs health system. Data were analyzed from November 2020 through March 2022. Exposures Biologically verified cannabis use from a urine drug screen. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality. A composite outcome of all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, all-cause hospitalization, or all-cause mortality was a secondary outcome. Weights based on the propensity score were used to reduce confounding, and hazard ratios [HRs] were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Analyses were conducted among the overall sample of patients who received any prescription opioid in the prior 90 days and were repeated among those who received LTOT. Analyses were repeated among adults aged 65 years and older. Results Among 297 620 adults treated with opioids, 30 514 individuals used cannabis (mean [SE] age, 57.8 [10.5] years; 28 784 [94.3%] men) and 267 106 adults did not (mean [SE] age, 62.3 [12.3] years; P &amp;amp;lt; .001; 247 684 [92.7%] men; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Among all patients, cannabis use was not associated with increased all-cause mortality at 90 days (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92-1.22) or 180 days (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.10) but was associated with an increased hazard of the composite outcome at 90 days (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) and 180 days (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06). Among 181 096 adults receiving LTOT, cannabis use was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality at 90 or 180 days but was associated with an increased hazard of the composite outcome at 90 days (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) and 180 days (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09). Among 77 791 adults aged 65 years and older receiving LTOT, cannabis use was associated with increased 90-day mortality (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.17-2.04). Conclusions and Relevance This study found that cannabis use among adults receiving opioid analgesic medications was not associated with any change in mortality risk but was associated with a small increased risk of adverse outcomes and that short-term risks were higher among older adults receiving LTOT.

AB  - Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a subtype of delirium, is common in cirrhosis and associated with poor outcomes. Yet, objective bedside screening tools for HE are lacking. We examined the relationship between an established screening tool for delirium, Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and short-term outcomes while comparing its performance with previously established measures of cognitive function such as West Haven criteria (WHC). Prospectively enrolled adults with cirrhosis who completed the CAM-ICU from 6/2014–6/2018 were followed for 90 days. Blinded provider-assigned West Haven Criteria (WHC) and other measures of cognitive function were collected. Logistic regression was used to test associations between CAM-ICU status and outcomes. Mortality prediction by CAM-ICU status was assessed using Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves (AUROC). Of 469 participants, 11% were CAM-ICU( +), 55% were male and 94% were White. Most patients were Childs-Pugh class C (59%). CAM-ICU had excellent agreement with WHC (Kappa = 0.79). CAM-ICU( +) participants had similar demographic features to those CAM-ICU(-), but had higher MELD (25 vs. 19, p < 0.0001), were more often admitted to the ICU (28% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to be admitted for HE and infection. CAM-ICU( +) participants had higher mortality (inpatient:37% vs. 3%, 30-day:51% vs. 11%, 90-day:63% vs. 23%, p < 0.001). CAM-ICU status predicted mortality with AUROC of 0.85, 0.82 and 0.77 for inpatient, 30-day and 90-day mortality, respectively. CAM-ICU easily screens for delirium/HE, has excellent agreement with WHC, and identifies a hospitalized cirrhosis cohort with high short-term mortality.

AB  - Abstract More than 16 million people provide unpaid care to someone with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in the United States. These caregivers frequently report experiencing psychological and physical burden. Prior research shows that socioeconomic disadvantaged neighborhoods have higher rates of ADRD, but little is known about caregiver burden. We hypothesized more socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with higher caregiver burden. We performed a secondary analysis using baseline data on dementia caregivers (n=132) enrolled in the Indiana University Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Caregivers (TACTICs) pilot trials. Mean (SD) caregiver age was 61.6 (11.6) years; 83.3% women; 78.8% white; 19.7% black. Seventy-two percent of the caregivers lived with the care recipient and 50.8% reported moderate dementia severity. A linear regression model examined the relationship between caregiver’s national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) score (ranging from 1–100 with higher scores indicating greater socioeconomic disadvantage) and caregiver burden. The following covariates were included: age, sex, race, education, shared residence with care-recipient, health status, anxiety, depression, and dementia severity of care recipient. Higher ADI was associated with lower caregiver burden (β=-0.222, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Caregiver burden has a significant negative relationship with ADI and dementia severity (p&amp;lt;-.001 and 0.046, respectively) and positive relationship with anxiety (p=0.014) controlling other covariates in the model. Although we found no support for the hypothesis, further research should examine these factors with how caregiver’s ADI may impact other psychosocial wellbeing outcomes. Discussion will highlight the need for caregivers to have access to resources that can aid them through their experience.

AB  - Abstract Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) can be an early marker for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Data supports physical activity to delay cognitive impairment and to improve cognitive functioning. We examined strength training engagement by middle-aged and older US adults with and without SCD. We used data from 121, 059 participated aged 45 years or older from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 31 states and Washington, D.C. SCD was assessed by asking participants if they had experienced confusion or memory loss during the past 12 months (yes/no). Participants reported how often they engaged in strength training (e.g., using weight machine, free weights) in the past month. We dichotomized strength training engagement as meeting physical activity recommendations (2+ times weekly) or not (&amp;lt; 2 times weekly). An adjusted logistic regression model, controlling for confounding variables, estimated the likelihood of strength training in relation to SCD. Analyses were weighted; results are nationally representative. SCD was reported by 11.0% (SE: 0.2%) of middle-aged and older US adults. Three in 10 (29.1%; SE: 0.7%) of US middle-aged and older adults who reported SCD engaged in strength training 2+ times a week compared to 34.0% (SE: 0.3%) of US adults without SCD (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9-1.0). While middle-aged and older US adults with SCD were less likely to strength train than those without SCD, only a third engaged in recommended strength training regardless of SCD status. Primary care providers should encourage strength training among middle-aged and older adults regardless of cognitive status.

AB  - Abstract Avoidable hospitalizations among nursing home residents result in poorer health outcomes and excess costs. Consequently, efforts to reduce avoidable hospitalizations have been a priority over the recent decade. However, many potential interventions are time-intensive, require dedicated clinical staff, and nursing homes are chronically understaffed. The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project was one of seven sites selected by CMS as "enhanced care &amp; coordination providers" and was implemented from 2012 to 2020. A virtual program based on the principles of OPTIMISTIC was developed in the spring of 2020 with the goal of expanding the reach of the program’s services. This qualitative study explores the perceptions and experiences of the nurses that piloted a virtual care support project in 11 nursing homes in a midwestern state, and identified the nurses’ perceived facilitators of, and barriers to, the effectiveness of delivering a novel virtual care support program. A key finding from this analysis is that relationships, communication, and access to information were identified as common themes facilitating or impeding the perceived effectiveness of implementation of virtual care support programs within nursing homes, from the perspective of the nurses delivering the services. The experiences and recommendations of the program nurses provide insights into crucial elements important to the implementation of similar virtual care support models, and the role of telehealth in bridging healthcare workforce gaps.

AB  - Abstract Technology to support caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD) with tasks may be the next frontier for caregiving research. This single-arm 90-day pilot trial tested the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of a software system called RememberStuff® (R/S) by Eperture. We also tested R/S’s impact on caregiver burden. R/S includes a web-based portal where caregivers add information to a touch screen used by patients. R/S is organized around four main features– Calendar, Messaging, Activities, and Remember, a personalized task list. We collected data from dyads at baseline, 30-, 60-, and 90-days. Measures included the Healthy Aging Brain Care (HABC) monitor, System Usability Scale (SUS), and satisfaction scales indicating caregiver’s willingness to use and behavioral intention. We approached caregivers of patients with ADRD seen in primary care clinics. Of the 469 participants reached, 278 (59.28%) refused, 156 (33.26%) were ineligible due to nursing home placement and 35 dyads were enrolled (7.46%). Among enrolled participants, 65.7% completed data up to 90 days. 73.5% of the caregivers lived with the patients. Mean caregiver age was 59.1 years; 67.7% are female; 88.2% are white. Willingness to use R/S was consistent across time from 30 days (M=3.9, SD=0.7) through 90 days (M=3.8, SD=1.1), while usability decreased (30 days M=57.7, SD=7.5 to 90 days M=54.9, SD 8.7). Caregiver’s overall HABC monitor also decreased from baseline (M=29.0, SD=13.1) to 90 days (M=27.2, SD=12.2) indicating less burden at 90 days. These findings support the feasibility of R/S technology to support caregivers of people with ADRD.

AB  - Abstract Between 1 million and 2.2 million nursing home residents are transferred to a hospital emergency department each year. These transfers are costly, have negative health outcomes, and can increase the morbidity and mortality of residents. The purpose of this study was to examine the transfer process between the nursing home and the hospital from the perspective of nursing home residents and nurses, focusing on how decisions were made to transfer residents. Using a qualitative descriptive method, 22 participants were recruited from four nursing homes located in rural Indiana. Purposive sampling, semi-structured interviews, and conventional content analysis were used to collect and analyze narratives obtained from residents and nurses about their experiences with a recent transfer. The participants described four aspects of the transfer process: transfer decisions, transport experiences, hospital stays, and returns to the nursing home. The most common reason for transfers was an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition, and the decision to transfer was often made by a nurse. Most residents found aspects of the transfer aversive or upsetting. The return to the nursing home was typically welcomed but often challenging due to problems with mobility, medications, and cognitive changes. Participants also provided several recommendations for avoiding potentially preventable transfers including adding “in-house” diagnostic testing and treatment equipment, improving staff competencies in managing acute exacerbations, increasing staffing, improving communication among staff, and increasing staff familiarity with resident histories and preferences. The findings have several clinical and policy implications for preventing or decreasing the negative effects of hospital transfers.

AB  - Abstract Communication difficulties in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia make valid assessment of symptoms and quality-of-life (QOL) challenging. Thus, researchers and clinicians frequently rely on proxy-based measures. The End-of-life Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying (EOLD-CAD) and two single-item QOL measures (7-point item; 5-point item) have been used in several studies, though evaluation of their psychometric properties is limited. We used baseline data from an ongoing multi-site randomized trial (UPLIFT) to describe symptoms and QOL and examine the measures’ validity and reliability in 138 residents with moderate to severe dementia living at 16 facilities. Descriptive data and assessments of convergent validity and inter-rater reliability are provided. Based on assessments by 134 staff and 45 family, physical symptoms, physical distress, and emotional distress were reported as infrequent by staff and family; indications of well-being were more frequently observed. Median QOL was the same for staff and family observers (4=“Life is so-so” [7-point item]; 3=“Fair” [5-point item]). Inter-observer assessments of resident QOL (staff vs. family) were correlated (7-point item: r=0.47, ICC=.643; 5-point item: r=0.48, ICC=.645, p&amp;lt;.05 for all). Seven of 18 EOLD-CAD symptoms were significantly positively correlated. ICC values varied between high or moderately high: shortness-of-breath (ICC=.74), choking (ICC=.65), gurgling (ICC=.81), agitation (ICC=.51), fear (ICC=.46), crying (ICC=.65), peace (ICC=.57), and care resistance (ICC=.68) (p&amp;lt;.05 for all). Choking and gurgling were the most prominently reported symptoms by both groups.Early findings provide a contemporary assessment of QOL and symptoms among NH residents with dementia. Measurement properties affirm general reliability and validity of study instruments.

AB  - Abstract Familial dyads experience illness as an interdependent unit. We evaluate the association of quality of life (QOL), as measured by physical (PCS) and mental health component (MCS) scores, with depression in dyads of older primary care patients and a family member. This is a cross sectional, descriptive study where QOL and depression were measured concurrently in the dyad using baseline data from 1809 dyads enrolled in a trial testing the benefits and harms of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening. QOL was measured with the SF-36, depression was measured with the PHQ-9, and the association of depression with QOL was examined using an actor-partner interdependence model with distinguishable dyads. Patient mean (SD) age was 73.7 (5.7) years; 53.1% women; 85.1% white; 13.4% black. Family member mean (SD) age was 64.2 (13) years; 67.7% women; 13.4% black. A patient’s spouse/partner were 64.8% of family members. After controlling for dyadic relationship and gender, significant actor effects of depression on PCS for patient (β= -1.39; p&amp;lt; 0.001) and family member (β =-0.954; p&amp;lt; 0.001), and significant partner effects of depression on PCS for patient (β=-0.15, p&amp;lt; 0.05) and family member (β =-0.18; p&amp;lt; 0.01). There were significant actor effects of depression on MCS for patient (β =-1.2; p&amp;lt; 0.001) and family member (β=-1.2; p&amp;lt; 0.001), but depression had a significant partner effect on MCS only for patient (β = -0.08; p&amp;lt; 0.05). Among dyads participating in an ADRD screening trial, dyads with higher depression had lower QOL. Family member depression was associated with decreased family member and patient QOL.

AB  - Abstract We explore the feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with surrogate decision makers (SDMs) of critically ill hospitalized adults, to obtain in-the-moment participant-reported data. In this small pilot, 23 SDMs were approached. 82.6% were white, 53.9% were female, and 53.9% were 55 years and older. 25% were spouse or partner, 25% were adult children, 30% were parents, and 20% were other relations. Average ICU length of stay was 13.46 days (range 1.73-77.79). 13 SDMs enrolled (56.52%). Using Twilio, an automated text was sent to SDMs containing a secure link to the surveys. Up to five questions about anxiety, depression, distress, communication, and spiritual well-being were sent up to twice per day. Most participants (84.62%) completed EMA surveys for 5 or more days. Most SDMs stated that the surveys were not burdensome. Of those who declined participation (n= 10), accessibility to a smartphone, stress, and availability to complete texted surveys were noted as barriers to participation. The data suggest that EMA is a valuable tool to inform clinical interventionists and care providers interacting with SDMs. Future research will assess EMA with a larger group of SDMs, utilizing questions that help identify gaps in communication and opportunities to provide support to SDMs. Although surrogates are often under high stress in the ICU setting, they are willing to provide real-time EMA feedback on their experiences. EMA can provide a “just in time” option for research and clinical intervention that focuses on bridging gaps that may contribute to better outcomes for SDMs.

AB  - Abstract Brief, reliable assessment tools are highly valued in both research and clinical settings. The single-item Distress Thermometer (DT) asks participants to rank their overall level of distress from zero to ten. Similar measures of distress perform well in oncology populations, but the validity of the DT has not been well tested with other populations. To determine its validity and reliability, we analyzed data from family surrogates (n=188) of critically ill ICU patients. Surrogates were asked to rate their distress during the first four days of the patient’s ICU stay and 6-8 weeks after discharge (n=127). Data were analyzed using Spearman non-parametric correlation due to the distributions of the data. DT scores at both baseline and follow-up were significantly correlated with anxiety (GAD-7: correlation coefficient (ρ)=.527, p&amp;lt;.0001; ρ=.543, p&amp;lt;.0001, respectively), depression (PHQ-9: ρ=.480, p&amp;lt;.0001; ρ=.399, p=.0002), distress (Kessler-6: ρ=.477, p&amp;lt;.0001; ρ=.528, p&amp;lt;.0001), and negative religious coping (ρ=.149, p=.0426; ρ=.238, p=.0074). Results also indicated that spiritual well-being at baseline and follow-up (FACIT: ρ=-.391, p&amp;lt;.0001, ρ=-.443, p&amp;lt;.0001) and positive religious coping at baseline (RCOPE: ρ=-.164, p=.0253) have an inverse relationship with overall distress. At baseline, surrogates with better positive religious coping and/or more involvement in organizational religious activity (ρ=-.189, p=.0106) were more likely to report lower distress. The DT could be an efficient, single item predictor of outcomes that impact patient and family care. Future research could confirm its validity as a measure of distress, in a variety of clinical populations and environments that could inform clinical care for patients and families.

AB  - Abstract The enrollment of human subjects is crucial for the success of clinical trials. In the ongoing “Reducing the Risk of Dementia through Deprescribing” trial, the initial approach for enrolling subjects did not meet expected goals in the first 6 months, creating the need for innovative nudge strategies. We used an Agile methodology as the framework to understand the problem, then find and implement a solution. Our study aimed to examine the effectiveness of utilizing a texting nudge to enhance post-agreement recruitment of subjects with cognitive impairments. Prior to enrollment, eligible potential participants were contacted using a texting nudge. Potential participants received a second contact call to remind subjects of the enrollment appointment, introduce the person and the phone number that would call them, and the option of confirming or rescheduling. During the 1-week text-message experiment, 8 out of 9 subjects who agreed to participate in the study and received the text message enrolled, yielding an 89% post-agreement enrollment rate compared to a baseline rate of 44% prior to introducing this nudge. After implementing into the standard operating procedures, the 6-month average rate of enrollment among those that agreed rose to 80%, nearly doubling the rate from the first 6 months of the study and quadrupling the number enrolled each month. Inadequate recruitment has necessitated the use of innovative recruitment methods. Using the Agile problem-solving mindset, the texting nudge was developed to leverage the behavioral influences of the messenger, social commitments, priming and affect to increase subject enrollment.

AB  - Abstract Many people receive care near or at the end of life in nursing homes, including 70% of people with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Studies have documented unmet needs for symptom management and frequent transitions of care for nursing home residents. Despite this, access to palliative care for nursing home residents is inconsistent. The COVID-19 pandemic both highlighted and exacerbated inequities in access to care, including in US-based nursing homes, as well as globally. COVID-19 specific guidance for nursing homes at state and federal levels, while designed to protect residents, contributed to increased social isolation and functional decline. Drawing upon data from an ongoing study to advance palliative care for residents living with ADRD, this presentation will highlight promising practices and opportunities to deliver palliative care in this setting.

AB  - Abstract The elevated risks associated with transferring nursing home residents to the hospital are problematic, but identifying which transfers can be avoided is complex. Using billing claims to determine “avoidability” based on hospital discharge diagnostic codes ignores resource constraints, clinical comorbidities, and asymmetrical information between nursing home staff making the transfer decision at the onset of clinical changes and hospital billing departments following treatment and diagnostic procedures. Conversely, relying on clinical staff assessments at the time of transfer may be an impractical and resource-intensive strategy to drive payment reform and improve quality. Using Medicare claims data representing emergency department and hospitalization transfers from 38 nursing facilities in Indiana from 2016-2020, we compared classification of transfers using a claims-based algorithm and trained nurse assessments of avoidability. Among 960 transfers, nurses judged 48.4% were potentially avoidable while 30.8% were classified as such using claims data. Of concordant assessments, 15.3% were avoidable and 36.0% as not avoidable. Of discordant assessments, 33.1% were judged avoidable by nurses only and 15.5% via the claims-based algorithm (Kappa=0.0153). Discordance was most frequent among transfers with heart failure (64%, n=42), psychosis (74.5%, n=34), acute renal disease (50%, n=28); and lowest among urinary tract infections (31.3%, n=64). No resident demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with discordance (age, race, sex, cognitive function scale, activities of daily living, or CHESS scale). High discordance in determining avoidability may be driven by presentation of symptoms or other condition-specific factors. Policies to reduce avoidable hospitalizations must not rely on overly simplistic approaches for identification.

AB  - A number of barriers to deprescribing exist, with knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy often highlighted by prescribers within an interrupted, siloed nature of the existing health care system. Thus, deprescribing is not likely to occur without a change in the system. Pharmacists are extremely well positioned to positively impact the deprescribing process, and particularly senior care pharmacists given familiarity with population-specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of medications. Similarly, our health care partners have endorsed pharmacists to not only collaborate but to drive the deprescribing trials. Therefore, no other profession is better positioned to advocate for the value of deprescribing as a core component of the pharmaceutical care process.

AB  - Intensive care unit (ICU) direct care nurses spend 22% of their shift completing tasks within the electronic health record (EHR). Miscommunications and inefficiencies occur, particularly during patient hand-off, placing patient safety at risk. Redesigning how direct care nurses visualize and interact with patient information during hand-off is one opportunity to improve EHR use. A web-based survey was deployed to better understand the information and visualization needs at patient hand-off to inform redesign.A multicenter anonymous web-based survey of direct care ICU nurses was conducted (9-12/2021). Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders informed survey development. The primary outcome was identifying primary EHR data needs at patient hand-off for inclusion in future EHR visualization and interface development. Secondary outcomes included current use of the EHR at patient hand-off, EHR satisfaction, and visualization preferences. Frequencies, means, and medians were calculated for each data item then ranked in descending order to generate proportional quarters using SAS v9.4.In total, 107 direct care ICU nurses completed the survey. The majority (46%, n = 49/107) use the EHR at patient hand-off to verify exchanged verbal information. Sixty-four percent (n = 68/107) indicated that current EHR visualization was insufficient. At the start of an ICU shift, primary EHR data needs included hemodynamics (mean 4.89 ± 0.37, 98%, n = 105), continuous IV medications (4.55 ± 0.73, 93%, n = 99), laboratory results (4.60 ± 0.56, 96%, n = 103), mechanical circulatory support devices (4.62 ± 0.72, 90%, n = 97), code status (4.40 ± 0.85, 59%, n = 108), and ventilation status (4.35 + 0.79, 51%, n = 108). Secondary outcomes included mean EHR satisfaction of 65 (0-100 scale, standard deviation = ± 21) and preferred future EHR user-interfaces to be organized by organ system (53%, n = 57/107) and visualized by tasks/schedule (61%, n = 65/107).We identified information and visualization needs of direct care ICU nurses. The study findings could serve as a baseline toward redesigning an EHR interface.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) are the 2 most common reported sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Current recommendations are to presumptively treat CT and/or GC in persons with symptoms or known contact. This review characterizes the literature around studies with presumptive treatment, including identifying rates of presumptive treatment and overtreatment and undertreatment rates. Of the 18 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 6 pertained to outpatient settings. In the outpatient setting, presumptive treatment rates, for both asymptomatic and symptomic patients, varied from 12% to 100%, and the percent positive of those presumptively treated ranged from 25% to 46%. Three studies also reported data on positive results in patients not presumptively treated, which ranged from 2% to 9%. Two studies reported median follow-up time for untreated, which was roughly 9 days. The remaining 12 articles pertained to the emergency setting where presumptive treatment rates, for both asymptomatic and symptomic patients, varied from 16% to 91%, the percent positive following presumptive treatment ranged from 14% to 59%. Positive results without presumptive treatment ranged from 4% to 52%. Two studies reported the percent positive without any treatment (6% and 32%, respectively) and one reported follow-up time for untreated infections (median, 4.8 days). Rates of presumptive treatment, as well as rates of overtreatment or undertreatment vary widely across studies and within care settings. Given the large variability in presumptive treatment, the focus on urban settings, and minimal focus on social determinants of health, additional studies are needed to guide treatment practices for CT and GC in outpatient and emergency settings.

AB  - The Indiana Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) implemented a new longitudinal geriatrics curriculum for advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) and master of social work (MSW) learners to prepare them for interprofessional collaborative practice in the care of older adults. This paper reports program outcomes of a novel longitudinal interprofessional geriatrics curriculum involving immersive learning for these learners. Outcomes are described in terms of learner reaction, modification of attitudes/perceptions, acquisition of knowledge/skills, behavior change, impact on the organization, and impact on the patient or client using the Freeth/Kirkpatrick evaluation model. Program participation influenced graduates' knowledge of and their perceived ability to participate in team care and job selection in geriatric-focused positions.

Subsequent consideration of the design and cohort led to the addition of a second primary hypothesis. This article describes and presents the rationale for this second hypothesis. This addendum also details a revised analytic approach, necessitated by inconsistencies in the original analytic plan. The design, outcomes, and other aspects of the protocol remain unchanged.

AB  - Cancer is the leading cause of death for Hispanics in the USA. Screening and prevention reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.This study administered a cross-sectional web-based survey to self-identified Hispanic residents in the state of Indiana to assess their cancer-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors, as well as to identify what factors might be associated with cancer screening and prevention. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to compare associations and logistic regression used to develop both univariate and multivariate regression models.A total of 1520 surveys were completed, median age of respondents was 53, 52% identified as men, 50.9% completed the survey in Spanish, and 60.4% identified the USA as their country of birth. Most were not able to accurately identify ages to begin screening for breast, colorectal, or lung cancer, and there were significant differences in cancer knowledge by education level. US-born individuals with higher income and education more often believed they were likely to develop cancer and worry about getting cancer. Sixty eight percent of respondents were up-to-date with colorectal, 44% with breast, and 61% with cervical cancer screening. Multivariate models showed that higher education, lack of fatalism, older age, lower household income, and unmarried status were associated with cervical cancer screening adherence.Among a Hispanic population in the state of Indiana, factors associated with cervical cancer screening adherence were similar to the general population, with the exceptions of income and marital status. Younger Hispanic individuals were more likely to be adherent with breast and colorectal cancer screening, and given the higher incidence of cancer among older individuals, these results should guide future research and targeted outreach.

AB  - Patients living with headache diseases often have difficulty accessing evidence-based care. Authors conducted a qualitative research study with 20 patients receiving headache care at seven Headache Centers of Excellence within the Veterans Health Administration to examine their experiences navigating headache care. This study employed thematic qualitative analysis and conducted cross-case comparisons. Several key findings emerged. 1) Most patients saw multiple healthcare providers over numerous years before reaching a headache specialist to manage chronic headaches. 2) Receipt of high-quality and comprehensive headache specialty care was associated with high satisfaction. 3) Patients with headache diseases reported oftentimes they experienced an arduous journey across multiple healthcare systems and between several healthcare providers before receiving evidence-based headache treatment that they found acceptable. Results demonstrate that most patients were satisfied with their current specialty headache care in the Veterans Health Administration. Authors discuss implications for future studies and highlight ways to improve patient satisfaction and timely access to appropriate headache care.

AB  - Important changes in the delivery of Veteran emergency care in the early 2000s in the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) emergency departments and urgent care clinics substantially elevated the role of emergency medicine (EM) in Veteran health care. Focused on enhancing the quality of care, emergency care visits in both VA and non-VA (community) care locations have nearly doubled from the 1980s to more than 3 million visits in Fiscal Year 2022. Recognizing the need to plan for continued growth and the opportunity to address key research priorities, the VA Office of Emergency Medicine, together with the VA Health Services Research and Development Service, collaborated to convene a State of the Art Conference on Veteran Emergency Medicine (SAVE) in the winter of 2022. The goal of this conference was to identify research gaps and priorities for implementation of policies for three priority groups: geriatric Veterans, Veterans with mental health and substance use complaints, and Veterans presenting to non-VA (community) emergency care sites. In this article we discuss the rationale for the SAVE conference including a brief history of VA EM and the planning process and conclude with next steps for findings from the conference.

AB  - Abstract Background Little is known about the preconception/interconception health and behaviors of reproductive‐age women in the rural Midwest of the United States. The purpose of this study was to quantify preconception/interconception health status and to identify disparities compared with statewide estimates. Methods In this cross‐sectional study, we collected data on 12 health conditions and behaviors that are risk factors for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes from nonpregnant women ages 18‐45 years in rural northwestern Ohio. Statistical tests were used to identify associations between selected demographic characteristics and a subset of eight high‐priority health measures (smoking, diabetes, heavy alcohol use, folic acid intake, normal weight, sufficient physical activity, and effective contraception use); all but physical activity could be compared with Ohio estimates derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Ohio Pregnancy Assessment Survey. Results Three hundred‐fifteen women participated, with 98.4% reporting at least one high‐priority risk factor. Statistically significant differences were identified among subpopulations related to smoking, folic acid, normal weight, sufficient physical activity, and effective contraception use. In addition, the proportion of participants reporting hypertension ( P &lt; 0.001), smoking ( P &lt; 0.001), abnormal weight ( P = 0.002), and lack of daily folic acid intake ( P = 0.006) were statistically significantly higher than expected based on statewide estimates. Conclusions Women in the rural Midwest of the United States are at risk for poor health and pregnancy outcomes. Statewide estimates tracking preconception/interconception health status may obscure variation for at‐risk groups, particularly in rural or underserved areas. These findings illustrate the need for interventions to advance preconception/interconception health and improve methods to capture and analyze data for rural women.

AB  - Background: Delirium occurs among up to 80% of critically ill patients and is associated with poor patient outcomes. Levels of serum biomarkers of inflammation and astrocytic and glial activation measured at ICU admission are associated with increased delirium duration, delirium severity, and in-hospital mortality. The utility of measuring biomarkers at later points during ICU stay has not been elucidated.&#x0D; Objective: To determine how serum biomarker levels collected at one week of ICU stay are associated with mortality.&#x0D; Design: Observational study.&#x0D; Setting: Three Indianapolis hospitals.&#x0D; Patients: One hundred seventy-eight critically ill patients.&#x0D; Main Results: The median cohort age was 61 years (IQR 53.5-70.1), 56.2% were female, and 48.3% were African American. The median APACHE II score was 21.0 (IQR 16.0-27.0), and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 3.0 (IQR 1.0-5.0). Approximately 76% were mechanically ventilated; 54% had acute respiratory failure and/or sepsis. Median ICU stay was 13 days (IQR 10.0-22.0).We analyzed the relationship between serum biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin-1, 6, 8, 10, and tumor necrosis factor α), neuroprotection (insulin-like growth factor 1), and astrocytic and glial activation (S-100β) and mortality 30 days post-discharge. Higher levels only of IL-6 and IL-10 at day 8 of ICU stay were associated with higher odds of death 30 days post-discharge (IL-6 OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.49, 4.03, p&lt;0.001; IL-10 OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.49, p=0.006), while day 1 levels of the same biomarkers were not (IL-6 OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.72,1.70, p=0.662; IL-10 OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.88, 2.25, p=0.157).&#x0D; Conclusion: Measuring serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation one week after ICU admission may be more useful than measuring at ICU admission for predicting longer-term outcomes in critically ill patients.

AB  - Background: Delirium is a form of acute brain dysfunction which is associated with longer hospital stays, cognitive decline, and increased risk of mortality. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been proposed to have neuroprotective effects. ACE inhibitors and ARBs both block the action of angiotensin II leading to an increase in release of acetylcholine. As acetylcholinergic failure is implicated in delirium pathophysiology, ACE inhibitors or ARBs may improve cognitive function and protect against ICU delirium.&#x0D; Objective: To study the relationship between the prescription of ACEIs or ARBs on delirium occurrence in ICU patients.Design: Observational studySetting: ICUs in three large academic hospitals in IndianapolisPatients: 4791 patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hours&#x0D; Methods and Main Results: The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) were used to evaluate patients for the presence of delirium while in the ICU. ACEI/ARB exposure was determined if the patient had prescription for these medications 6 months prior to ICU admission. The cohort of 4791 participants had a mean age of 60.7 years (SD: 16.1), 46% were female, and 39% were African American. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (68%), hyperlipidemia (49%), and depression (43%). Delirium incidence in this cohort was 13%. Prescription of an ACEI alone (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.15, p=0.425) or ARB alone (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.07, p=0.114) were not significantly associated with decreased odds of delirium.&#x0D; Conclusion: Prescription of an ACEI or ARB 6 months prior to ICU admission was not associated with reduced incidence of ICU delirium, although further research is needed. Larger studies with medication adherence data are needed to further study the relationship among ACEI/ARBs and delirium.

AB  - ABSTRACT Interoperable clinical decision support system (CDSS) rules provide a pathway to interoperability, a well-recognized challenge in health information technology. Building an ontology facilitates creating interoperable CDSS rules, which can be achieved by identifying the keyphrases (KP) from the existing literature. However, KP identification for data labeling requires human expertise, consensus, and contextual understanding. This paper aims to present a semi-supervised KP identification framework using minimal labeled data based on hierarchical attention over the documents and domain adaptation. Our method outperforms the prior neural architectures by learning through synthetic labels for initial training, document-level contextual learning, language modeling, and fine-tuning with limited gold standard label data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional framework for the CDSS sub-domain to identify KPs, which is trained on limited labeled data. It contributes to the general natural language processing (NLP) architectures in areas such as clinical NLP, where manual data labeling is challenging, and light-weighted deep learning models play a role in real-time KP identification as a complementary approach to human experts’ effort.

AB  - Background: For older adults living with dementia, care transitions from acute or subacute care back to their community can have adverse outcomes such as hospital readmissions, medication errors, or even permanent nursing home placement. To address these adverse outcomes, Transition Care Management (TCM) codes were introduced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in October 2012. The efficacy of TCM codes has not been examined in the population of persons living with dementia. Thus, this study examines the effect of TCM codes on hospital readmission rates and hypothesizes that TCM codes are effective in decreasing readmission rates after care transitions for persons living with dementia.&#x0D; Methods: After an extensive literature review, we identified the Bynum Standard method for identifying persons living with dementia. We used a linked dataset from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and CMS claims to identify persons living with dementia with a hospital discharge between 2015 and 2018.&#x0D; Results: Our initial search has identified a cohort of 4,282 persons living with dementia.1,584 (37%) are male and 2,698 (63%) are female. 3,433 are White, 656 are Black, 126 are Hispanic, 14 are Native American, 4 are Asian, and 49 are either of another race or did not report their race.&#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: Thus far, we have identified a cohort of persons living with dementia from HRS-CMS linked data but have yet to identify who have had the TCM codes used by their provider. In the future, we will examine the effect that TCM codes have on hospital readmission rates within the studied population. Not only will this study determine if these billing codes provide effective care, but it can also tell us if it aids historically underserved groups.

AB  - Background and Objective: In 2018, 51% of the 63 pregnancy-associated deaths of women in Indiana were attributed to substance use disorder (SUD), with Black women being disproportionately affected. To address the need for more effective SUD treatment interventions, the community-based addiction reduction (CARE) program connects women of child-bearing ages with SUD with addiction recovery coaches (ARCs) to provide personalized supports throughout recovery. To identify program characteristics that influence the retention of women of color in the program, quantitative analysis of CARE survey data and qualitative analysis of CARE ARC narrative entries of participant encounters were performed.&#x0D; Project Methods: 251 women were enrolled in the CARE program. Chi-square/T-tests compared survey responses by race for treatment status, treatment motivation scales, and retention in the program at intake, 2-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow ups. Qualitative analysis of ARC narrative entries was conducted following thematic analysis and crystallization immersion analytic methods based on the grounded theory.&#x0D; Results: Statistical analyses revealed White compared with Black women in the CARE program were significantly more likely to be in treatment at intake (p&lt;.001) and more motivated to engage in recovery treatment (p&lt;.001). Despite these differences, Black women were retained longer in the CARE Program at 2- (p&lt;.006), 6- (p&lt;.011) and 9-(p&lt;.004) months. The ARC narrative entries were initially coded and emergent themes mapped well to the four types of supports provided by peer recovery coaches as outlined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration: emotional, instrumental, informational, and affiliational. Qualitative analysis of ARC narrative entries by race are currently underway.&#x0D; Conclusion and Potential Impact: The inclusion of ARCs as integral members of SUD recovery programs may preferentially provide Black women with SUD the opportunity to build more trusting relationships with these peer coaches, thereby increasing their participation and retention in SUD-related treatment.

AB  - BackgroundElderly adults with Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD) and type 2 diabetes tend to have difficulty in detecting hypoglycemic events. Over time, recurring hypoglycemic events increase the risk for severe consequences, such as hospitalization. Previous studies have shown continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to be one of the best predictors of hypoglycemia, which can be difficult to discern normally. However, CGM systems have not been formally introduced to the ADRD population, so there is a need to understand how CGM can be incorporated into the diabetes care of elderly, cognitively impaired adults.ObjectiveThe goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of how CGM systems can be extended to the ADRD population and what potential barriers may develop.MethodsA narrative review of how CGM systems are currently used by patients and caregivers was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as clinical and CGM manufacturer manuals. Subsequently, a workflow extrapolated to ADRD adults was created based on these sources.FindingsA total of 118 articles, websites, and guides were obtained and evaluated. Current CGM workflows consist of 3-9 steps. A total of five potential areas for improvement have been identified. The newly constructed workflow consists of 9 steps: (1) healthcare visit, (2) CGM education, (3) CGM pick-up, (4) sensor insertion, (5) scan/calibrate, (6) evaluate data, (7) replace sensor, (8) next healthcare visit, and (9) pharmacist alterations.ConclusionCurrent CGM workflows are oversimplified and do not detail processes that can be complicated for adults with diabetes and ADRD and their caregivers. However, more research still needs to be conducted to determine the severity of the identified barriers and how to overcome them. This project can inform future work on the integration of CGM into diabetes care for the ADRD population.

AB  - Background: Nursing homes (NHs) are important sites of care for people with cognitive and physical disabilities; nearly half of NH residents have dementia. Unfortunately, NHs continue to be plagued with quality of care issues including lack of person-centered care and under-treatment of symptoms. The UPLIFT-AD (Utilizing palliative Leaders In Facilities to Transform care for Alzheimer’s Disease) stepped wedge trial aims to address these issues by using palliative care (PC) specialists in NHs. Measuring the impact of this intervention is challenging because people with dementia often have difficulties communicating, and thus, much research relies on the observations of staff and surrogate decision-makers (usually family members). The latter has yielded a low response rate for the first timepoint of the UPLIFT-AD project.Project Methods: A brief literature scan for similar PC NH interventions and surrogate engagement in NH research was performed, with support from a medical librarian, and revised strategies for surrogate recruitment were utilized during the second timepoint survey for two first-wave NHs.Results: Two first-wave NHs (n=47 and 43) had surrogate baseline survey completion rates of 42.6% (n=20) and 34.9% (n=15). Following the implementation of the additional strategies—calling surrogates from NH phones, calling at varied times, and emailing research information—the overall survey completion rate was relatively unaffected—42.6% (n=20) and 37.2% (n=16). Of the surrogates from these facilities (n=90), 30.0% (n=27) refused to participate and 17.8% (n=16) were “unable to contact.” The reasons for refusal included “not interested” (37.0%), “too busy” (18.5%), “no reason” (11.1%), “hung up” (11.1%), and “other” (22.2%). The literature scan yielded few published articles containing strategies to improve engagement of surrogates in NH PC research.Conclusion: Strategies to enhance surrogate engagement in NH research are underdeveloped. Engaging surrogates in research requires multiple strategies and presents an ongoing challenge but represents a critical perspective for studies involving people with dementia.

AB  - Background:Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a recessive condition that predominantly affects Black individuals. It contributes to a plethora of poor health outcomes and events such as multiple organ failure, and chronic hypoxia. Additionally, SCD patients disproportionately have asthma as a comorbidity when compared to the general population. This pairing of SCD and asthma increases the likelihood of health complications like acute chest syndrome. Although some of the inflammatory mechanisms in SCD and asthma overlap, they have distinct pathophysiologies. This study explored the potential link between air quality and the prevalence of asthma in hopes of contributing to the understanding of the disproportionate prevalence of asthma amongst the SCD population in Indiana.&#x0D; Methods &amp; Results:This study conducted Poisson and Logistic regressions on county-level EPA TRI data and SCD patient comorbidity data to address these gaps. Our study yielded inconclusive results for a link between air emissions, total onsite-emissions, risk scores, and asthma. It showed that while these variables were significantly, but minimally, linked to increased prevalence of asthma when our analysis controlled for the number of SCD patients in each county the link became insignificant. Additionally, none of our variables were significantly predictive of the presence of asthma in SCD patients. We believe that either these variables are not significant contributors to the development of asthma in SCD patients, or the analysis should be repeated with data at a zipcode level to increase the geographical precision and accuracy of pollution exposure.&#x0D; Implications:Although we were unable to conduct this analysis, due to constraints involving data availability, future work should examine if air quality is associated with asthmatic events and hospitalizations for SCD patients. This work could be relevant for the implementation of preventative measures to improve health outcomes for SCD patients with asthma.

AB  - Background: Identifying patients who benefit from screening prior to ages 45 or 50 through risk-prediction models may improve the uptake and effectiveness of colon cancer (CRC) screening. “Colon Age” is a way to estimate a person’s risk for CRC in Veterans younger than age 50. The purpose of this study is to determine what patients and primary care providers think about the “Colon Age” concept in terms of its comprehensibility, acceptability, and utility for decision-making about CRC screening.&#x0D; Methods: Veteran patients &lt; 50 years old and primary care providers (PCPs) were recruited from the Roudebush VAMC’s outpatient clinics. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted one-on-one and included Likert-scale and open-ended questions. The estimate of colon age is based on relating a person’s individual features to the 5-year age group in the U.S. population of men with the closest risk of CRC based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result cancer incidence data.&#x0D; Results: 19 patients and 8 PCPs were recruited. The majority of patients (68%) had a colon age below that of their biological age, while 2 of 19 (11%) had a higher colon age. PCPs identified the tool’s potential to promote screening uptake, facilitate discussion between patients and PCPs, and adhere to current practices as facilitators. Identified barriers among PCPs and patients included questions about tool accuracy and validation, patient reluctance to receive any form of screening, and limited perceived utility for patients between the ages 45-49.&#x0D; Conclusions and Potential Impact: Using the concept of colon age to express individual patient risk for early-onset CRC was well-received among almost all veteran patients and physicians interviewed.Colon-age adapted screening tools should be incorporated into theelectronic health record reminders to facilitate decision-making and screening uptake.Colon-age based personalized screening has the potential to improve cancer detection by providing individualized recommendations.

AB  - Critically ill patients with COVID-19 experience high rates of delirium and coma. Whether delirium occurs through novel mechanisms in COVID-19 is not known. We analyzed the relationship among biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]), hypercoagulability (d-dimer), and lung macrophage activation (ferritin), and the primary composite outcome of delirium/coma next day. We also measured associations between biomarkers and next day delirium and coma independently, and delirium severity.Retrospective, observational cohort study.ICUs at two large, urban, academic referral hospitals.All consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020, with COVID-19 with clinical biomarkers and delirium assessments performed.None.Daily concentrations of CRP, d-dimer, and ferritin were obtained. Coma (assessed by Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) and delirium (assessed by Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU/Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7) were measured bid. A cohort of 197 ICU patients with COVID-19 were included. Higher d-dimer (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17-2.12; p < 0.01) and ferritin quartiles (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81; p < 0.01) were associated with greater odds of the composite outcome of delirium/coma next day. d-dimer was associated with greater odds of next day delirium (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.94; p < 0.01) and coma independently (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08-2.14; p = 0.017). Higher ferritin quartiles were associated with greater odds of next day delirium (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.70; p = 0.026) and coma independently (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.14-2.23; p < 0.01). Higher CRP quartiles were associated with coma (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.79; p = 0.030) and delirium severity the next day (β = 0.30; se, 0.07; p ≤ 0.01).Our hypothesis-generating study found d-dimer and ferritin were associated with delirium/coma the following day, as well as delirium and coma independently. CRP was associated with next day coma and delirium severity. Larger studies to validate these results are needed.

AB  - Background/Objective: Loneliness is the self-perceived discrepancy in an individual’s desired and actual social relationships. Loneliness is common among older adults and is associated with chronic illness and poorer mental health outcomes. Our objective was to determine the relationship between loneliness and quality of life (QOL) in older adult patients, controlling for depression and anxiety.&#x0D; Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted on baseline data from the Caregiver Outcomes of Alzheimer’s Disease Screening (COADS) Trial, an ongoing trial evaluating benefits and risks of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening. Patients were≥65 years old with no history of ADRD. Measures include the5-item NIH Toolbox Loneliness measure, QOL, measured by the physical (PCS) and mental health component (MCS) scores of SF-36, and depression and anxiety, measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. We conducted a Spearman correlation and ran unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models to assess the relationship between loneliness and QOL.&#x0D; Results: Patient mean (SD) age was73.7 (5.1) years; 44.8% male; 91.5% white; 7.5% black. We found that loneliness was moderately correlated with QOL measured by SF-36 MCS (r= -0.43, p&lt;0.001), anxiety (r= 0.44, p&lt;0.001), and depression (r= 0.42, p&lt;0.001), while weakly correlated with QOL measured by SF-36 PCS (r= -0.15, p&lt;0.001). Loneliness was associated with lower MCS (p&lt;0.001) and PCS (p&lt;0.001). After adjusting for depression and anxiety, only MCS (p&lt;0.001) was reduced by loneliness. Additionally, we found a positive association between PCS and patient report of comfortable level of income, before(p=0.002) and after(p=0.002) adjustment.&#x0D; Conclusion: We found that loneliness was significantly associated with worse quality of life as measured by mental health constructs among older adult primary care patients. Therefore, we recommend primary care providers assess loneliness with their older adult patients and if present, consider interventions aimed at reducing loneliness such as activities that maintainmeaningful social relationships

AB  - We sought to examine the effectiveness of an acute prolonged exercise session on post-exercise executive function in physically active adults and to assess if age or pre-exercise cognitive performance was predictive of the magnitude of change in executive task performance. Self-registered cyclists were recruited prior to participating in a 161-km mass-participation cycling event. Cyclists were excluded if they had not previously participated in a similar endurance event, were young (<18 y), or were cognitively impaired (Mini CogTM < 3 units). Immediately after completing the exercise session, the time taken to complete Trail Making Test Part A and Part B (TMT A + B) was assessed. A faster time to complete the TMT A + B was observed after exercise (+8.5%; p = 0.0003; n = 62; age range = 21-70 y). The magnitude of change in TMT A + B performance (pre vs. post) was influenced by pre-exercise TMT A + B performance (r2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001), not age (r2 =0.002; p = 0.75). Prolonged exercise had a small-to-moderate effect on post-exercise compared to pre-exercise executive function task performance (Cohen's d = 0.38-0.49). These results support the effectiveness of a single prolonged exercise bout to augment executive function in physically active adults, irrespective of age.

AB  - Abstract Machine learning models can help improve health care services. However, they need to be practical to gain wide-adoption. In this study, we investigate the practical utility of different data modalities and cohort segmentation strategies when designing models for emergency department (ED) and inpatient hospital (IH) visits. The data modalities include socio-demographics, diagnosis and medications. Segmentation compares a cohort of insomnia patients to a cohort of general non-insomnia patients under varying age and disease severity criteria. Transfer testing between the two cohorts is introduced to demonstrate that an insomnia-specific model is not necessary when predicting future ED visits, but may have merit when predicting IH visits especially for patients with an insomnia diagnosis. The results also indicate that using both diagnosis and medications as a source of data does not generally improve model performance and may increase its overhead. Based on these findings, the proposed evaluation methodologies are recommended to ascertain the utility of disease-specific models in addition to the traditional intra-cohort testing.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an emergency department (ED) deprescribing intervention for geriatric adults. We hypothesized that pharmacist-led medication reconciliation for at-risk aging patients would increase the 60-day case rate of primary care provider (PCP) deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs).This was a retrospective, before-and-after intervention pilot study conducted at an urban Veterans Affairs ED. In November 2020, a protocol utilizing pharmacists to perform medication reconciliations for patients 75 years or older who screened positive using an Identification of Seniors at Risk tool at triage was implemented. Reconciliations focused on identifying PIMs and providing deprescribing recommendations to patients' PCPs. A preintervention group was collected between October 2019 and October 2020, and a postintervention group was collected between February 2021 to February 2022. The primary outcome compared case rates of PIM deprescribing in the preintervention group to the postintervention group. Secondary outcomes include per-medication PIM deprescribing rate, 30-day PCP follow-up visits, 7- and 30-day ED visits, 7- and 30-day hospitalizations, and 60-day mortality.A total of 149 patients were analyzed in each group. Both groups were similar in age and sex, with an average age of 82 years and 98% male. The case rate of PIM deprescribing at 60 days was 11.1% preintervention compared to 57.1% postintervention (p < 0.001). Preintervention, 91% of PIMs remained unchanged at 60 days compared to 49% (p < 0.05) postintervention. Regardless of PIM identification, the 30-day primary care follow-up rate increased postintervention: 31.5% and 55.7% (p < 0.0001), respectively. There was no improvement in 7- or 30-day subsequent ED visits, hospitalization, or mortality.Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation in high-risk geriatric patients was associated with an increase both in the rate of PIM deprescribing and in post-ED primary care engagement.

AB  - To test the feasibility, receptivity, and preliminary effectiveness of peer support groups for emergency medicine physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and gain a better understanding of their experiences with peer support.This pilot study used a quasi-experimental design to assess change in symptoms of distress, anxiety, depression and burn-out before and after participating in a virtual, group-based peer support intervention for a duration of 8 weeks. Pre-post change analyses were performed using two-sided, paired t tests. Feasibility was measured by attendance data to demonstrate the use of the intervention. Receptivity was measured using a global change rating and net promoter score at the end of each session and 8-week period, respectively. During the final session, qualitative data on physician experience was collected and then analyzed using conventional content analysis.Twenty-four emergency medicine physicians participated in the pilot study. The attendance goal was met by 20 (24, 83%) physicians and 19 (22, 86%) physicians reported they would recommend peer support groups to a friend of colleague. Positive standardized response mean effect sizes indicated modest improvement in nine of 12 symptom measurements with marginal significance (p < 0.10) for improvement in guilt [20, Effect Size (ES) = 0.45] and depression (21, ES = 0.39). Qualitative findings revealed high overall benefit with few adverse impacts of participation.Results demonstrate high physician receptivity, feasibility, and benefit from participation in peer support groups. Promising signs of improvement in distress, anxiety, depression, and burn out symptoms warrant additional studies with larger sample sizes and more robust research designs to establish the evidence base for peer support in the physician population.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Due to an increasing incidence of new cancer diagnoses in the United States and longer survivorship, a growing number of patients with cancer receive care in emergency departments (EDs). This trend places an increasing burden on already crowded EDs, and experts are concerned these patients do not receive optimal care. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of ED physicians and nurses who care for patients with cancer. This information can inform strategies to improve oncology care for patients in ED settings. Methods We used a qualitative descriptive design to summarize to the experiences of ED physicians and nurses ( n = 23) caring for patients with cancer. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews to query participants about their perspectives on care for oncology patients in the ED. Results Physician and nurse participants identified 11 challenges and suggested three potential strategies to improve care. The challenges included the following: risk of infection, poor communication between ED staff and other providers, poor communication between oncology or primary care providers and patients, poor communication between ED providers and patients, difficult disposition decisions, new cancer diagnoses, complex pain management, allocation of limited resources, lack of cancer‐specific skills among providers, poor care coordination, and evolving end‐of‐life decisions. The solutions included the following: patient education, education for ED providers, and improved care coordination. Conclusions Physicians and nurses experience challenges stemming from three overarching types of factors: illness factors, communication factors, and system‐level factors. Solutions for the challenges of providing oncology care in the ED call for new strategies at the levels of the patient, provider, institution, and health care system.

AB  - Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterized by decreased physiologic reserve that diminishes the ability to respond to stressors such as acute illness. Veterans Health Administration (VA) emergency departments (ED) are the primary venue of care for Veterans with acute illness and represent key sites for frailty recognition. As questionnaire-based frailty instruments can be cumbersome to implement in the ED, we examined two administratively derived frailty scores for use among VA ED patients.This national retrospective cohort study included all VA ED visits (2017-2020). We evaluated two administratively derived scores: the Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score and the VA Frailty Index (VA-FI). We categorized all ED visits across four frailty groups and examined associations with outcomes of 30-day and 90-day hospitalization and 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality. We used logistic regression to assess the model performance of the CAN score and the VA-FI.The cohort included 9,213,571 ED visits. With the CAN score, 28.7% of the cohort were classified as severely frail; by VA-FI, 13.2% were severely frail. All outcome rates increased with progressive frailty (p-values for all comparisons < 0.001). For example, for 1-year mortality based on the CAN score frailty was determined as: robust, 1.4%; prefrail, 3.4%; moderately frail, 7.0%; and severely frail, 20.2%. Similarly, for 90-day hospitalization based on VA-FI, frailty was determined as prefrail, 8.3%; mildly frail, 15.3%; moderately frail, 29.5%; and severely frail, 55.4%. The c-statistics for CAN score models were higher than for VA-FI models across all outcomes (e.g., 1-year mortality, 0.721 vs. 0.659).Frailty was common among VA ED patients. Increased frailty, whether measured by CAN score or VA-FI, was strongly associated with hospitalization and mortality and both can be used in the ED to identify Veterans at high risk for adverse outcomes. Having an effective automatic score in VA EDs to identify frail Veterans may allow for better targeting of scarce resources.

AB  - Objective: To develop two automated computer algorithms to extract information from clinical notes, and to generate three cohorts of patients (disease improvement, disease progression, and no disease change) to track periodontal disease (PD) change over time using longitudinal electronic dental records (EDR). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 28,908 patients who received a comprehensive oral evaluation between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2014, at Indiana University School of Dentistry (IUSD) clinics. We utilized various Python libraries, such as Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and a natural language tool kit to develop and test computer algorithms. We tested the performance through a manual review process by generating a confusion matrix. We calculated precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to evaluate the performances of the algorithms. Finally, we evaluated the density of longitudinal EDR data for the following follow-up times: (1) None; (2) Up to 5 years; (3) &gt; 5 and ≤ 10 years; and (4) &gt;10 and ≤ 15 years. Results: Thirty-four percent (n = 9954) of the study cohort had up to five years of follow-up visits, with an average of 2.78 visits with periodontal charting information. For clinician-documented diagnoses from clinical notes, 42% of patients (n = 5562) had at least two PD diagnoses to determine their disease change. In this cohort, with clinician-documented diagnoses, 72% percent of patients (n = 3919) did not have a disease status change between their first and last visits, 669 (13%) patients’ disease status progressed, and 589 (11%) patients’ disease improved. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing longitudinal EDR data to track disease changes over 15 years during the observation study period. We provided detailed steps and computer algorithms to clean and preprocess the EDR data and generated three cohorts of patients. This information can now be utilized for studying clinical courses using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of cognitive training on the risk of experiencing a fall across 10 years. The study used data from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) randomized controlled trial. Older adults aged 65-94 were randomly assigned to speed of processing, memory, or reasoning training or to a no-contact control group (n = 2802). The experience of a fall in the prior two months was assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years posttest. Cox proportional hazards explored group differences in the total sample, as well as group differences for participants classified as low risk (n = 2360) and high risk (n = 442) for future falls. The data were censored at the first reported fall postbaseline. After baseline, 983 (35.08%) participants across the full sample reported a fall. There were no significant effects of the training in the full sample or in the low-risk sample of participants. However, the participants at greater risk for future falls in the speed of processing training group were 31% less likely (HR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.998, p = 0.049) to experience a subsequent fall across ten years compared to the control group. Reasoning and memory training did not reduce a future fall in the high-risk sample. The speed of processing training reduced the risk of future falls across ten years in the high-risk participants. Future work should examine moderators and mediators of training in at-risk samples.

AB  - Background and objectivesMedical notes are narratives that describe the health of the patient in free text format. These notes can be more informative than structured data such as the history of medications or disease conditions. They are routinely collected and can be used to evaluate the patient's risk for developing chronic diseases such as dementia. This study investigates different methodologies for transforming routine care notes into dementia risk classifiers and evaluates the generalizability of these classifiers to new patients and new health care institutions.MethodsThe notes collected over the relevant history of the patient are lengthy. In this study, TF-ICF is used to select keywords with the highest discriminative ability between at risk dementia patients and healthy controls. The medical notes are then summarized in the form of occurrences of the selected keywords. Two different encodings of the summary are compared. The first encoding consists of the average of the vector embedding of each keyword occurrence as produced by the BERT or Clinical BERT pre-trained language models. The second encoding aggregates the keywords according to UMLS concepts and uses each concept as an exposure variable. For both encodings, misspellings of the selected keywords are also considered in an effort to improve the predictive performance of the classifiers. A neural network is developed over the first encoding and a gradient boosted trees model is applied to the second encoding. Patients from a single health care institution are used to develop all the classifiers which are then evaluated on held-out patients from the same health care institution as well as test patients from two other health care institutions.ResultsThe results indicate that it is possible to identify patients at risk for dementia one year ahead of the onset of the disease using medical notes with an AUC of 75% when a gradient boosted trees model is used in conjunction with exposure variables derived from UMLS concepts. However, this performance is not maintained with an embedded feature space and when the classifier is applied to patients from other health care institutions. Moreover, an analysis of the top predictors of the gradient boosted trees model indicates that different features inform the classification depending on whether or not spelling variants of the keywords are included.ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that medical notes can enable risk prediction models for complex chronic diseases such as dementia. However, additional research efforts are needed to improve the generalizability of these models. These efforts should take into consideration the length and localization of the medical notes; the availability of sufficient training data for each disease condition; and the variabilities resulting from different feature engineering techniques.

AB  - Abstract Many questions regarding the clinical management of people experiencing pain and related health policy decision-making may best be answered by pragmatic controlled trials. To generate clinically relevant and widely applicable findings, such trials aim to reproduce elements of routine clinical care or are embedded within clinical workflows. In contrast with traditional efficacy trials, pragmatic trials are intended to address a broader set of external validity questions critical for stakeholders (clinicians, healthcare leaders, policymakers, insurers, and patients) in considering the adoption and use of evidence-based treatments in daily clinical care. This article summarizes methodological considerations for pragmatic trials, mainly concerning methods of fundamental importance to the internal validity of trials. The relationship between these methods and common pragmatic trials methods and goals is considered, recognizing that the resulting trial designs are highly dependent on the specific research question under investigation. The basis of this statement was an Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) systematic review of methods and a consensus meeting. The meeting was organized by the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public–private partnership. The consensus process was informed by expert presentations, panel and consensus discussions, and a preparatory systematic review. In the context of pragmatic trials of pain treatments, we present fundamental considerations for the planning phase of pragmatic trials, including the specification of trial objectives, the selection of adequate designs, and methods to enhance internal validity while maintaining the ability to answer pragmatic research questions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore the social determinants of mental health (SDoMH) by race/ethnicity in a sample with equal access to healthcare. Using an adaptation of the World Health Organization’s SDoMH Framework, this secondary analysis examines the socio-economic factors that make up the SDoMH by race/ethnicity. Method This paper employed configurational comparative methods (CCMs) to analyze various racial/ethnic subsets from quantitative survey data from ( N = 327) active-duty Army wives. Data was collected in 2012 by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Results Initial exploratory analysis revealed the highest-scoring factors for each racial/ethnic subgroup: non-Hispanic Black : employment and a history of adverse childhood events (ACEs); Hispanic : living off post and a recent childbirth; junior enlisted non-Hispanic White : high work-family conflict and ACEs; non-Hispanic other race : high work-family conflict and not having a military history. Final analysis showed four models consistently explained clinically significant depression symptoms and four models consistently explained the absence of clinical depression symptoms, providing a solution for each racial/ethnic minority group (non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, junior enlisted non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic other). Discussion These findings highlight that Army wives are not a monolithic group, despite their collective exposure to military-specific stressors. These findings also highlight the potential for applying configurational approaches to gain new insights into mental health outcomes for social science and clinical researchers.

AB  - Background Emerging research has demonstrated that organizational efforts at becoming secondary traumatic stress (STS)-informed can improve the overall well-being of the workforce, especially when implementation activity by a champion team is high. Questions remain, however, regarding the mechanisms that enable these improvements. Method This study uses configurational analysis to determine necessary and sufficient conditions to produce reductions in STS symptoms in workers as well as organizational improvements toward being more STS-informed in a cohort survey of 6,033 professionals working with individuals exposed to trauma representing 52 organizations. The Secondary Traumatic Stress Informed Organizational Assessment (STSI-OA) was used to measure professional's perceptions of how well the unit addressed secondary trauma in the workplace, and the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) assessed traumatic stress symptoms in respondents. Champions' activity was scored using the categories suggested by Shea. Results For the STSS outcome, either a STSI-OA positive increase of 10 or more points or high levels of champion problem-solving were independently sufficient for an improvement in the outcome. The STSI-OA model had two pathways: high levels of peer engagement via the scaling up of innovations using PDSAs or the combination of facilitation of peer knowledge and skills together with working in a child welfare organization. Either pathway was sufficient by itself to yield the STSI-OA outcome. Conclusions Identifying and cultivating the champions' use of problem-solving and peer engagement strategies can transform the threat posed by indirect trauma exposure into an opportunity for shared experience and healing.

AB  - Older adults may be particularly interested in health-related content on Facebook, especially those who have chronic health conditions. The purpose of this study was to compare older adult Facebook users with and without a chronic health condition on their frequency of posting and exposure to health-related content.Participants, recruited via Qualtrics, were regular Facebook users aged 50 + years. Participants were asked separately if they had seen, posted, and shared: Health-related information; about others'/their own health behaviors (e.g., exercise); and about others'/their own medical condition. Six logistic regression models, controlling for demographics and Facebook login frequency, were run to assess whether viewing and/or posting health-related messages differed by chronic health condition status.Respondents (N = 697; 77.9% female) were on average 61.2 (SD = 7.9) years old and (n = 625; 89.7%) were White. One-half reported a chronic health condition (n = 351; 50.4%). In adjusted models, those with a chronic health condition had a higher likelihood of seeing posts containing health information (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.93) and about others' medical conditions (OR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.27) at least once a month compared to those with no chronic health conditions. People with and without chronic health conditions did not differ in terms of how often they see others' post about health behaviors. Those with a chronic health condition had a higher likelihood of posting or sharing health information (OR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.27), posting about their own health behaviors (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.44; p = 0.048), and about their health condition (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.27) at least once a month.Most older adults on Facebook are exposed to and post multiple forms of health-related content. Therefore, Facebook may be an appropriate channel for conducting health-related communication targeting older adults.
